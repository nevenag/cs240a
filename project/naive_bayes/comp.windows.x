I can't find any discussion of this problem in anyresources I can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex FAQ, Gaskins's_PEXlib_Programming_Manual_, vendors' documentation).I'm posting this article by itself on comp.graphics, and virtually thesame article with a test program demonstrating the problem oncomp.windows.x.pex.  The problem is hard to describe without pictures,hence this article is longish.  If you can run PEXlib 5.x programs andare interested, I encourage you to build and run the test program incomp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approachto dealing with it.  (It depends on the utility code from the aboveGaskins book; instructions for fetching it via anonymous FTP are given.)The problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize "stitching"artifacts resulting from the use of Z-buffering with polylines that arecoplanar with filled areas.  The interpolated Z values along a line willdiffer slightly, due to roundoff error, from the interpolated Z valuesacross an area, even when the endpoints of the line are coincident withvertices of the area.  Because of this, it's a tossup whether theZ-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed.Visually, the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though theline is supposed to be solid.Using the PEXlib API, my approach to a solution is to use two slightlydifferent PEX view mapping transforms, in two view table entries, onefor the areas and one for the lines.  The PEX structures or immediate-mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always ineffect for areas, and the other is always in effect for lines.  Theresult is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines, so as toattempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines.This shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes usedin the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair "backwards" (i.e.smaller VRC Z coordinates), compared to their positions in the viewtable entry used for areas.  This means that when a point is transformedto NPC, its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line thanif it comes from an area, thus accomplishing the desired bias.I would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amountto a few units at most, out of the entire dynamic range of the Z-buffer,typically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit Z-buffers).Therefore, it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRCbetween the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fixthe stitching.But in fact, experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003to 0.006 of the range.  (Empirically, it's worst when the NPC Zcomponent of the slope of the surface is high, i.e. when it appears moreor less edge-on to the viewer.)  It's as if only 8 or 9 bits of theZ-buffer have any dependable meaning!  This amount is so great that oneproblem is replaced by another: sometimes the polylines "show through"areas which they are supposed to lie behind.I've observed the problem on both Hewlett-Packard and Digitalworkstation PEX servers, to approximately the same degree.  The testprogram demonstrates the problem on an MIT PEXlib 5.x implementation;this version is known to compile and run on an HP-UX system with PEX5.1.Open questions:    (1) Why does this happen?        --  Am I configuring the PEX view table wrongly?        --  Is there a systematic difference in Z interpolation for lines            as opposed to areas (e.g. pixel centers versus corners) which            could be corrected for?        --  Are PEX implementors wantonly discarding Z precision in their            interpolators?        --  Something else?    (2) What to do about it?        --  Can I fix my use of the view table to allow better precision            in Z-buffered HLHSR?        --  Is there another approach I can take to remove the stitching            artifacts?        --  Am I just out of luck?Any help would be immensely appreciated!-- ===============================================================================Dave Gorgen                         Internet: gorgen@ann-arbor.applicon.slb.comApplicon Inc.                                 gorgen@aaaca1.sinet.slb.comAnn Arbor, Michigan (USA)               UUCP: ...!uunet!sharkey!applga!gorgen

The problem comes when I try to display the next image. Now I have effectively tiedmyself to the colors of the previous image. So the second image doesnot comeup in original colors.(i.e. the colors it would have shown, had it beendisplayed first). I know that I can display only 256 colors (or whatever depth of the display)at a time. But I also dont want the color reproduction dependent on thesequence in whihc you display the image.

(within hardware limits)    Try to allocate a read-only colorcell and set it to match.and when all else fails,     Return the colorcell with the best match from the read-only colors     already allocated in the colormap.This sounds good in theory.  It doesn't seem to work this waythough.  If there is no exact match already in the colormap, and no unallocated cells, then XAllocColor fails, even when it has already allocated several other cells already, and there are dozens of read-only cells already in the colormap.Is this a bug?  A feature?  A misunderstanding on my part?Any help appreciated,Noel (ngorelic@speclab.cr.usgs.gov)

I am seeing a strange problem with text in clients like xvt (a simpleterminal emulator program).The problem manifests it self when the shell echoes typed characters back to theserver for display, one at a time.  The characters appear to be too closelyspaced, with the result being that the 2nd character echoed destroys the rightmost edge of the first character, then the 3rd character destroys the rightmost edge of the second character, and so on.  It looks like there is aninvisible boundary around a character which obscures a portion of the previouscharacter.  There is no problem between the characters when the shell returnsa complete line of text... only when the output is a series of individualcharacters.If anyone has any ideas what the problem might be, or where I should look tofind it, it would be much appreciated.Regards and thanks, Jon Dhuse.--  Jon Dhuse              |     Internet: jdhuse@sedona.intel.com Intel  Corp.

Unfortunately, it appears that the NumLock mask varies: from server to server.  How does one tell what mask is numlock and: which are for Meta (Mod1Mask, Mod2Mask, Mod3Mask, Mod4Mask, Mod5Mask).: eg, SGI's vendor server has Mod2Mask being NumLock, whereas Solaris: 1.0.1 OpenWindows 3.0 has Mod3Mask for NumLock.  Is there an: unambiguous means of determining NumLock's mask at runtime for any: given server?  Sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance.You'll have to check the keysym(s) on each of the keys for eachmodifier. The one with NumLock in its mapping is the modifieryou want. A bit ugly perhaps but I think its currently the onlyway to do this (and it does have some precedent as keysyms are used to differentiate CapsLock from ShiftLock for the Lockmodifier).I don't know of an accepted strategy for handling ambiguousassignments either. (ie. what if NumLock is mapped for more thenone modifier). I suppose first found is as good as any.X doesn't handle locking modifiers that well. Hope that helps,Dave LappStandard Disclaimer etc...

Let me add another of my concerns: Yes, I can buy a port of Motif for "cheap",but I cannot get the source for "cheap", hence I am limited to using whatever Xlibraries the Motif port was compiled against (at least with older versions ofMotif. I have been told that Motif 1.2 can be used with any X, but I have notseen it myself).  Currently, I have X11R5 running on eight different unix platforms, of whichonly three came with Motif. On those three, I am unable to use the X11R5libraries to build Motif clients, because I get link errors between thevendor-supplied port of Motif and my X11R5. I anticipate having this sameproblem when X11R6 becomes available.  The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5, since I donot have Motif compiled under X11R5. True, I could buy another port of Motif,but that sort of ruins the whole idea of "free", doesn't it?

In some environments(entry level R3000 Indigo w/ 4.0.5) all windows are getting properlyconnected to their designated color maps, but on others (an IRIS 4D 240/GTX;also a different entry level Indigo) the color mapping is unreliableand changes behavior when I compile at different times.  The most commonproblem is that all non-top-level windows fail to be displayed accordingto their colormap.  My application starts out by creating three top-levelwindows; in some cases all but the first of these also fail to bedisplayed by their colormap.  This is spectacularly aggravating.I would dearly appreciate  1. an explanation of the standard, RIGHT, CORRECT way to give a window  a colormap such that the Window Manager will Honor and Obey it;  2. any advice about problems that could cause my failure to get my  desired colormaps.By now I have exhausted my own attempts on this, having tried everythingreasonable or imaginable.Below is example code giving the schematic for how I have been *TRYING*to do this.

Changing yourown applications icon is fairly simple:  If you have a widget ID you canjust XtSetValues on XtNiconifyPixmap (or whatever) and you're done. Alternatelyyou can set window manager hints.  These methods don't seem to work withicons which your application doesn't specifically own.In my situation I have to change the icon of random windows sitting there in my icon box so my question is:  Given a window-id, how do you change theicon pixure ?  A working example would be very much appreciated.  If it makesany difference, I'm using motif 1.1 on VMS T6.0-5KE.Thanks -Scott :)

Jordan implemented the systemdependent stuff in a way that you have basic implementations for,call it, operating system types, then you go ahead and write a includefile for your specific machine or operating system using the basicimplementations. Since both Jordan and I haven't encountered a OS flavor yet, that is fully POSIX, we haven't gotten around toreally implement (and test) a top-level include file specificallyfor just posix. The posix routines are used in the sun specific filetty_sun.i for example, but here we also use some bsd stuff. All in allit still is probably better to implement a include file for each andevery operating system than '#ifdef'ing in existing ones. The typeof mess that can result from that can clearly be seen in the xtermsources. Even if quite a bit of code gets copied almost unchanged a couple of times, this only uses up some disk space, since only the "drivers" actually included from the toplevel include file will be compiled into emu.It shouldn't be hard to come up with a tty_linux.i file that fullyrelies on the posix stuff, but unfortunately I don't have a linuxsystem available to me, so I can't do the port myself. I would suggestyou read the README in term/sysdep and if you have any problems orquestions, contact me and we could try to sort this out. Unfortunatelywe have to rely on help from the net on this part of emu, since we just don't have access to that many different systems.Michael--Michael Elbel, Digital-PCS GmbH, Muenchen, Germany - me@dude.pcs.comIntelligenz is sowieso nur wat fuer Doofe - MiaFermentation fault (coors dumped)

This makes it lookugly until it's window gets priority.  Then Macx changes the colormap so thatthe selected app is getting the exact colors it wanted, but now other applicationsare having to make do with it's colormap.This is a problem with all color X servers (or at least all color Xservers I haveseen) when the demands of the applications exceed the size of the colormap.My solution is usually to (1) avoid colormap-greedy apps and (2) displayapplications where color is just icing on the cake in monochrome mode ratherthan in color (if this is an option for the application). - Doug Shakervoice:415/572-0200fax:415/572-1300email:dshaker@qualix.commail:Qualix Group1900 S.

The user interface to a SUIT program is editable even whilethe application runs.  Programs using SUIT are written in ANSI-C.  SUITruns on UNIX/X, Color Macintosh, DOS, and Windows ; a single applicationsource file may be recompiled to run on all platforms.SUIT was designed to be easy to learn - we view it as "the Pascal of UItoolkits."  Learning from a 10-page written tutorial, our undergraduateshave been able to use SUIT productively after 2 hours.  This is possiblebecause we rely more heavily on interactive tools than previous toolkits,and because the entire system as been designed to be easy to learn.SUIT's biggest advantages are:- it runs across a very wide variety of hardware platforms- it has a documented 2 hour learning curve for beginners- it's very lightweight; relatively small amount of codeSUIT has now been distributed to thousands of sites, and has reachedall continents but Antarctica. It has also been used in graduatecourses at some universities, including Stanford.The suit-users mailing list now has nearly 100 participants and hasmessage traffic of 10-15 per day. Some users have unsubcribed already,citing the volume of mail as the main reason. We feel that thisjustifies a newsgroup.Details of the newsgroup------------------------comp.windows.suit will be an unmoderated forum that will handle allaspects of SUIT, including:- questions about SUIT- bug reports- distribution of contributory code- announcement of new releasesVoting------Voting will begin when this CFV is posted, and will end on May 14, 1993at 23:59 EST. In order for the group to be created, there must be a 2/3majority of yes votes to no votes, and there must be 100 more yes votesthan no votes.To vote yes, please send mail to:suit-yes@uvacs.cs.virginia.eduTo vote no, please send mail to:suit-no@uvacs.cs.virginia.eduAll votes will receive an acknowledgement. If there is a problem,please DO NOT send mail to either of these addresses; send them tothe one below.The subject field must be unambiguous; for example, "I vote for/againstcomp.windows.suit" Conditional votes, which may receive an acknowledgementinitially, will be rejected. No anonymous votes will be accepted.If you wish to change your vote, mail a new vote; only the most recentvote by a user will be counted.If you have problems, questions, or comments, please mail them to:suit-admin@uvacs.cs.virginia.eduwhere we will attempt to respond as quickly as possible.Over this period, two additional CFVs will be posted, along withan acknowledgement of valid votes.Thanks,The SUIT Newsgroup Team

Ignore this.  I have delved a bit deeper (XKeyEvent) andfound what I was looking for.ev->state   has a bunch of masks to check against (LockMask is the onefor CapsLock).  Unfortunately, it appears that the NumLock mask variesfrom server to server.  How does one tell what mask is numlock andwhich are for Meta (Mod1Mask, Mod2Mask, Mod3Mask, Mod4Mask, Mod5Mask).eg, SGI's vendor server has Mod2Mask being NumLock, whereas Solaris1.0.1 OpenWindows 3.0 has Mod3Mask for NumLock.  Is there anunambiguous means of determining NumLock's mask at runtime for anygiven server?  Sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance.Thanks, Ralph

To accomplish this, we will be putting out a two diskset, the first containing what's ready and needed now, the secondavailable later in '92, containing more SPARC binaries and otheruseful material not found on previous disks.The SUG 1992.1 disk, which was assembled by Robert A.

If you are not aSUG member, you can become one for an additional $40 if you livewithin the US or $55 outside.The SUG 1992.1 CDROM is an ISO 9660 disk (which means it can be usedby PC, Macintosh, and other workstations as well), and contains atotal of 543MB of material, including:X11R5 SOURCES AND CORE BINARIES (for SPARC) as of several weeks afterthe initial distribution, thus, four fixes and the the MIT contrib-0distribution are included (109MB of material).

There's documentation on how to use the shared memory extension in theX11R5 distribution.  Actually, I just finished writing a motif animation program...(take-lots-of-image-data-and-display-it-pretty-darn-fast). When usingon-server pixmaps or shared memory, I had to insert a delay loop to keepit from going too quickly :). Testing both methods side by side, theywere just about equal.  The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesn't grow to ridiculoussizes; but pixmaps can work over a network and *are* removed if yourapplication dies (one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit whendebugging SHM apps).  Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g.Ultrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments (~6) to beattached to a process at once; consequently, a redraw becomesXShmAttach();XShmPutImage();XShmDetach(); on Dec systems. And Dec's 24bit displays (like the ones I tend to use most often) don't seem tosupport the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong?), and usingpixmaps causes the X server to crash (failed mallocs), so one *has* touse the local unix domain socket (which really isn't that bad; onecopies the info three times per redraw instead of one).  In short: allowing all three forms of display, within the program is aGood Thing (minus SHM if running over a network), and let the user pickwhatever feels fastest.  (I just use an ximagehandler class and forget about it :)  )Rob

Ifyou're a Motif implementor, I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semanticschanged to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change thedocumentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user'sexpectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing astranslations.>Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry?If you mean "menu accelerator", no it's not possible.

What I want is Ctrl+O and Ctrl+o to both be accelerators on one>menu entry.There is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menuaccelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget], set an XtNacceleratorsresource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shell'saccelerators on itself and all of its descendants withXtInstallAllAccelerators (shell, shell).For example,  applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade  -- filePulldown - openPushbutton  - exitPushbutton  *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>O  *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O  *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>Q  *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q  *applicationShell.accelerators = #override\\n\\    Ctrl<Key>O: PerformAction(*openPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\\n\\    Ctrl<Key>Q: PerformAction(*exitPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)You have to write and add the application action PerformAction, which youcan implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and thenXtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments.I tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time, Iused TeleUSE's TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the acceleratorson the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions insteadof asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach Idescribed above should work.-- Trevor Bourget (trevor@telesoft.com)

If my application depends on modifiers, what is the best lookup method?My choices are to call XGetModifierMapping() for each key press with a modifier, or make the call once at the init of the app and store the modifiersin a lookup table.  I would like to do it the second way, but I can't seem toget the notify when the user uses xmodmap to remap the modifiers.  I know thatwhen an app calls XSetModifierMapping() a MappingNotify event is generated(non-maskable) which I can pick up and modify my internal table.  But, I don'tseem to get any notify events when the user uses xmodmap.  If I use Xt, all O'Reilly has to say is '...is automatically handled by Xt...'.  If I use Xlib, ala XNextEvent(), I get nothing.  This all stems from problems with users of the Sun 4/5 keyboard and the NumLock; plus various Alt/Meta/etc. modifier requirements.2.  I would like to place a popup so that it will be to the immediate rightof my main window.  I want it at the same y coord, and their right/leftsides touching.  What I need to ask for is the x,y coord of the window manager's border for the main window.  This should ring a bell with anyonewho has called XtMoveWidget(), immediately checking the x,y after the moveand seeing that it is right, and in their next callback asking for the x,yand seeing that it is now offset by the WM border.Any help would be most appreciated.Darcydarcy_mccallum@mentorg.com

Anyway, what you say is not really true. The color informationis associated with a GraphicsContext, not with a display, and the GC _IS_a parameter to the drawing routines.So, if you need to fast switch between green dotted lines and blue ones ofwidth 2, you can make 2 GCs for those cases and then simply doXDrawLine(dpy,win,gc_red,x1,y1,x2,y2);XDrawLine(dpy,win,gc_blue,x3,y3,x4,y4);for this effect.This is eventually more complicated to do for the programmer, but also muchmore efficient and flexible. You would not include all the other parameterslike line pattern, with, cap and joinstyle, drawmode and so on in everydrawing call, so why do it for color ?

In the demo below,main() represents the main program calling my library and doit() representsthe interface to the library function.#include <X11/Xlib.h>#include <Xm/Xm.h>#include <Xm/PushB.h>#include <stdio.h>#include <stdlib.h>void bla(XtAppContext app, Widget top){        Widget topone = top;// in real prog, these are member vars        XtAppContext theapp = app;// of a class        int junk = 0;        Display *dis = XtOpenDisplay(theapp, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, &junk,                                        NULL);        Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget("blaaa", xmPushButtonWidgetClass,                        topone,                        XmNheight, 50,                        XmNwidth, 50,                        NULL);        XtRealizeWidget(topone);        for (int i=0;i<=25;i++)// real prog returns when "Exit" button clicked        {                XEvent event;                XtAppNextEvent(theapp, &event);                XtDispatchEvent(&event);        }        XtDestroyWidget(box);        XtCloseDisplay(dis);}// SetItUp - should be called once onlyvoid SetItUp(XtAppContext *app, Widget *top){        int junk = 0;        (*top)=XtAppInitialize (app, "test", NULL, 0, &junk, NULL,                NULL, NULL, 0);}// doit - some library function callable from the outsidevoid doit(){        static XtAppContext app;// use these every time called        static Widget top;        static int setup = 0;        if (!setup)        {                SetItUp(&app, &top);                setup = 1;        }        bla(app, top);}// main - program which links to my librarymain(){        for (int i=0;i<=20;i++)        {                doit();                printf("sleeping...\\n");//widget still on screen at this point                sleep(5);        }}The problem is that the widget does not go away until the new one is created.(It is still on the screen -- unusuable -- during the "sleep" in the main prog,despite the XtDestroyWidget call).Anyone see something I'm missing?Thanks very much.(Please respond via email)-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------David Rex Wood -- davewood@cs.colorado.edu -- University of Colorado at Boulder-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'd like to stay independent of Unix so pipes and/or sockets probably aren't the way to go.

In fact chipmunk is complete VLSI design tool (schematic editor, layout editor, LVS, DRC...). The schematic editor  itself iscalled LOG.The second one I heard of is called 'OCTTOOLS'. It is also a complete VLSIpackage. The fully uncompressed release takes about 130Mb of disk space.

I am trying to find the best GUI tool for our needs.  I have looked at several tools but they all seem basically the same (each salesman will beg to differ). I realize that there are differences but I don't have an infinate amount of time to discover what they are. The tools I have looked at so far are UIM/X, X-designer, Tele-Use, tcl/tk,Interviews, and SUIT. So far I've drawn the following conclusions:1) The builder for Interviews is not very mature, bad docs2) Tele-Use is very expensive and uses a proprietary toolkit3) UIM/X & X-designer seem about the same, even though X-designer does not have a interpreter (I'll by Centerline if I need one)4) tcl/tk is a little buggy5) I know very little about the ICS Builder (just have the sales info)6) Due to a corporate agreement X-designer is much cheeper than any other comercial product.7) For the time I'm spending I could have bought all of them (well different money)8) We will have to live with any shortcomings and make it work9) this type of tool seems great, but noone seems to talk about them on the net. Is there another news group for this ?10) SUIT cost too much for comercial development.I'm hoping someone out there has a strong opinion on at least one of these products.thanks ---*Bruce Trvalik  AOA-----------------**       (617)864-0201   check your mind at the door - The Band That Time Forgot*moose@aoa.utc.com*       aoa!moose@bbn.com

I remember when _SunView_ was hot stuff (and am not,by that statement, endorsing Sun and its products, this is just my experience),and when OpenWindows became hot stuff, that was when I started hearing, asmentioned before, the "socialistic masses" that were bent on destroying _anything_ that was deemed proprietary, including OpenWindows.  I mentionedMotif in the same breath, because that is what Sun has decided to turn itsattention to, not because I hate it.  Mr. Richardson's position, I believe, isa healthy one, and I am sure that the seething hackers will soon try toflame and destroy NT, if it ever shows up, wanting instead everything to befree, and then complaining when there is no organized structure and there are no de facto standards.It was just a vent for frustration brought on by prevailing winds.Mrs. Henne

I have a feeling  > this can't be fixed in emacs itself, but that I need to do some  > xmodmap stuff. Can someone help me?Unfortunately, the key event handling is pretty much hardwired intoemacs.  I ran into this problem a while back; my solution was tochange the source code so that all of these special keys generatedcharacter sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifierstate as escape sequences -- for example, the sequence "ESC [ 1 B 7" would indicate that the "HOME" key was pressed, with the shift keydown.  You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers, suchas "shift-Return".If anybody wants these changes, they're welcome to them, but you'llhave to have the source available and be comfortable munging withit a bit.  Basically you have to replace the keypress handling codein the source file "x11term.c".  Maybe if someone at OSF is interested, I can send them the tweaks, but I imagine they've gotbigger fish to fry (hopefully including the much talked about emacs V19!).  If there's sufficient interest, I'll post the mods somewhere, although this probably isn't the appropriate group for it.Notes:  * This special code will only apply if you let emacs create   its own (X11) window.  If you run it in plain old tty mode (which    includes Xterm windows) then it's business as usual. * The patches I made were to version 18.58, under Sun OS 4.1.2   [I also did this a while back under HP-UX].  The patches are   in a chunk of code between '#if sun ... #endif' but could    easily be adapted for anything else.+-------------------------------------------------------+------- /// -----+| Mark Lanzo   KD4QLZ  lanzo@tekelec.com   919-460-5576 |    \\\\\\///       |+-------------------------------------------------------+---- \\XX/ -------+

Thehardware is "truecolor" in YUV space; in X terms it has a 24-bitstatic color visual.  I would really like to have the server justpresent this static visual, but I'm not sure if this will be acceptable to "most" X clients.  The three problems I see are:  1) The colormap, though huge, is static.  2) All pixels would be 3 bytes wide.  3) Because the hardware actually lives in YUV space, the     translation RGB->YUV will introduce some rounding error.Being more of a server guy than a client guy, I ask: will theselimitations thwart many X clients?  Or will most of the X stufffloating around blithely accept what they're given?  I could writethe server to also present a pseudocolor visual of, e.g., 8 bits, but I'd rather avoid this if not necessary.I know there are no absolutes, but I'd appreciate hearing people'sopinions and suggestions.

Neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps.Standard colormaps were spec'd with the intention that window managerswould make them available.

Since standard colormapstypically devour all 256 entries, there is no way it can avoiddisplacing the entire default colormap if your hardware has only oneCLUT.I don't believe standard colormaps are intended to aboid possiblecolormap flashing between clients using the default coilormap. Rather,colormap flashing will be avoided between two clients that use thesame standard colormap. An example would be two clients that need afull color range would both use XA_RGB_BEST_MAP (or whatever it'scalled under X11R5).If you are trying to avoid colormap flashing with the defaultcolormap, your best bet is to try to load all the colors you use intothat colormap. If you can't do that, then you'll get flashing on a onehw CLUT framebuffer.Now if your window manager used the same standard colormap as yourclient, this flashing could also be avoided. Perhaps some windowmanagers have command line options for selecting standard colormaps?--    -paulpmartz@dsd.es.comEvans & Sutherland

The window-manager is not responding because|> it thinks the window is already in the right place.|> |> Exactly *why* the two components get into this sulk is unclear to|> me; all information greatly received.This problem is caused by a bad interaction between the way olwm reparentswindows, a misfeature of the X protocol, and a bug in the Xt intrinsics.  The Intrinsics bug is that it ignores the (x,y) position given inReparentNotify events.  Olwm is structured in such a way that, when a windowis popped down, the last event the client receives is a ReparentNotify event. At this point, the Intrinsics' notion of the shell's location is out of date.If a SetValues is done using the same (x,y) position, the Intrinsics thinks itneeds to move the shell, so it issues a ConfigureWindow request to move itthere.  However, a (mis)feature of the X protocol is that a ConfigureWindowrequest that has no effect will generate no ConfigureNotify event.  TheIntrinsics thus waits for an event that will never arrive, and times out afterwmTimeout has expired.  (Actually, things are somewhat more complex becausethe request is redirected to the window manager, but the net result is thesame.)The solution is for the Intrinsics to note the (x,y) positioning informationin ReparentNotify events.  This has been implemented and is available in X11R5public fix 20.  This is XBUG 5513 for those of you who are interested ingorier details.s'marks-- Stuart W.

Now I would like to display thename of the file corresponding to the value of the dragged scalebutton (i.e. with the MB1 pressed). As XmNshowValue only displaysthe current value of the scale button and not the actual correspondingimage file name, I thought of using an XtAddEventHandler to dothe mapping between the scale value and the file name:XtAddEventHandler(scaleImage,Button1MotionMask,  FALSE, SliderMoved, NULL);and in the eventhandler do a:  while (XCheckTypedWindowEvent (display, event->window, MotionNotify, &Return))   ;  XmScaleGetValue(scaleImage,&value);  /*map value to file entry in directory and finally obtain file name to open*/However, when I move the pointer in the scale widget I get callbacks, with of co   ursea null effect as my MB1 is not pressed to move the scale button. So what is goin   g wrong?Or is the a wrong approach to this problem?Any hints are highly appreciated.---Phil

I gotseveral requests to send the bindings per e-mail, and I know of several peoplewho have been using Motif++, and there are probably a number of people I amnot aware of who are also using Motif++.My question is:How many people 'out there' would be interested to join a mailing-list, wherepeople can ask questions about Motif++, swap stories, and give new ideas aboutnew directions and improvements for the bindings. This would benefit theuser-community, as well as give me more insight in what people would like tosee added to Motif++. Motif++ is still very much a voluntary project, and thisway I can make a list of priorities, in what order things should be added, orchanged.If you're interested in joining such a mailing-list, please take the time toreply to this message, and tell me so. When there is sufficient interest, sayabout 20 people or more, a mailing-list will be set up at my site, and I willpost the announcement of the newly-created list to this and other newsgroups.-- Ronald van Loon     | In theory, there is no difference (rvloon@cv.ruu.nl)  | between theory and practice.3DCV Group, Utrecht |   The Netherlands     | In practice however, there is.

This also includes the problem of notifing the remote host of the currentDISPLAY that is being used.1/ Use rsh/rexec/on...  (the method in the xauth manual)      Set up the your .rhosts file in the home directory on the remote  machine so that a password in not required to remotly execute commands.         xauth extract - $DISPLAY | rsh other xauth merge -  This method is also used by xrsh to pass authorization. My vampire  program also uses a variation, however I wrap it as part of the remote  command sequence  (EG:  xauth add $auth)     Included in this method is the use of `xrlogin' and `xrsh' to do  this job for you. These programs usally (the newer ones that is) allow  you to pass a secified list of ENVIRONMENT variables which includes  the `DISPLAY' and/or a copy of the authorization code required.     The `xon' program available (if enabled) on sun machines will also  pass environment variables, as well as the current directory.  You will  however be required to store the Authority in such a variable for  passing. Unless you are also have shared home directories.    WARNING: Environment variables and command line arguments are visible  in `ps' listing with the appropiate flags. As such passing authorization  information in environment variables or as arguments is not recomended.  The recommended method as given in the manual (shown above) is safe from  the view of other users.2/ Wrap it as part of the TERM environment variable.      This method uses the fact that most remote command executors do pass  the TERM environment variable to the remote host. It is then a matter of  an appropiate script in your remote .login file to extract the information  from the TERM environment variable and set up things appropiatly.    A version of the xrlogin script is available on the network which does  this. Basically you change the TERM environment variable before the  actual call to rlogin is performed, to include your DISPLAY and your  authorization.    On the remote machine you then extract this information and return the  TERM environment variable to normal BEFORE you use it for reseting or  stty'ing your terminal.  ---8<---  script for launching rlogin:    #!/bin/sh    # ~/bin/rl   --- Rlogin with display:    if [ -n "$DISPLAY" ]; then      case "$DISPLAY" in        :*) DISPLAY=`hostname`$DISPLAY ;;      esac      TERM="$TERM&$DISPLAY&`xauth nextract - $DISPLAY`"      export TERM    fi    rlogin $*  ---8<---  add to your .cshrc or .login    if ( $?TERM ) then      if ( `echo $TERM | tr -cd '&'` != '' ) then        echo "$TERM" | cut '-d&' -f3 | xauth nmerge -        setenv DISPLAY `echo "$TERM" | cut '-d&' -f2`        setenv TERM    `echo "$TERM" | cut '-d&' -f1`      endif    endif  ---8<---  xterm command to use    xterm -T hostname -e ~/bin/rl hostname  ---8<---3/ NFS.     Write it to a file on a shared NFS partition you have access to.   Note that if the home directories are NFS mounted, then authorization   is automatically passed, Hoever you will still have to pass your   DISPLAY environment variable via a file or other means. IE:      login host:       echo $DISPLAY > ~/.X11host      remote host:      setenv DISPLAY `cat ~/.X11host`4/ Finger for the info in a .plan file      This involves encrypting the information into your `.plan' or  `.project' and having the remote machine finger for the information.  This has the disadvantage of having the information to anyone fingering  the user.  Thus requiring a encryption method that is uniq to each  individual.  IE: the method of decyrption must not be shared or known  by others, nor should it be easy to determine.    A improvment is to use the `who fingered me' technique to only give  the information only to your own remote accounts and not just to anyone  who is asking.    This last method was developed last year by a second year here, untill  I explained to him the need for the encryption, at which point he gave  up this method. It is however a valid method. It is easer than (2) but  less secure.

The only thing remotely influenced here can be the Motif WindowManager, that features an arrangement of buttons and menus somewhatsimiliar to this of the MS-W windowmanaging agent, however its name is.But MWM is only a SMALL part of Motif, in fact, MWM and Motif can workwithout each other, and if one doesn't like MWMs outfit for some reason,he switches to another windowmanager. All this doesn't influence Motif,which is a toolkit of widgets to write applications, and this toolkitis IMHO uncomparable to MS-W, because it is much more wellorganized andfeatures alot of goodies more than the MS-W interface.You cannot say "A Porsche looks like a VW Kfer" ONLY because they have thewheel and the gear at the same position. Motif and MS-W are completedifferent worlds, only one element of the Motif world has some gear and wheelat the same position as MS-W.--+-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+| o |                \\\\\\-  Brain Inside -///                       | o || o |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                           | o || o | Andre' Beck (ABPSoft) mehl: Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de | o |+-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+

Otherwise, they would probably have gone for a commercial Unix.  An important factor in the Linux community is that source code is always  available (this is probably similar in the 386BSD community, however, I'm not  really involved there). Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting  (bleeding) edge: ie. when kernel patches, C library or compiler patches come  out, people like to rebuild their entire systems. The prime requirement for  all Linux software is that it is available under a GNU style public license.  Hence, Linux software uses either the Athena widgets or XView.  Individuals may write software requiring Motif, but I doubt it is widely  adopted.Regards,Richard Gooch....

Most generic unix software  works ok.- It must produce postscript files that I can include into LaTeX documents  with dvips. Or just tell me another free program that converts one  of the supported formats to ps.- It must produce drawings that are larger than the window size (scrollable).I know of several such programs, idraw, xfig. tgif. I haveno experience with any of them. Features I would like in the programs are.- ability to draw circles, arcs, straight lines, boxes and arrows.- support for both dashed and solid line styles for all of these objects.- support for texts in any size.- ability to move/copy/resize/rotate any part of the drawing.- ability to turn any part of the drawing into a library component  (e.g. a transistor symbol composed of three lines, an arrow and a circle)- any aid (numeric coordinates, screen grid) to align parts of the drawing.- less essential, but in fact very handy: preservation of connection.  If I move one part of the drawing, the lines that connect that part to the  rest of the drawing, stay connected.Ideally I want the tool so general and flexible that it is comfortable todraw electronic schematics, flow charts, logic diagrams, data flow diagramsand block diagrams with it. I just want to know which of the programs offer which of the features on mywhishlist and are there any other programs? How demanding are the programswith respect to disk space, memory and CPU usage? Are any of the programsknown to work on Linux with monochrome X?Lennart.

Each should start with ---author--- line, andX  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections.XX* The entry's remarks should include:X    - what this program doesX    - how to run the program (sample args or input)X    - special compile or execution instructions, if anyX    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5)X    - information about any ---data--- filesX    - why you think the program is obfuscatedX    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry.X    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise)XX* Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certainX  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award.XX        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  TheyX  should not be required to exist.XX  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info---X  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multipleX  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describeX  each info file in the ---remark--- section.XX    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows:XX   'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removedX   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optionalX       digit, followed by '.c'X   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry'sX       title, possibly followed by a digitXX       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in yourX       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute aX       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name ofX       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followedX       by a digit, followed by '.sh'.XX       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry mustX       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames.XX    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should beX       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files,X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If thisX       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks.XX    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected.X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does notX       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers.XX    7) The program must be of original work.

All other uses must receive prior permission in writingXfrom both Landon Curt Noll and Larry Bassel.XXABOUT THIS FILE:XX    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries toX    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short).XX    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments aboutX    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules areX    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.XX    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.XX    Changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars.  --->      |XXXWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:XX    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.cX    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.XX    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI CX    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilersX    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal withX    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessorX    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.XXXHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:XX    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  SeeX    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.XX    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entriesX    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one yearX    might be 'old' the next year.XX    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically applyX    a number of tests to an entry:XX* look at the original sourceX* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCIIX* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' linesX* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' linesX* run it through a C beautifierX* examine the algorithmX* lint itX* compile itX* execute itXX    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has beenX    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.XX    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certainX    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for theX    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well asX    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, givenX    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry thatX    does something interesting when you run it.XX    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leaveX    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real lifeX    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer requestX    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of theX    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.XX    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us knowX    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuseX    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to theX    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends toX    annoy more than amuse.XX    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entriesX    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to useX    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)XX    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes makeX    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularlyX    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen someX    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.XX    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims thatX    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better offX    documenting it.  Noting "this entry sometimes prints the 4th powerX    of a prime by mistake" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctlyX    working entry is best.XXXOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:XX    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  WeX    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor testsX    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as farX    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.XX    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:XX#define d defineX#d foo   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define fooXXint i;Xj;   <-- don't use such implicit type declarationXint k;XX    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If youX    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result inX    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.XX    Unfortunately, some ANSI C compilers require array indexes to be of       |X    integral type.  Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks should    |X    not be used in 1993.  This rule may be relaxed in future contests.      |XXint i;Xchar *c;Xi[c];   <--- use c[i] insteadX(i+3)["string"];   <--- use "string"[i+3] insteadXX    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number ofX    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide varietyX    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list areX    not portable and must not be used:XX* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variableX* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variableX* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list argX* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list argX* performing arithmetic on va_list variablesX* using va_list as a structure or unionXX    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.XX    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.XX    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While someX    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not.XX    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entriesX    must not assume that it returns an int.XX    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they doX    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that peopleX    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look forX    programs that are compact, and are instructional.XX    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.XX    We tend to dislike programs that:XX* are very hardware specificX* are very OS or Un*x version specificX     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specificX      code is likely not to be)X* dump core or have compiler warningsX     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)X* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*xX* abusing the build file to get around the size limitX* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphsX* are longer than they need to beX* are similar to previous winnersX* are identical to previous losers  :-)XX    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering theX    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your programX    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.XX    The build file should not be used to try and get around the sizeX    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out,X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order toX    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feelX    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better offX    if you show some amount of restraint.XX    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impactX    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to getX    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.XX    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blobX    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical CX    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a thirdX    version of the same program that is formatted in an interestingX    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!XX    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claimX    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicatingX    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)X    know of a smaller one!XX    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries thatX    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don'tX    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't dependX    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.XX    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries andX    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X clientX    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and theX    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyoneX    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  NotX    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (orX    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  BetterX    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.XX    X client entries should not to depend on particular items onX    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required linesX    in the ---remark--- section.XX    We like programs that:XX* are as concise and small as they need to beX* do something at least quasi-interestingX* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)X* are portableX* are unique or novel in their obfuscation styleX* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATIONX* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)XX    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, yourX    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in severalX    areas really does help.XX    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments inX    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had toX    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.XX    Be creative!XXXENTRY FORMAT:XX    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request yourX    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about theX    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)XX    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how toX    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning thatX    is found in mkentry.c:XXThis program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  EveryXattempt has been made to make sure that this program producesXan entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,Xwhere this program differs from the contest rules, theXcontest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with theXcontest rules before submitting an entry.XX    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to checkX    the entry against the size rules.XX    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints aboutX    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below)XX    The following is a sample entry:XX---entry---Xrule:1993Xfix:nXtitle:chonglabXentry:0Xdate:Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993Xhost:Un*x v6, pdp11/45X2.9BSD, pdp11/70X---remark---X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.XX    It is likely not to win a prize.

If this case applies, it would be be helpfulX    if you did one of the following:XX* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.XX* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:XXcc prog.c -o special_nameneed special binaryXX    or  rm -f special_src.cneed special sourceXcp prog.c special_src.cXcc special_src.c -o special_nameXX    or  rm -f special_buildneed special buildXtail +4 build > special_buildXsh < special_buildXX* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version ofX  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  YouX  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.XX    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoidX    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You shouldX    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  ThisX    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.XX    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  WeX    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If theX    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.XX    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode themX    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,X    then skip the ---info--- section.XX    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information thatX    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, anX    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sampleX    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include aX    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for aX    'hints' file.XX    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  ForX    example, info files may provide sample input or detailedX    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,X    the entry should not require them exist.XX    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid nameX    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,X    say so in the ---remark--- section.XX    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If theyX    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, sayX    so in the ---remark--- section.XX    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry hasX    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry shouldX    have entry number 0.XX    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entryX    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of theX    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren'tX    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in theX    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:XX...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges(not the address forXjudges@toad.com submitting entries)XX    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems referX    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that asX    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:XXThr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993XX    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  TheX    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On manyX    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:XXdate -u "+%a %h %d %T 19%y"Xdate -u | sed -e 's/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/'Xsh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e "s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/"'Xsh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e "s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/"'Xsh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e "s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/"'XX    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, setX    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'.X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry numberX    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to beX    replaced.XXXJUDGING PROCESS:XX    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.XX    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email messageX    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:XX---entry--- sectionXall ---author--- sectionsXall ---info--- sectionsX---build--- sectionX---program--- sectionXany other text, including the Email message headersXX    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sureX    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry wasX    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from theX    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process isX    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.XX    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particularX    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you areX    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of findingX    out in the end, who won and where they were from.XX    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make allX    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winningX    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not evenX    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCCX    winners at talks)XX    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to theX    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to giveX    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented theirX    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  WeX    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.XX    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that doesX    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in theX    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.XX    A reading consists of a number of actions:XX* reading the ---entry--- sectionX* reading the uudecoded ---build--- sectionX* reading the uudecoded ---program--- sectionX* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if anyX* passing the source thru the C pre-processorX    shipping over any #include filesX* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the sourceX* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processorX    shipping over any #include filesXX    In later rounds, other actions are performed:XX* linting the sourceX* compiling/building the sourceX* running the programX* performing misc tests on the source and binaryXX    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entriesX    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because itX    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to formX    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.X    An entry often will compete in several categories.XX    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entriesX    we receive.  A typical category list might be:XX* best small one line programX* best small programX* strangest/most creative source layoutX* most useful obfuscated programX* best game that is obfuscatedX* most creatively obfuscated programX* most deceptive C codeX* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)X* best abuse of ANSI CX* worst abuse of the rulesX* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>XX    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are soX    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.XX    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks ofX    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it intoX    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do notX    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, isX    less clear cut.XX    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat outX    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it isX    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entryX    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!XX    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), aX    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contestX    rules in some way.XX    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes suchX    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, theX    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.XXXANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:XX    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior toX    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.XX    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:XX    comp.lang.c  comp.unix.wizardsalt.sourcesXX    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the followingXX    comp.sources.d  alt.sources.dmisc.miscX    comp.sources.misc  comp.windows.xXX    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.

A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new itemto be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() (or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the newitem in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take careof rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that theWindow is mapped.The problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the windowis visible and mapped.  Do you know the best way to "tickle" a window sothat the expose event handler will be invoked to draw this new item?

What are the key ways of improving performance forPC (presumably Windows) clients?Also, what about async solutions?  (Yes, I appreciate that it will be *much* slower even with V.42bis.)  I'm in the process of installing PPP(with header compression).  How does that compare to cslip?  I've seena product called XRemote by NCD that promises to be pretty efficient, butare there comparable products out there?  If we're looking for efficiencyfor async, PC clients, what should we be looking at in addition to standardPPP w/ compression and XRemote?Any information would be greatly appreciated.  I'm still taking in allthe information in the faq, but any tips about the relative efficiencyof various product offerings would be great.  (I get the impressionthat discussions about speed are largely application specific, butthat not withstanding, any comments would be appreciated.)

There's really no simple way to tell this is the case.You can take xdm out of secure mode;  probably not too cool.You can wrap your call to XOpenDisplay in some code which solictsa future SIGALRM and longjmps past the XOpenDisplay from the signalhandler.

Look in:  mit/doc/extensions/mit-shm.ms  I found this invaluble. Unfortunately, there is a bit of work to set up the  shared memory segments, making an XImage from it, etc. Also, there is an  extension query to determine if the server supports it, but you still need to  test if the server is running on the same host and if shared memory is enabled  in the kernel. I have written layers of convience routines which make all this  transparent.  As for the XView code, well, I doubt that would be considered interesting.  The interesting stuff is done in a C object library. People interested in this  code can Email me.Regards,Richard Gooch,rgooch@atnf.csiro.au

The main problems we encountered were:1) Clients written with logic like the following:    if (DefaultDepth() != 1)/* Assume default depth is 8bit */   These clients need an 8bit deep visual in the root window   to run correctly.2) Other clients didn't even bother to do that much, and just   outright assumed they had a *dynamic* visual class, with a   dynamic colormap. XStoreColors doesn't work on cmaps   associated with Static or TrueColor visual classes, but   many clients don't bother to check, they just start   throwing XStoreColor calls at you.Though both are clearly client error, this is the case with so manyclients that it's easier for you to expose 8bit PseudoColor as adefault root window visual, than it ever would be for all these clientwriters to change their clients to do the right thing.--   -paulpmartz@dsd.es.comEvans & Sutherland

If you need speed, and your client can run on the same host as the X server,  you should use the shared memory extension to the sample X server (MIT-SHM).  xdpyinfo  will tell you if your server has this extension. This is certainly  available with the sample MIT X server running under SunOS.  A word of warning: make sure your kernel is configured to support shared  memory. And another word of warning: OpenWindows is slower than the MIT  server.  I have written an imaging tool (using XView for the GUI, by the way) which  yields over 10 frames per second for 512*512*8 bit images, running on a Sparc  IPC (half the cpu grunt of an IPX). This has proved quite sufficient for  animations.Regards,Richard Gooch....

Now, this is not so simple because some window managersslap a window over the root window that is the same size as the root window,so be sure to take that into account for further calculations.Calculate the position and width/height offsets for each window usingXGetGeometry().  BE SURE TO TAKE THE BORDER_WIDTH INTO CONSIDERATION.Remember a windows border_width IS ON THE OUTSIDE of a window, so thewindows x,y,width,height must be adjusted accordingly.All of this should give you pretty good numbers for how much space thewindow-manager is using.Now, to place the new window, you have to use the same numbers to calculate where you want to place it, because the window-manager will re-parent it onthe OUTSIDE of where you place your window (if I remember correctly).DISCLAIMER: All of this is from memory, and I no longer have the code.  ButI did get it working under several window managers correctly.  Feel free tocall or e-mail for further info.              -McGary-- Mike D.

Actually, it seems that this is more of a GCC question,because I got it to compile without trouble using cc on an RS/6000.Basically, there are a number of functions with prototypesset up in, let's say, CompositeP.h, for instance, the compositewidget's insert_child procedure is set up with the type :typedef void (*XtWidgetProc) (Widget)but in several places in the HP source code, they reference theinsert_child procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of justone, as the prototype suggests.  For example:(*superclass->composite_class.insert_child)(w, args, p_num_args)Now, GCC chokes on this, giving an error message that too many argumentsare passed to the function.  So, does anyone have any suggestions as tohow to turn off this checking in GCC, or how I can go about changing thecode to accomodate this call without changing /usr/include/X11/CompositeP.h,or has anyone successfully built the HP widget set and have any suggestions.Many thanks in advance for any help.--<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>Bill Woodward        | wpwood@austin.ibm.com   <-- Try this firstAIX Software Support | billw@aixwiz.austin.ibm.com  Graphics Group       | 512-838-2834I am the terror that flaps in the night.

An optionin the menu contained in the Xterm runs a Fortran subroutine that creatsa Tektronics-mode Xterm for displaying some graphics.  Typing a <RET> whilethe Tektronics-mode Xterm (future reference to this will be "Tek-term") isactive makes the Xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focusto the Xterm (I'm basing that statement on the fact that the border of the Tek-term stays the highlighted color and that the Tek-term stays on top ofXterm.  If what I'm describing isn't input focus, let me know.)  The xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it.Subsequent selections from the Xterm of the menu item that displays graphics highlihts the border and displays the updated graphics, but does not move the Tek-term to the top.  If the Tek-term has been iconized to conserve screen space, it stays an icon.The desired behavior: one of two options -     1. Whichever of the windows that is active is always on top of the        inactive one.    2. Whenever the Tek-term is inactivated, it should revert to a icon       but when it is activated it should become a window on a higher        level than the Xterm.What I think I need: a means of specifying that a Xterm or Tek-term willbe at the highest level and a way to iconify/expand a Xterm and Tek-term.These commands, would, I'd guess, need to be in the Fortran or in the command that starts up the Xterm and Tek-term.Other information: All this is taking place on a VT-1300 (a DEC dumb X-windows terminal) connected to a VAX running VMS and Motif.Thanks for your time.

If the XEvent arrive in this function as XEvent p_event;then, the value of p_event->xbutton.button is the button that was pressed. So, you just do a switch on that value in order to distinguish between them. In caseit was not clear p_event->xevent.button is an int. By the way, you mentioned the Button1MotionMask and if anyone can help me with these MotionMasks I would be grateful. I can not figure out how do distinguishbetween motions by which button is pressed as the motion is occurring. In essence I would like an seperate event-handler for motion with each button. Unfortunately, the XEvent sent by a MotionMask does not seem to contain the value of the pressed button.Any ideas,eps

This is a fact about an abstract modelof what the GUI users are doing, not about what they actually *are* doing.This abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a *programmer*of the system. (NB: some users may see it, too, but only when they putaside the work at hand and start thinking like a programmer.)I'm not saying that the programmer's perspective is evil or stunted. Afterall, that's what I do, too! I am saying that UI designers must carefullydistinguish between the user/programmer conceptual models, and they mustultimately serve the user of the system, not the builder of the system.    I don't recall the actual stats, but something like 1 in 5 people can be   categorized as a "symbol manipulator".It would be interesting to know more about the meaning and basis for thisclaim. At any rate, I don't think this is evidence that 20% of users thinklike programmers. Bankers, financial analysts, structural engineers ---these are all people whose work you could characterize as primarily symbolmanipulation. But what they do is not programming, and programming is notrequired to do what they do. To restate my previous point: yes, users want to build their own solutions;no, they do not want to do programming to accomplish this.

Doing so is cumbersome andtime-consuming.Therefore, I have implemented f.squeeze{ left, center, right }functions in my own copy of vtwm; the idea being that with one clickof a button, you can change this:    +---------+    + title A +    +------------------------+    +   this is the          +    +     body of the        +    +      window, window A  +    +------------------------+to this:                   +---------+                   + title A +    +------------------------+    +   this is the          +    +     body of the        +    +      window, window A  +    +------------------------+ ===============Okay.

What is and how can I implement drag and drop?----------------------------------------------------------------------0.  Xt Glossary----------------------------------------------------------------------o The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code  to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with  this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,  RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,  etc.  The terms "Xt" and "Intrinsics" are used interchangeably,  however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X  window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,  Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the  Intrinsics are not especially useful.o A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The  precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It  is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the  Object class although these are more accurately called windowless  widgets or gadgets.o Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below  the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib  functions because Xt provides most such services although an  understanding of Xlib helps with problems.----------------------------------------------------------------------1.

Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads?----------------------------------------------------------------------In brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion forcritical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one ofthe above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all theappropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of alist traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out thatbehavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler callsany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problemspecific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions otherfunctions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed thatthese functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.The only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in theinterrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by awork procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add eitherof these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerousto add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectivelypreempts any work procedures previously added and so they will neverbe called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loopabout the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handlercan write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal.However, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.Why don't the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because itis supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operatingsystem.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don't think so.        Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'ReillyVolume 6 are in error.----------------------------------------------------------------------4.  How do I use a different visual than the default?----------------------------------------------------------------------This requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window hasthree things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap andborder pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmapresource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questionsdeals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of theseresources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In theshell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreenand DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources isnot properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window iscreated.  They are not properly set because each of the values dependson the visual being used.  How to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  Thefirst is if you want an application to start with a particular visualand the second is if you want a particular shell within an applicationto start with a different visual.  The second is actually easierbecause the basic information you need is available.  The first is alittle harder because you'll need to initialize much of the toolkityourself in order to determine the needed information./* * Some sample code to start up an application using something other * than the default visual. * * To compile: *cc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm * * To run: *./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow * * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap * to install. */#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>#include <X11/StringDefs.h>#include <X11/Shell.h>typedef struct{Visual*visual;intdepth;} OptionsRec;OptionsRecOptions;XtResource resources[] ={{"visual", "Visual", XtRVisual, sizeof (Visual *),XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, visual), XtRImmediate, NULL},{"depth", "Depth", XtRInt, sizeof (int),XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, depth), XtRImmediate, NULL},};XrmOptionDescRec Desc[] ={{"-visual", "*visual", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL},{"-depth", "*depth", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL}};intmain (argc, argv)intargc;char**argv;{XtAppContextapp;/* the application context */Widgettop;/* toplevel widget */Display*dpy;/* display */char**xargv;/* saved argument vector */intxargc;/* saved argument count */Colormapcolormap;/* created colormap */XVisualInfovinfo;/* template for find visual */XVisualInfo*vinfo_list;/* returned list of visuals */intcount;/* number of matchs (only 1?) */Argargs[10];Cardinalcnt;char*name = "test";char*class = "Test";/* * save the command line arguments */xargc = argc;xargv = (char **) XtMalloc (argc * sizeof (char *));bcopy ((char *) argv, (char *) xargv, argc * sizeof (char *));/* * The following creates a _dummy_ toplevel widget so we can * retrieve the appropriate visual resource. */cnt = 0;top = XtAppInitialize (&app, class, Desc, XtNumber (Desc), &argc, argv,       (String *) NULL, args, cnt);dpy = XtDisplay (top);cnt = 0;XtGetApplicationResources (top, &Options, resources,   XtNumber (resources),   args, cnt);cnt = 0;if (Options.visual && Options.visual != DefaultVisualOfScreen (XtScreen (top))){XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNvisual, Options.visual); ++cnt;/* * Now we create an appropriate colormap.

Which visual should an application use?----------------------------------------------------------------------This is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there isno way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has tobe specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then yourapplication probably falls into the category of always using thedefault visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particularvisual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or somesuch).Why?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a serverallocates resources I may not always want your application to run inTrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I maybe very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColoror just monochrome.As an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many differentpossible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, staticcolor, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris's offer all the above plus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.----------------------------------------------------------------------6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual?----------------------------------------------------------------------This is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrarywidget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for theshell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of thatshell.A widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must haveits own realize method to use the visual when it callsXCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can beobtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  Areasonable value is probably XtNvisual.----------------------------------------------------------------------7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit?----------------------------------------------------------------------The default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  Thisis interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen()and the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e.it is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.If the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copiescolormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as thevisual.----------------------------------------------------------------------8.  I've done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why?----------------------------------------------------------------------Some resource converters improperly cache references.  This wasespecially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.----------------------------------------------------------------------9.  Why doesn't my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()?----------------------------------------------------------------------See section 2.8 of the Xt specification.It eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  TheIntrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and allof its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed.It is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way anypending X events or further references to that widget can be cleanedup before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is thenperformed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions havecompleted, before checking for the next X event.  At this point thelist is traversed and each widget's memory is actually free()'d, amongother things.As some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if theIntrinsics determine that they have no further references to thewidgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occursimmediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed onthe destroy list before entering the inner event loop are notdestroyed until returning to the outer event loop.----------------------------------------------------------------------10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks?----------------------------------------------------------------------The problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exitingan application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widgetmay not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as opensockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code forsimplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):WidgetToplevelGet (gw)Widgetgw;/* widget to find toplevel */{Widgettop;for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))/* empty */;return (top);}voidExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)Widgetgw;/* widget */XtPointerclosure;/* data the app specified */XtPointercall_data;/* widget specific data */{Widgettoplevel;toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);XtUnmapWidget (toplevel);/* make it disappear quickly */XtDestroyWidget (toplevel);exit (0);}One can see that the above code exit's immediately after destroyingthe toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may neveroccur.  This works for most widgets and most applications but will not workfor those widgets that have any external state.  You might think thatsince it works now it will always work but remember that part of thereason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorantof the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that thewidget may change and someday require that some external state iscleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.One alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag andthen test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, privateevent loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, anddifficult to maintain practices.Try the following code instead.#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>extern Widget ToplevelGet (#if NeedFunctionPrototypesWidgetgw#endif);extern Boolean ExitWorkProc (#if NeedFunctionPrototypesXtPointerclosure#endif);extern void ExitCallback (#if NeedFunctionPrototypesWidgetgw,XtPointerclosure,XtPointercall_data#endif);WidgetToplevelGet (gw)Widgetgw;/* widget to find toplevel */{Widgettop;for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))/* empty */;return (top);}voidExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)Widgetgw;/* widget */XtPointerclosure;/* data the app specified */XtPointercall_data;/* widget specific data */{Widgettoplevel;toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);XtUnmapWidget (toplevel);/* make it disappear quickly */XtDestroyWidget (toplevel);XtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw),  ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL);}BooleanExitWorkProc (closure)XtPointerclosure;{exit (0);/*NOTREACHED*/}ExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when theapplication is next idle -- which happens after all the events areprocessed and the destroy callbacks are executed.----------------------------------------------------------------------11. How do I resize a Shell widget?----------------------------------------------------------------------After it is realized, one doesn't resize a Shell widget.  The properthing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widgetusing XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to theShell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow therequest.  However, the Shell must have the resourceXtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask thewindow manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.To change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, notthe child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.----------------------------------------------------------------------12. Why can't XtAppAddInput() handle files?----------------------------------------------------------------------It does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file doesnot fit most peoples' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a filedescriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would notblock, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not toblock.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  Fora file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF-- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics alwayscalls the input handler because it always thinks something is about tobe read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV basedOS's it is the poll() system call.How to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to useanother process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipeto connect the application with this other process and pass the filedescriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program onBSD systems is "tail -f filename".It's rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_reliable.  In particular:- IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while  (several thousand times) and then stop until some other  event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race  condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.- Pyramid, doesn't work at all.- Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as  sockets), wasn't completely broken, but although the writing  side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it  all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at  a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks  (get raound it by detecting the situation and having  select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had  been given the whole block).Note that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such asread(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area andmay not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designersfelt it was a common enough operation that it should be included withpart of the toolkit.  Why they didn't also deal with signals at thispoint I don't know.----------------------------------------------------------------------13. What good books and magazines are there on Xt?----------------------------------------------------------------------I have a favorite that is the definitive reference.  To my perspectiveit offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the fulldetails of the Intrinsics.  When I started using it I was alreadyfamiliar with Xt and the concepts behind it, so newcomers may or maynot find it useful.  I've always found it accurate and complete, whichmeans its a 1000 pages.Asente, Paul J., and Swick, Ralph R., "X Window System Toolkit, TheComplete Programmer's Guide and Specification", Digital Press,1990, ISBN 1-55558-051-3, order number EY-E757E-DP; and byPrentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-972191-6.

"The X Window System: Applications and Programming withXt (Motif Version)," Prentice Hall, 1989 (ISBN 0-13-497074-8).(ISBN 0-13-972167-3)And of course O'Reilly has an entire series of manuals on X and Xt.O'Reilly ordering is 800-998-9938.  In particular, Volume 5 is an Xtreference done in manual page style.  The 3rd edition is extensivelyoverhauled and goes far beyond the MIT manual pages.  I'm finding itvery useful.  In particular, the permutted index and references toother manual pages help a great deal in chasing down relatedinformation.I read two periodicals, "The X Resource" and the "The X Journal".These are the only two dealing specifically with X.  "The X Resource"is published quarterly, by O'Reilly, with one of the issues being theMIT X Consortium Technical Conference Proceedings.  There is noadvertising.

What Widgets are available?----------------------------------------------------------------------There are three popular widget sets:Athena- The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most  purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently, a 3d look is  available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z.Motif- From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on  many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but  Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think  it is poorly implemented.OLIT- The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets  implementing Sun's Open Look specification.  Developed by  AT&T.  I've never used it so can't comment on its quality.  I've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.In addition the following collection of widgets are also available:Xtra- a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software  Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph, stacked  bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help,  spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets.  I've never seen  them so I can't comment.FWF- The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of  freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor,  FileDialog, and a few others.  The current set of widgets  can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine  a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z.Xcu- The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the  early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for  buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so  widely used.Xs- The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but  seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise.Xw- The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written  for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5.  Again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died.  The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was  originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided  much experience for the designers of Xt.Xo- A widget set I'm working on.  It's still primitive but you  can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/Xo/*The following specialized widgets are also available:Tbl- Implements a tabular layout of widgets.  Supports Motif  widgets as children.  Part of Wcl.Plots- The Athena Plotting widgets (not the Athena widgets).

What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there?----------------------------------------------------------------------__________________________________________NameLanguageVendor__________________________________________XviewCSunOIC++ParcPlaceInterviewsC++StanfordTcl/tkCsprite.berkeley.edu__________________________________________However much I like C and admire the skill in both designing andimplementing the Intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will developin the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language.  Keepyour eyes open and expect some change about the same time a languageother than C _starts_ gaining acceptance.----------------------------------------------------------------------16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues?----------------------------------------------------------------------First, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially)typdef struct{    Stringname;    longvalue;} Arg;and the code:Argarg;XtSetArg (arg, "name", 3.2)expands toArgarg;arg.name = "name";arg.value = 3.2;you can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.valuegets the integer "3" instead of the floating point value "3.2".  Whenthe value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern iswildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So,how to get around this?The following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am nowrecomending it over the previous suggestions.#define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \\    if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \\        XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \\    } else { \\        XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \\        XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \\    }----------------------------------------------------------------------17. How do I write a resource converter?----------------------------------------------------------------------Courtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com):The following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5)Intrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allowfor destructors and caching of converted values.There are several main types of resource converters:    string to data type    data type to string    data type to data typei) string to data type    Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings    that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often    used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:NameValue"True"1"False"0    In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare    the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most    readily accomplished by the use of the "quark" mechanism of the    resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,    which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a    single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the    quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.    If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many    converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then    a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the    resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of    these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks    and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one    of the converters.ii) data type to string    This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data    type converters since the use of quarks isn't necessary.  Instead,    the data type value is simply converted to a string value,    probably by the use of sprintf.    Data type to string converters are useful for applications that    wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that    they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This    mechanism can be used to provide a "snapshot" of application state    into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to    a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.    If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type    converter, it isn't much extra effort to write the data type to    string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure    that they are consistent.iii) data type to data type    This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type    value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be    converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for    red, green and blue.The type signature for a resource converter is as follows:typedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *,XrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);    Display *dpy;    XrmValuePtr args;    Cardinal *num_args;    XrmValuePtr fromVal;    XrmValuePtr toVal;    XtPointer *converter_data;When the converter is invoked, the "fromVal" argument points to the sourceX resource manager value and the "toVal" argument points to thedestination X resource manager value.  The "converter_data" argumentis an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specifiedwhen the converter is registered.  The "args" and "num_args" argumentsallow extra information to be passed to the converter when it isinvoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussedabove would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup thePixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.Care must be taken with the "toVal" argument.  An XrmValue has thefollowing type definition and specifies a size and location for aconverted value:typedef struct {    unsigned int    size;    caddr_t         addr;} XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;When the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location ofthe given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL.In the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of thedestination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  Ifthe destination area is not large enough, then the converter shouldset the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  Thecaller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke theconverter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simplycopy the converted value into the space given and return True.If the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location tothe address of a static variable containing the converted value andreturn True.When writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and itbecomes convenient to define a macro:    #define DONE(var, type) \\      if (toVal->addr) \\{ \\  if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \\    { \\      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\      return False; \\    } \\  else \\    *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \\} \\      else \\toVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \\      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\      return True;    #define DONESTR(str) \\      if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \\{ \\  toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\  return False; \\} \\      else \\toVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \\      toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\      return True;Inside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safetychecking on the "num_args" and "args" arguments to ensure that yourconverter is being called properly.Once you have written your converter, you need to register it with theIntrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creatingwidgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.To register a converter with a single application context, useXtAppSetTypeConverter:void XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args,cache, destructor)    XtAppContext context;    String from;    String to;    XtTypeConverter converter;    XtConvertArgList args;    Cardinal num_args;    XtCacheType cache;    XtDestructor destructor;To register a converter with all application contexts, useXtSetTypeConverter:void XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args,cache, destructor)    String from;    String to;    XtTypeConverter converter;    XtConvertArgList args;    Cardinal num_args;    XtCacheType cache;    XtDestructor destructor;In the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter andXtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverterand XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should beused.When a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a "cache" argumentspecifies how converted resource values are to be cached:    XtCacheNoneDon't cache any converted values    XtCacheAllCache all converted values    XtCacheByDisplayCache converted values on a per display basisCaching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is agood idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).The "destructor" argument is a routine that is invoked then theresource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count hasbeen decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value isbeing destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition:typedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer,XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);    XtAppContext context;    XrmValuePtr to;    XtPointer converter_data;    XrmValuePtr args;    Cardinal *num_args;The destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associatedwith the "to" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointedto by the "to" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passedthe extra arguments that were passed to the converter when theconversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual argumentsfor the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need tofree the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the privatedata passed in when the converter was registered.Sample converter code can be found in the following files in the MITR5 distribution:    mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h----------------------------------------------------------------------18. How do I open multiple displays?----------------------------------------------------------------------See "Multi-user Application Software Using Xt", The X Resource, Issue 3,(Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issuesinvolved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In anutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_application context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each displayand remove it from the application context.The real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This canhappen 3 ways:1. User selects a "quit" button on one of the displays,2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message,3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message,   server shutdown/crash, or network failure.I'll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ aproblem of translating a Widget to a display and removing thatdisplay.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.The third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on theOliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficultproblem.The difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/Oerror is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially truefor a single display X based application, but not true for amultiple display program or an application that does things other thandisplay information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs theI/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit()happens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoidreturning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragmentdemonstrates this:#include <setjmp.h>jmp_buf XIOrecover;voidXIOHandler (dpy)Display*dpy;{destroyDisplay (dpy);longjmp (XIOrecover, 1);}main (){...if (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0)XSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler);XtAppMainLoop (app_context);}The destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can goback to the application specific data and perform any necessarycleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().For those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() isfirst called it returns a 0 and save's enough information in thejmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program tothe same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return valueof this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument tolongjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for thispurpose it is adequate.Some other problems you might run into are resource converters thatimproperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errorssuch as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with thetotal number of displays you can open since typically only a limitednumber of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typicalvalue.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying toconnect to a display.There was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic inNovember of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basicallysaid this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change.----------------------------------------------------------------------19. What changed from R3 to R4 to R5?----------------------------------------------------------------------This addresses only changes in the Intrinsics.  First, the generalchanges for each release are described.  Then a, certainly incomplete,list of new functions added and others that are now deprecated arelisted.  Brevity is a primary goal.Much of the following information is retrieved from Chapter 13 of the MITXt Intrinsics Manual and from O'Reilly Volume 5, 3rd edition.From R3 to R4- Addition of gadgets (windowless widgets)- New resource type converter interface to handle cacheing and  additional  data.- Variable argument list interface.- #define XtSpecificationRelease 4  (added with this release)- WMShellPart, TopLevelShellPart & TransientShellPart changed  incompatibly.- core.initialize, core.set_values added ArgList and count parameters- event handlers had continue_to_dispatch parameter added- core.set_values_almost specification changed.- core.compress_exposure changed to an enumerated data type from Boolean- core.class_inited changed to enumerated data type from Boolean- constraint.get_values_hook added to extension record- core.initialize_hook obsolete as info is passed to core.initialize- shell.root_geometry_manager added to extension record- core.set_values_hook obsolete as info is passed to core.set_values- Calling XtQueryGeometry() must store complete geometry.- Added UnrealizeCallback.- XtTranslateCoords() actually works under R4.From R4 to R5:- Psuedo resource baseTranslation added.- Searching for app-default, and other files, made more flexible- customization resource added.- Per-screen resource database.- Support permanently allocated strings.- Permanetly allocated strings required for several class fields.- The args argument to XtAppInitialize, XtVaAppInitialize,  XtOpenDisplay, XtDisplayInitialize, and XtInitialize were changed  from Cardinal* to int*- Many performance improvements (this is summarized from the article  "Xt Performance Improvements in Release 5" by Gabe Beged-Dov in "The  X Resource", Issue 3):- XrmStringToQuark() augmented with XrmPermStringToQuark() to  avoid string copies.

Where are the resources loaded from?----------------------------------------------------------------------The resources of a widget are filled in from the following places(from highest priority to lowest priority):1. Args passed at creation time.2. Command line arguments.3. User's per host defaults file4. User's defaults file.5. User's per application default file.6. System wide per application default file.Note that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The resultof steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.The per host defaults file contains customizations for allapplications executing on a specific computer.  This file is eitherspecified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is notset then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.The user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGERproperty on the root window of the display or if that is not set thenthe file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program "xrdb" isused to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that thisshould be kept relatively small as each client that connects to thedisplay must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte isreasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGERbut most do not.A user may have many per application default files containingcustomizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quiteflexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describesthe various environment variables and how they effect where this fileis found.The system wide per application default files are typically found in/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then thefallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on howthis file is found.  Read the next part that describes the variousenvironment variables and how they effect where this file is found.[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]You can use several environment variables to control how resources areloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH,XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variablescontrol where Xt looks for application-defaults files as anapplication is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults filefrom the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the pathdefined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such away that app-defaults files appear in several different directoryhierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's OpenWindows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this forXFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults filesin both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever yourOPENWINHOME is located):setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%NThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list ofpathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows(see XtResolvePathname()):%NThe value of the filename parameter, or theapplication's class name.%TThe value of the file "type".  In this case, theliteral string "app-defaults"%Ccustomization resource (R5 only)%SSuffix.  None for app-defaults.%LLanguage, locale, and codeset (e.g. "ja_JP.EUC")%lLanguage part of %L  (e.g. "ja")%tThe territory part of the display's language string%cThe codeset part of the display's language stringLet's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is"Myterm". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin.(Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/MytermAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the aboveapp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, itreads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect ofthis path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.Let's consider another example. This time, let's setXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the currentworking directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%NThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expandsto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting fordebugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming theapp-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, soyou can run the application from the directory in which you areworking and still have the resources loaded properly.NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,      for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is      defined so %T and %S are useless.With R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customizationresource value.  For example, you might run the "myterm" applicationlike this:myterm -xrm "*customization: -color"If one of your pathname specifications had the value"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C" then the expanded pathname would be"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color" because the %C substitutioncharacter takes on the value of the customization resource.The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\     (R5)/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in thisbatch of default settings.)The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is <root>/%L/%N%C:\\  (R5)<root>/%l/%N%C:\\  (R5)<root>/%N%C:\\     (R5)<root>/%L/%N:\\<root>/%l/%N:\\<root>/%N:<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directoryif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to somevalue other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application findyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to setXAPPLRESDIR to ".", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery workeddifferently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIRvalue to "./", a dot followed by a slash.----------------------------------------------------------------------21. What order are callbacks executed in?----------------------------------------------------------------------(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)The Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is becauseboth the widget writer and the application writer have the ability tomodify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither onecurrently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannotguarantee the order of execution.The application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; thewidget writer is not required to document when the widget will add andremove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have;therefore the functionality contained in a callback should beindependent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on thelist.Even though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallbacksays: "callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the procedure is to be appended." you may not infer from the word "appended" that the callback routinesare called in the same order as they have been added to the callbacklist.----------------------------------------------------------------------22. How do I know if a widget is visible?----------------------------------------------------------------------(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)> I am building a widget needs to know if it is visible. I set the visible> interest field in Core and if my window is completely obscured, the Core> visible flag goes FALSE. However, if my window is iconified, the flag> stays set to TRUE.Right, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a "deficiency"in the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of theprotocol.  (The "deficiency" is that the information is available in one way,in this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, inthe second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this sectioncarefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.A VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes fromviewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped;that is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency.Visibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol;see the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.> Is this a problem with "mwm" or is there something> else which needs to be done?You'll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.> If the problem is "mwm", what is the fastest> way to determine if a window is iconified? As an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an actionroutine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widgetwhich contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see themap_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These aresuggestions.----------------------------------------------------------------------23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()?----------------------------------------------------------------------You can't.----------------------------------------------------------------------24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc?----------------------------------------------------------------------Unfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc()tends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it ishandled something like:ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type))if (!ptr){perror ("malloc in xyzzy()");exit (1)}To handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functionsXtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() whichall use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() andrealloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xterror handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.In addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it usesXtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like:if (!ptr)ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type));elseptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1));++count;to be written as:ptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);Also, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I'vefound the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I'mallocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions soI can fully recover from not enough memory errors.XtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating astructure or copying a string:  struct abc *xyzzy;  char     *ptr;  char     *str = "abcdef";  xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc);/* takes care of type casting */  ptr = XtNewString (str);A strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow animplementation to provide functions that are not exchangable withmalloc() and free().  I.e. code such as: char      *ptr; ptr = XtMalloc (100); /* ... */ free (ptr);may not work.  Personally, I'd call any implementation that did thisbroken and complain to the vendor.A common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a stringwhen they should really be using XmStringFree().----------------------------------------------------------------------25. How to debug an Xt application?----------------------------------------------------------------------First, I'd recomend getting "purify" from Pure Software.  This is agreat package for tracing memory problems on Sun's.  It's a bit priceyat $2750 but I'd still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb(contact support@pure.com for more info).Purify inserts additional checking instructions directly intothe object code produced by existing compilers.  Theseinstructions check every memory read and write performed bythe program under test and detect several types of accesserrors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing pastmalloc'd bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify insertschecking logic into all of the code in a program, includingthird party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifiessystem call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memoryusage and identifies individual memory leaks using a noveladaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify's nearlycomprehensive memory access checking slows the target programdown typically by a factor of two to five.An alternative package that isn't as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs onmany Unix's and has pretty similar features is "The SENTINEL DebuggingEnvironment".  This replaces malloc() and several other C libraryfunctions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.comfor more info)Next, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you'll need to run insynchronous mode, easily accomplished with the "-sync" command lineargument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Thenset a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to theoriginal Xlib function being called.  If you don't run in synchronousmode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls toXlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from theserver are asynchronous.Next, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use theundocumented resource "xtIdentifyWindows" or the class resource"XtDebug" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window.For example:    example% xload -xrm '*XtDebug:true' &    example% xwininfo -tree     <click in new xload window>will give the normal information but the widget name and class of eachwindow is included.  This can help for checking the location and sizeof errant widgets.Next, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want totest the way a widget manages it's children, you can tryexport.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filterbetween any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviourof both.  It's a very clever idea.The most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while theapplication is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as froma pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you'll need togo to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The serverlocks up because the application being debugged has said no one elsecan have access to the keyboard but the application is not stoppedwaiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands.Unfortunately you can't give them because all the input is going toyour application which is stopped.The best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines onyour desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment)on one machine, and running the application on the other, possiblyusing a command sequence like this:othermachine% xhost +thismachinethismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0;thismachine% gdb application# Your favorite debugger.or this:othermachine% xhost +thismachinethismachine% gdb application(gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0(gdb) run ...I believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a methodof dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions torelease any grabs during breakpoints.Debugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills andknowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowingthe internals of a particular widget but not very far withoutunderstanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditionalbreakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a greatdeal.----------------------------------------------------------------------26. Why don't XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work?----------------------------------------------------------------------   I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,   XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when   I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.   I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works   perfect, but in my "real" application nothing happens. The introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted thoseroutines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens isthey use a default application context different then the one you mayhave created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a perapplication context basis and you are using two application contexts,you won't get those events.For example:...cnt = 0;toplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class,   Desc, XtNumber (Desc),   &argc, argv,   Fallback, args, cnt);XtAddTimeOut (...)XtAddWorkProc (...)XtAppMainLoop (app)would never invoke the timeout.----------------------------------------------------------------------27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop?----------------------------------------------------------------------(Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)Drag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an``intuitive'' fashion.Motif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook hassupported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable witheach other, and so far as I know, they are not published.I wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible publicprotocol for doing drag 'n drop operations between clients.  Myintention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people tosupport a "standard" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they developand contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as longas it is based on Xt).The implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCMconventions, for more details read the code.I have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel thatit works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also, there seem tobe many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motifanyway.The latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp fromnetcom.com, in /pub/rogerr.

My computer configuration with the X problem is as follows:       486DX50/256/16RAM  running Esix 4.0.4        Wangtek AT-style interface 250 M tape drive.       I have loaded the Basic OS (which includes nsu) and       inet utilities (tcp/ip).       I ftp-ed the XFree86 (X11R5) binaries and installed properly.  I can execute startx and run X-windows with no problems. However, if I try to access the tape drive while in X, the machine locks up instantly.  If I am out of X and access the tape, the tape drive works fine.  Soon as I try to startx again; the screen changes modes, but, the grey background pattern does not come up and no xterm is forked.  I have to login from another terminal and execute a shutdown to reset the system. I've contacted Esix about this problem.  They claim THEIR X-window X11R4 server (which I have) works with the Wangtek tape drive.  They also  claim I only need the nsu (network system utilities) to run X; I don't need inet (tcp/ip).  My experience has been that I need BOTH to get XFree86 to work.  I'm not too concerned about having to load both nsu and inet packages to get X to work unless the inet package is causing my problem. I would like to get both X and my tape drive to co-exist on the same system.  If you can shed any light on the problem, it would be appreciated.  One colleague implied this might be a hardware conflict.  If this is true, what direction should I look to resolve the conflict ?

The ability to program was>an entry requirement.At Robert Gordon University, programming was the main (most time-consuming) start of the course. The first two years consisted of five subjects:Software Engineering (Pascal/C/UNIX), Computer Engineering (6502/6809/68000 assembler), Computer Theory (LISP/Prolog), Mathematics/Statistics and Communication Skills (How to pass interviews/intelligence tests and groupdiscussions e.g. How to survive a helicopter crash in the North Sea).The third year (Industrial placement) was spent working for a computer company for a year. The company could be anywhere in Europe (there was a special Travel Allowance Scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors).  The fourth year included Operating Systems(C/Modula-2), Software Engineering (C/8086 assembler), Real Time Laboratory (C/68000 assembler) and Computing Theory (LISP).  There were also Group Projects in 2nd and 4th Years, where students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an outside company (the only disadvantage being that specifications would change suddenly). In the first four years, there was a 50%:50% weighting between courseworks and exams for most subjects. However in the Honours year, this was reduced to a 30%:70% split between an Individual Project and final exams (no coursework assessment) - are all Computer Science courses like this?BTW - we started off with 22 students in our first year and were left with 8 byHonours year. Also, every course is tutored separately. Not easy tryingto sleep when you are in 8 student class :-). Cheers,  Michael -- | Michael S. A.

Looking through the sourcefor XDM from X11R5 that I have here, it seems that the bare bones code isthere but not completely there.##My first inclination is that XDM is not your typical X client.

By default only the last change can be undone, but a resource is    provided to allow the user to specify how many, including unlimited,    levels of undo information should be kept. Also, undo of undo is    supported.There is no truth in the rumour that the next version will be EmaXe 19 :-)                          -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-For those who have not encountered aXe before here is a summary ofwhat it is all about:aXe is a simple to use text editor for X that represents a significantimprovement over xedit. Also built around the Athena Text Widget itfeatures, amongst other things,   o multiple windows   o multiple buffers   o default menu interface   o optional button interface, with choice and layout of buttons      under user control   o minibuffer for expert use and access to external filters   o provision for defining a keyboard macro   o geometry specification and resizing in terms of characters   o file selection via a browser   o knowledge of line numbers   o parenthesis matching   o regular expression searching   o restricted or unlimited undo   o ability to change font   o easy entry of control codes   o xterm-like keymap feature   o easy runtime setting of selected preferences (resources)   o both brief and comprehensive on-line help   o server mode with cooperating client programs   o optional extension language using Tcl   o optional Xaw3d widget set compatability   o collection of reusable widgets that embody the functionality of aXeI have personally built and run core aXe, i.e. without the Tcl andXaw3d options, on the following systems:   Sun SPARC        SunOS 4.1.x     MIT X11R5   Sun SPARC        SunOS 5.1       MIT X11R5   Encore Multimax  UMAX 4.3        MIT X11R5   DEC 5000/120     ULTRIX 4.2      MIT X11R5   HP 9000/710      HP-UX 8.07      MIT X11R5   MAC IIci         AU/X 3.0        MIT X11R5   but not all have been subject to the same level of testing. I haveonly tested the Tcl and Xaw3d options on the first.A number of '#ifdef SYSV'-isms that have been fed back to me have beenincorporated into the code and a possible scandir replacement isprovided for those systems that do not have one.Although aXe will probably build under R4 run-time problems have beenencountered in the past. I have not bothered to try this version underR4, and have not put any effort into solving previously knownproblems.  Therefore, if you are at R4 you very much take pot luck. Ifit doesn't work the only alternative is to try the last release,2.1.1, of version 2 which should still be around. It doesn't have asmany features and uses the Widget Creation Library (Wcl). Not onlythat, it requires an old version of Wcl, 1.06 or 1.05. Version 3 ofaXe was nearing completion when version 2 of Wcl came out so aXe 2never got converted to make use of it.aXe is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12)and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1) initially, and probably in duecourse from several other ftp sites.

When X11R5 is startedon it any console messages during startup are undeletable.  After X is fullystarted we run an xterm as the "console" - the problem is that any messagesthat arrive before this starts go to the plain console.  "Refresh window" failsto remove them.  The messages are a real pain since they sit in the middle ofthe screen obscuring anything else below them.At boot time the 3/60 lists two framebuffers  -  /dev/cgfour0 and /dev/bwtwo1.We're running X in color, and I suspect that maybe the offending messages areon the B/W framebuffer, and thereby not getting deleted.My question is: has anyone else seen this, and is there an easy way to get ridof these messages?Please reply by e-mail to hughm@inmos.co.uk.Hugh McIntyre.INMOS Ltd., Bristol, UK.(BTW: SunOS 4.0.3, X11R5, mwm).PS: I know I can redirect output of the relevant commands to /dev/null - I'm    looking for a more general solution).

Idecided to implement an animated cursor (using 6 created cursors) by callingXDefineCursor from a SIG_ALRM signal handler. This is used to indicate we arewaiting for a operator request to complete. (on a production control system).I was redrawing the screen underneath the animated cursor and then restoringthe standard cursor when complete. I found dumped core , and upon analysisit was when the SIG_ALRM handler was called during a XDrawString call. XDrawStringwas doing a bcopy (presumably an internal structure) when the XDefineCursorwas called. Presumably the (internal) structure that XDrawString was manipulatingwas not in a stable state and sent XDefineCursor to where it shouldn't have been.Has anyone else experienced this? Is there any official documentation thatsays you should ensure this doesn't happen? Or should bcopy() be atomic.We are running on SGI Irix 4.0.1 with X11R4.-- Regards, Martin   /\\/\\     :  Martin Visser - Electrical / Software Engineer   / / /\\    :  Engineering Technology Department / / /  \\   :  BHP Steel - Slab and Plate Products Division/ / / /\\ \\  :  P.O.

I tried to start a discussion in `comp.windows.x' at the start of the  year about some sort of `standard color table' that icons should follow  (say 16 to 32 colors including 5 colors for a small grey scale). but no  one responded at all.    The problem is that if the colors for icons are just used willy-nilly  you will soon find that the workstations color table, devotes itself  solely the window manager, icons and other `adminstrative tasks' instead  of applications that actually require the colors for proper working.  ``Color needful applications'' such as :  Picture and graphic displayers,  Animation, Real Time video, Raytracers, etc... .    The following is a suggested color table for icons, and general use.  Icons, Window Managers, and general applications, should follow this  table or something like it, UNLESS the application is ``color needful''.     * for each primary color (red,green,blue) three colors             EG: values   0, 128 and 255.       This results in  3 ^ 3  colors (27) representing most of the       standard colors for use in icons.     * two extra shades of grey             EG: vales    (black) 0, 64, 128, 196 and 255 (white,red,...)     * 3 other colors -- probably of some primary color to provide shading       a and 3-D look to buttons and titlebars in the window manager.    This table represents 32 colors and represents a large range of  posibilities for the above ``administrative services'' of the  workstation.

To accomodate AIX version 3.2, we have created a patch tothe sources.  The patch and accompanying instructions for itsapplication can be retrieved at no charge via anonymous-ftp from theinternet host emsworth.andrew.cmu.edu (128.2.45.40) in the directory./aixpatch.  For those without internet access, a 3.5" diskette can beordered for $10 by sending, or faxing, a purchase order to the addressbelow. The base 5.1 system can be ordered from us as a CDrom or ftp'ed from thesame host.Note that this patch adds no additional functionality but simply allowsAUIS to compile under AIX3.2.-----------The Andrew User Interface System (AUIS) is a comprehensive environmenton top of X11 windows in which you can create, use, and mail multi-mediaapplications and documents.   A major advantage of AUIS is thecapability to recursively embed objects.  Thus, one can edit text thatnot only contains multiple fonts, indentation, and other typography, butalso  contains embedded raster images, spreadsheets, drawing editors,equations, simple animations, and so on. These embedded objects canthemselves contain other objects, including text.AUIS has three components:    The Andrew User Environment is an integrated and extensible set    of applications beginning with the ez text editor, a help    system, a system monitoring tool, an editor-based shell    interface, and other editors corresponding to the various    available types of objects.     The Andrew Toolkit (ATK) is a portable, object-oriented    user-interface toolkit that provides the architecture wherein    objects can be embedded in one-another.  With the toolkit,    programmers can create new objects that can be embedded as    easily as those that come with the system.     The Andrew Message System (AMS) provides a multi-media interface    to mail and bulletin-boards.  AMS supports several mail    management strategies and implements many advanced  features    including authentication, return receipts, automatic sorting of    mail, vote collection and tabulation, enclosures, audit trails    of related messages, and subscription management. It also    provides a variety of interfaces that support ttys and    low-function personal computers in addition to high-function    workstations. The current public release of Andrew, Version 5.1,  includes support forthe new Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) standardsfor multipart, multimedia mail.  A newer release, 5.2, for members ofthe Andrew Consortium has numerous additional features including neweditors for drawings, images, fonts, and user preferences.Remote Andrew Demo ServiceYou can try out Andrew from your own work station via the Remote AndrewDemo Service.  You need a host machine on the Internet running the X11window system.

They work fine when the widget is in X mode.  In GL mode they only work when the widget (my GL/X widget) is a childof a manager.

As I understand, PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH, which controlsnumber of characters to be displayed in text items, doesn'twork in the case of slider, despite the fact that <panel.h>contains the following bit:/* Panel_multiline_text_item, Panel_numeric_text_item, * Panel_slider_item and Panel_text_item attributes */PANEL_NOTIFY_LEVEL= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_ENUM, 152),PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_INT, 182),which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders.But 1) setting this attribute gives nothing, and 2) xv_get'tingthis attribute gives warning: Bad attribute, and return value 0.Can someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me,and clear this problem?Any help is very much appreciated.Yuriyuri@uk.ac.hw.phy

What I'd like to see is this scenario: Each widget, view, whatever, describes it's colors via a palette. Palettes can be shared and they only contain descriptive information. They are not directly tied to the object that uses them.  Palettes areheld in the server.  A palette can accomadate, up to, the number ofhardware color cells of color descriptors. When the input focus is in a particular widget, that widget has accessto all of the colors that are described in its associated palette.  ALLOTHER WIDGETS, TRANSIENTLY, GET THE CLOSEST APPROXIMATION THAT CAN BEGENERATED BY A UNION OF THE COLORS FROM THE CURRENT PALETTE AND ANY FREECOLORS THAT ARE LEFT OVER. A widget specifies a color for imaging by providing an index (pixel)into its associated palette. The bold part above is hard and would need to be done in the server.

Ghostview is a postscript previewerthat uses ghostscript.From the ghostview README:    Ghostview -- An X11 user interface for ghostscript.Ghostview is full function user interface for ghostscript 2.4.Brief list of features:  - Ghostview parses any known version of Adobe's Document Structuring    Conventions.  - Page size is automatically determined from the Document Structuring    Comments.  The user is able to override the values from the comments.  - Window size is set to the bounding box for Encapsulated PostScript figures.  - Default page size is Letter and can be changed via Xresources or    application defaults file to A4 (or any other valid size) for our    European friends.  - Scrollbars appear when necessary.  - Page orientation is automatically determined from the Document Structuring    Comments.  The user is able to override the values from the comments.  - Ability to view at 4 orientations: Portrait, Landscape, Upside-down,    and Seascape (for those who rotate landscape the other direction).  - Ability to preview in any supported visual.  (Can preview in gray-scale     or color on a Color monitor.)  - Ability to mark pages for printing, or saving.

I have looked at Motif++, WWL, InterViews, GINA++,and a few variations on the above.  I've also done a cursory examinationof Rogue Wave's View.h++.  I like View.h++'s abstractions best of all of thetoolkits I mentioned, but the resulting code looks little like Motif, and Ihave little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise resultin significant longevity for my code.  GINA++ allows you to write code whichlooks a great deal like Motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance,but the resulting code is almost too Motif-like, and is certainly notsignificantly less verbose than equivalent C code.  InterViews lookspromising, but I haven't found a free version with Motif support, and I'mnot confident how widely InterViews with Motif support will be adopted,and what (if any) specific Motif support will be available over time.  Theother libraries produce code which is less Motif-like, but which does not makesufficient use of the features of C++ to simplify my coding task.At this point, my inclination is to write my Motif manipulation routines inC, and invoke those routines from my C++ code using simple abstractions suitedto my specific task.  Later, if OSF or some credible standards-setting bodycomes up with a C++ interface to Motif, I will change to that.  It does meno goo to write in C++ if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code whichleaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industrydirections.  It's better to take a standard if inferior solution for nowthan to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with bothuseless code and useless skills a few years from now.  Views.h++ is the onlylibrary I'd consider right now, but in our environment, we'd end up spendingnearly $5000 to use it, and I can't justify it when it's likely to causeshort-term productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction, and isunlikely to be a sufficiently long-lived solution for us to reap the benefitsat the high end of the J curve.- Brad-- Brad Daniels`|  "If money can't buy happiness,daniels@neosoft.com|   I guess I'll have to rent it."I don't work for NeoSoft, and|- Weird Al Yenkovicdon't speak for my employer.|

Personally if I was in his position I would   do exactly the same thing, John has obviously put in lot of time and effort   into xv and why shouldn't he receive some money for it.It is interesting to look at the change(s) of mind that John has had.The AUTHOR file for xgif (an early incarnation of xv) reads (in part) as follows...  Do whatever you want with this program, though it *would* be nice if my name  remained on it somewhere...  Other than that, it may be freely modified,  distributed, and used to fill up disk space.The README file for xv 1.00 (?) reads (in part) as follows...  NOTE:  If you like the program and decide to use it, *please* send me a short  email message to that effect.  Be sure to mention the full name of your  organization.  When our sponsors ask us 'what have you been doing', it would  be most handy to be able to come up with a nice long list of organizations  that are using code developed in the GRASP Lab.

Also, if you find XV to be nifty, useful, generally 'cool', and of  some value to you, your donation (not tax-deductable) would be greatly  appreciated.  $10 (U.S.) is probably a fine amount to donate.  Folks who donate $25 and up will receive a nice, bound copy of the XV Manual  printed on a spiffo 600-dpi laser printer.  It'll look lovely mounted over  your fireplace.Which looks to me as a suggestion (see Julian's comment above).The copyright notices as it appeared then was...  * Copyright 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992 by John Bradley and  *                       The University of PennsylvaniaThe README for xv 3.00 reads (in part) as follows...  XV is shareware for PERSONAL USE only.  You may use XV for your own  amusement, and if you find it nifty, useful, generally cool, or of  some value to you, your non-deductable donation would be greatly  appreciated.  $25 is the suggested donation, though, of course,  larger donations are quite welcome.  Folks who donate $25 or more  can receive a printed, bound copy of the XV manual for no extra  charge.  If you want one, just ask.  BE SURE TO SPECIFY THE VERSION  OF XV THAT YOU ARE USING!  Commercial, government, and institutional users MUST register their  copies of XV, for the exceedingly REASONABLE price of just $25 per  workstation/X terminal.  Site licenses are available for those who  wish to run XV on a large number of machines.

Yep, /dev/null   had a mode of 600.  (Arrghhh!!)  ]]With renewed interest in "setting the DISPLAY variable", etc.. Ithought I would post my contribution.This Perl script is my solution.  It trys to be intelligent aboutwhat it's doing so that you should be able to type "rx host.domain.etc",and get a xterm running on "host.domain.etc", with all the difficultstuff taken care of.In theory, this program can do *everything* you ever wanted to dowhen you wanted to run a remote command in the background - itdoesn't even need to be an X program.  Try a "rx big-machine make"for instance, for a backgrounded make on the remote "big-machine".For more details and a full list of features read the README file,about 20 lines below...  All comments welcome.Duncan.#! /bin/sh# This is a shell archive.  Remove anything before this line, then unpack# it by saving it into a file and typing "sh file".

Version 3.1.7XXCopyright 1992 Duncan Sinclair <sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk>XXTrivial to install, but there's an Imakefile to make it even more trivial.XXThe perl script needs some customisation before it is installed, justXedit the "rx.pl" file, and read the comments.  Once you've doneXthis you can "xmkmf", then "make install install.man".XXFEATURES:XX*) Does the right thing for off-site remote execution.  IncludingX   setting up $DISPLAY to include domain names, and passingX   magic cookies, or doing the "xhost" stuff.XX*) Allow different remote user name.  (rx -l user host ...)XX*) Smart quoting of arguments - makes passing wild-cards easy.XX*) Custom command execution - link it to "remacs" to get a remoteX   emacs command.XX*) Automatic xterm options - names the xterm according to hostname,X   and turns on "login shell".XX*) Default command is xterm.XX*) Propagates X-ish env. variables to remote session - user mayX   extend the list of variables to pass.XX*) Special handling for bourne shell users.XX*) Tries to do remote execution from same directory as local.X   That is, it propagates $PWD, in an intelligent manner.XX*) Logs errors in a file.XX*) Overall Intelligence (TM) - makes reasoned decisions about whatX   you are trying to do, and tries to "do the right thing".XX*) Written in Perl, for portability and hackability.XXFor more info, read the man page or the source.XEND_OF_FILEif test 1442 -ne `wc -c <'README'`; then    echo shar: \\"'README'\\" unpacked with wrong size!fi# end of 'README'fiif test -f 'Imakefile' -a "${1}" != "-c" ; then   echo shar: Will not clobber existing file \\"'Imakefile'\\"elseecho shar: Extracting \\"'Imakefile'\\" \\(370 characters\\)sed "s/^X//" >'Imakefile' <<'END_OF_FILE'X# Glasgow RX Imakefile.XX         PROGRAMS = rxXXall:: $(PROGRAMS)XXinstall:: safeXXInstallNamedProg(rx.pl,rx,$(BINDIR))XInstallManPage(rx,$(MANDIR))XXinstall::X$(RM) $(BINDIR)/rxtermX$(LN) $(BINDIR)/rx $(BINDIR)/rxtermXXsafe:X@grep -s 'debug = 0' rx.pl || falseXXshar: safeXmakekit -m -pX@-perl -pi -e "s/sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk/sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk/;" Part*XEND_OF_FILEif test 370 -ne `wc -c <'Imakefile'`; then    echo shar: \\"'Imakefile'\\" unpacked with wrong size!fi# end of 'Imakefile'fiif test -f 'MANIFEST' -a "${1}" != "-c" ; then   echo shar: Will not clobber existing file \\"'MANIFEST'\\"elseecho shar: Extracting \\"'MANIFEST'\\" \\(313 characters\\)sed "s/^X//" >'MANIFEST' <<'END_OF_FILE'X   File NameArchive #DescriptionX-----------------------------------------------------------X README                     1Read me firstX Imakefile                  1X MANIFEST                   1This shipping listX Makefile                   1X rx.man                     1X rx.pl                      1END_OF_FILEif test 313 -ne `wc -c <'MANIFEST'`; then    echo shar: \\"'MANIFEST'\\" unpacked with wrong size!fi# end of 'MANIFEST'fiif test -f 'Makefile' -a "${1}" != "-c" ; then   echo shar: Will not clobber existing file \\"'Makefile'\\"elseecho shar: Extracting \\"'Makefile'\\" \\(10172 characters\\)sed "s/^X//" >'Makefile' <<'END_OF_FILE'X# Makefile generated by imake - do not edit!X# $XConsortium: imake.c,v 1.65 91/07/25 17:50:17 rws Exp $X#X# The cpp used on this machine replaces all newlines and multiple tabs andX# spaces in a macro expansion with a single space.

To allow the executionXof X programs, it copies a number of environmental variables toXthe remote session.  If you omitX.IR command ,Xthen rx will start an xterm on the remote host.  TheX.B rxtermXvarient starts a remote xterm on a host, and also passesX.I argsXto the remote xterm as arguments.X.PPXShell metacharacters which are not quoted are interpreted on the localXmachine, while quoted metacharacters are interpreted on the remoteXmachine.X.PPXIf the name of the file from whichX.B rxXis executed is anything other than ``rx,''X.B rxXtakes this name, stripped on a leading ``r'' as the commandXto run on the remote host, using anyX.I commandXparameters as arguments for the remote command.X.PPXIfX.B rxXthinks you are usingX.B xauthXbased X authorisation, and you are calling to a off-site host, orXto a different username, it will attempt to copy an authorizationXkey to the remote account.

I want to have a window to the Sun and the 3B2 on the NCD X-Terminal at thesame time.  I can do this if I manually set the Network Parameter TCP/IPAccess Control List to off, then login to my telnet session. Not Great!    I've tried to get "xhost" to work and failed.  Either my syntax is wrongor the X11R3 implementation is bogus.    I am trying to edit the NCD configuration file that is loaded when the NCD boots.  No matter what entry I add or edit, the NCD still boots withthe TCP/IP Access Control list containing only the 3B2.  My manuals are worthless so any help would be most appreciated!!

That way, the cmapfocus won't slavishly follow keyboard focus, but will beat its own path.(if you have keyboardFocusPolicy: explicit, you can set cmap focusexplicit also, but you then need a binding to f.focus_color, probably onMB1).-- David Brooksdbrooks@osf.orgOpen Software Foundationuunet!osf.org!dbrooksShowres soote my foote

I believethat X is grabbing the first font on the path with these characteristicsand displaying it.  Since I have only 75dpi and 100dpi fonts on mypath, the results are inaccurate.  I do have some Speedo fonts, butnot for the family I am using (Helvetica).I think this is incorrect.  The fonts should always be provided in theresolution of the display.  This never seems to happen unless youexplicitly request fonts by xres and yres!  This is true of both thescaleable and bitmapped fonts!  For instance, the commandxfd -fn '-bitstream-charter-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*'Will invoke a 75dpi font (despite the fact that this is a Speedo font).The command  xfd -fn '-adobe-courier-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*'Will invoke a 75dpi font or a 100dpi font (depending on my font path).Despite the fact that X knows my display is 85 dpi, and that it cangenerate an 85dpi font for me!  Unless I my applications specifies aresolution, X appears to pick a stupid default.Is this a bug?  Is it a feature?  If so, why?  Is there anything I cando to get around this problem?  People have suggested that I lie aboutmy resolution, and specify a single font path (75 or 100, not both).This would at least make my app consistent, but I like being able tolook at rulers that appear in my paint application and say: "Yup, thatsan inch".

Namely, some Xlib operations work, and some do not. Inparticular, the expose consist of two XFillRectangle calls followed by someXDrawPoint calls, and for reasons unknown to me the point calls are failingwhenever a pulldown or popup up menu is (clicked on and) moved in therightward direction over the drawing area, but after the move, is still onsome part of the drawing area. This also happens less consistently when thepulldown/popup is moved in the leftward direction.Assuming that my code is not doing anything incredibly odd, is this a serverbug?Thanks,Zack T. Smith

Their configurationis the same as yours, so it "should" be a Plug'N'Play situation, EXCEPT:I don't know if your hi-res mono monitor will function this way.  However,you may simply be able to pull the motherboard and set the HI-RES jumper(located in the same jumper array as the jumpers for the RAM/SIMM selectsand Ethernet connection) and be happily on your way.  When you pull themotherboard, the jumpers are in the left-rear (e.g. "north-west") quadrantof the motherboard (to the left of the SIMM sockets).Thad Floryan [ thad@btr.com, thad@cup.portal.com, thad@netcom.com ]

They place the title at that positionand the window at a position below it.This becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its currentconfiguration and restore is later.Currently, my solution is:XCreateWindow(...);XSetWMProperties(..);XMapWindow(...);XFlush(...);XMoveWindow(...);It works with olwm, but is less than elegant. All this leaves me wonderingif I'm overlooking something obvious.Richard.

A hundred of them on a single ethernet might be>a problem, but a couple dozen should be fine.Bandwidth is unlikely to be the problem, except over a wet string network.One of major flaws of X is the horrendous number of transactions (andhence process switches) that it forces upon a host.  Actual measurements(hourly average) are 5 per second per logged in user, which can lead to20-50 or more process switches (depending on whether each event isfiltered by the window manager as well as the applications and howmany processes are needed for each character.)While a blinking cursor needs only the application and the networkingprocess, and does not add any transactions, it will add something like10 process switches per second per user.  This is a significant increasein overhead, especially as the application may have quite a large workingset.  If you want a rapidly blinking cursor, there could be as manyas 50.If you want to go there, I wouldn't start from here!Nick MaclarenUniversity of Cambridge Computer Laboratory,New Museums Site, Pembroke Street,Cambridge CB2 3QG, England.Email:  nmm1@cus.cam.ac.ukTel.:   +44 223 334761Fax:    +44 223 334679

Well, yes and no.  I don't particularly want this discussion to sparka lengthy debate, but I do think it's worth pointing out that "popularusage" is not always sufficient excuse.  In this case, for example, I think an appropriate parallel may be foundin the pronunciation of proper names: if people commonly misspelled or mispronounced your name, would you feel compelled to change it?  Probablynot.  The same is true of X.  "The X Window System", "X", "X11", and relatedmonickers are proper names in the same sense that any product name is aproper name.  In fact, some of them are *trademarked* names.  The fact that many people get them wrong is largely beside the point.  As for the trade publications that promulgate things like "X Window" or"X.windows" or any of the other nonsensical variants one often sees, consider the fact that these publications are supposedly written by *journalists*.  Would you trust the facts of a journalist who couldn'tbe bothered to get the name of his/her source right?

You have to > be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments.>  Well, part of the routines I mentioned do a dirty little trick to get around  that problem. First, I create the shared memory segment, attach the client,  attach the X server, and then remove (!) the segment. If you read the man  pages on removing of shared memory segments, you will see that the segment  only dies after all attachments are gone.  Now, if the client dies, that's one attachment gone (the OS cleans up for you)  and since the X server notices the client has dies, frees up it's resources,  including detaching from the segment: there goes the last attachment. No more  shared memory segment.  Terrible, but it works.Regards,Richard Gooch....

My immediate alternativewas to load only the neccessary files to boot the system. This resulted innot loading openwindows. As a result of which none of the X-libraries got loaded.   I am trying to load just the libraries and include files and bin/X11 files required for running X-windows and compiling my programs written for Xlib and Xaw.In a desperate effort to regain x-windows, i retrieved /usr/lib/libX*.* files fromthe tape . /usr/bin/X11/*  and /usr/include/X11/* . Is this enough for running X-windows  BUt i did not get /usr/lib/X11/fonts/  sub directories . these are mainly 100dpi, 75dpi and misc. when i run xinit, the error message says /usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi etc are not in thedefault path. But the problem is i cannot load any of those directories as there is nodisk space. Are there any temporary suggestions before I get a 1.5 GB disk and load openwindows , tojust have my x-windows running. ThanksPramod --

Free optionsThe BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2.Any other version of X386 will have slower performance, and willbe more difficult to compile.  Information on how to obtain XFree86is listed below.X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that wasdone by Thomas Roell (roell@sgcs.com).It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards.There are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4,X386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. youdon't need to patch it into the MIT source any more).X386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS (see below).2.

What is XFree86?   XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with   X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and   other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:    1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,       selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require       an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of       1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by       default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield       up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.    2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default       operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now       equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately       20% faster than X386 1.2.    3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,       or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4       with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from       SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.    4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.       Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about       the ATI and Trident drivers.    5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's       code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).    6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is       compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the       contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.    7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font       renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary       distributions.    8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.    9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA       cards is now included.   The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2   (they were not in XFree86 1.1):    1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of       available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200        (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).    2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the       monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a "two       headed" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only       been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).    3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.    4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to       consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for       more information.)    5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some        versions of these devices were not previously compatible).    6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor       timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous       documentation and a lot of experimentation).    7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including       implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many        vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more        information).    8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has       been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of       0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks       line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.    9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig       configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative       and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new       options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1)        manual page for more information on the format of this file).       Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file       in the source distribution for full details.   Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the   current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.4. What OSs are supported?    XFree86 supports:SVR4.2: Consensys V4.2SVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHCSVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2Linux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1BSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most activeBSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,but anyone should feel free to submit patches.If you are interested in tackling this, send mail toxfree86@physics.su.oz.au5. What video hardware is supported?   At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:Tseng ET4000Tseng ET3000Paradise PVGA1Western Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets ofthe PVGA1, and use its driver)Genoa GVGATrident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000ATI 18800, 28800All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,with the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in256 color mode.The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k ofvideo memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On theET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochromeserver, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going tonon-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  Toavoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree861.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixelclock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms arediscovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on howthese programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop sucha program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it withfuture XFree86 releases.If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as theOrchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will notwork with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details.In fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamondproducts, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributionsof code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).If you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISAvideo cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between theCPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. Itcould be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipseton the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lotof access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untestedtheory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things notworking on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86working fine on them.6. What about accelerated boards?At this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boardslike the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is availablein commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact<hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.A beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memorycontains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-planes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from eachof each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-buffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT codecould be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure).But for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-bufferimplementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,but nothing is yet available from the project.8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?Obviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To runX efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, dependingon the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).To build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space willbe required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable lower bound.9. Where can I get source for XFree86?Source patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22from MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:export.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)(For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)Refer to the README file under the specified directory for informationon which files you need to get to build your distribution.10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from:ftp.physics.su.oz.au- SVR4 binariesunder /XFree86/SVR4ftp.win.tue.nl- SVR4 binariesunder /pub/XFree86/SVR4ferkel.ucsb.edu- SVR4 binariesunder /pub/SVR4/XFree86stasi.bradley.edu- SVR4 binariesunder /pub/XFree86/SVR4blancmange.ma.utexas.edu- SVR3 (ISC) binariesunder /pub/ISCftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binariesunder /pub/pc/isc/XFree86tsx-11.mit.edu- Linux binariesunder /pub/linux/packages/X11agate.berkeley.edu- 386BSD binariesunder /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86ftp.cs.uwm.edu- Mach binariesunder /i386Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites mayarchive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution willcontain a README file that describes what files you need to takefrom the archive, and which compile-time option selections weremade when building the distribution.IV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?11. Installation directoriesThe top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot(/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, includefiles, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.This can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modifiedvia symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory isnonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installedalongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.12. Configuration filesThe XFree86 server reads a configuration file ("Xconfig") on startup.The search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented inthe server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modesDavid E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of knownclock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, andis in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database isalso available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept onexport.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updatedoccasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have thesettings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them toDavid for inclusion in the database.If this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and usethis description to get them right.  When you do, send the informationto David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.NOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and      is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot      clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from      your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.      You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your      Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up      starting the server in the future.14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kitIf you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible toreconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This isfully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.V) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?First of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).15. SVR4Why won't my xterm run properly?If your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should defineCONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run.csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no'The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymappingproblems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not beinstalled.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.16. SVR3Make sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running.17. 386BSDMake sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.Also, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey<Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in thefile XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:    agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2    wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2    grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.218. LinuxYou must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gccjump libraries installed.Make sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.If your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have torun the server as "X -pn". The default startup configuration assumesthat TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files/usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the-pn argument to X386.Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the majornumber 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is notowned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permitconsole output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, butstartx won't.When running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it witha tty, for example "xdm < /dev/console &".For more detailed information, please read the file README presentwith the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.19. MachMake sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.VI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?This section has been removed from the FAQ, since it isfully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.Please look at those files for information on building XFree86.VII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?20. BSD compatibility libraryA lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.awhich contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),seed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include<X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macrodefinitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions.  If you arelinking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of thesefunctions, then you should link with libXbsd.a21. ANSICCOPTIONSThis is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of theANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewritethe entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you'd seesomething likeCCOPTIONS="-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings"and to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to putCCOPTIONS="-O2 -fwritable-strings"in his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default ofANSICCOPTIONS="-ansi"CCOPTIONS="-O2 -fwritable-strings"and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:ANSICCOPTIONS=to get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible deathwith -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, becauseCCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one mustadd 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.XFree86 Contact Information    Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86    Core Team.

Archie  provides information about files available for ftp anywhere on the  Internet; Xarchie displays this information using an easy-to-use,  point-and-click interface.  Xarchie allows you to further explore ftp  sites by examining directories returned as query matches, and allows  you to retrieve files located this way.Xarchie 2.0 has been extensively tested on R4, R5, and a variety ofother flavors of X, and on a wide range of machines. A summary of thenew features (from the README) follows:  * Major improvements include:    - Multiple selections allowed in browser for use with other new      features (FWF MultiList widget).    - Ability to expand directories in browser.    - Real fully-integrated ftp implementation.    - Ability to save and reload query results, as well as print them.    - Ability to resort results, and sort results by user-definable      pseudo-weights.    - Online help browser.    - Color resources, done so that they don't break mono displays.    - FWF FileSelector widget for local file operations.    - Makefile.dst's supplied for the imake-impaired.George-- George Ferguson                 ARPA: ferguson@cs.rochester.eduDept. of Computer Science       UUCP: rutgers!rochester!fergusonUniversity of Rochester         VOX:  (716) 275-2527Rochester  NY  14627-0226       FAX:  (716) 461-2018

It evaluates everything totrue no matter what the conditionals are.For example, makedepend chokes on one of X11 include files (as distributedby Sun) - namely Xos.h:#if     !defined(SUNOS41) || defined(__STDC__)#       include <string.h>#       define  index   strchr#       define  rindex  strrchr#else   /* BSD && !__STDC__ */#       include <strings.h>#endif  /* !SUNOS41 || __STDC__ */Here 'makedepend' evaluates both #if and corresponding #else statementsto 'true' and tries to open the file <strings.h> which doesn't existunder Solaris2.We also have a lot of #if statements in some of our legacy code.We got and built 'makedepend' off the net - it didn't fix the problem.In all fairness it should be noted that 'makdepend' man-page (Sun'sdistribution) mentions this problem:BUGS     If you do not have  the  source  for  cpp,  the  Berkeley  C     preprocessor, then makedepend will be compiled in such a way     that all #if directives will evaluate to  "true"  regardless     of  their  actual  value.

What they'd like to do is:Given a window that is taking a long time to draw (because either  thedata  is  arriving  over a slow link, or the $DISPLAY is across a slowlink), they would like to first paint a low-resolution version of  thepicture,  and then repaint it in higher resolution.  Thus, the picturemight first be generated in 1/4 resolution, with each  4x4  square  ofpixels  being  filled  in  with a single color.  Next, each 4x4 squarewould be replaced by 4 2x2 squares; finally the 1x1 version  would  bepainted.Since  one of the scenarios is with the window being on the other sideof a slow link, the low-res version obviously wouldn't be  transmittedas  a bitmap; that wouldn't help at all.  Instead, there would have tobe a process on the far end that receives the  low-res  picture  as  asmall  bitmap,  and  blows up each pixel into a square (sorta like themagnifier programs do).  This brings up the question of whether the  Xserver  can help.  That is, when a window is opened, is there a way toask that a "filter" program be run to process the pixels?  Or  is  theonly  way  to  use  something  like  rsh  to start up a remote process("Permission denied" ;-), and have it open a local window?It seems the most likely scenario is a library routine that starts  upsuch  a  program  remotely, and then accepts bitmaps, compressing eachone by some amount, and sending them to the remote program to  expand.But  if  there is something that X itself can do to help, it's be niceto hear about it.  (I looked in several FMs,  but  if  it's  there,  Iobviously  don't  know  the keywords ;-).  If someone has a nifty toolavailable that packages it all, we might want to get a copy.Oh, yes; this is to run on some Suns.  Part of the idea  is  to  builddemos  that  can  show such things as "If this were run across, say, a4800-bps link, this is how fast the pictures would appear."  Then  thecustomer would get a feel for the speed that they need to pay for.-- If the auto industry were like the computer industry, a car would  nowcost $5, would get 5000 miles to the gallon, and at random times wouldexplode, killing all its passengers.

Im having a problem I hope someone here canhelp me with. I create a window, and I want it to have some background color,say red, and draw an oval in it. Further, when I resize the window, I wantto be able to redraw the image so that is fills the new window (whether itis larger or smaller.) Im using AIXwindows on an RS6000.My problem is this: when I resize the window, only the "original" part of thewindow that was part of the window creation gets drawn into. Everything elseis a grey..the oval "tries" to redraw itself but gets clipped. I can see thatit WOULD be the right size if I could see all of it, but it only shows up inthe region that was the original size of the window when created.For example, I start out the window at 200x200 in width and height. If Iresize it to 400x400, the only part that has any color drawn into it isis from the origin out to 200x200..the rest is grey. Further the ovalonly shows up in that 200x200 area.What am I doing wrong?? How can I get a window to resize and redraw a re-scaled image in it to take up the full size of the window?Second question:Could someone tell me what Xaw and Xmu are???Thanks,Chris

How do I make a screendump or print my application?The xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window or the background. It produces an XWD-format file of the image of that window. The file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr client and your local printing mechanism. You can use this command:csh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd &and then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire currentdisplay will be saved into the file output.xwd. Note that xwd also has anundocumented (before R5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the command-line. [There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for specifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture.]Two publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of arbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc.There are several versions of xgrabsc; version 2.2, available on export [8/92]is the most recent.xsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders XPM output [version unknown]. It is available on export or avahi.inria.fr;see xsnap-pl2.tar.Z.A screen-dump and merge/edit program combining features of xwd and xpris available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.Z. Information: soft-eng@cs.uwm.edu.xprint, by Alberto Accomazzi (alberto@cfa.harvard.edu) is availablefrom cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.Z.To post-process the xwd output of some of these tools, you can use xpr,which is part of the X11 distribution. Also on several archives are xwd2psand XtoPS, which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for use in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwd2ps.tar.Z andcontrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z). Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archiveservers; and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output.The XV program can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate it, andsave it in one of the available formats. ImageMagick has similar capabilities.Also: Bristol Technology (info@bristol.com, 203-438-6969) offers Xprinter 2.0, an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers; a demo is on ftp.uu.netin vendor/Bristol/Xprinter.ColorSoft 9619-459-8500) offers OPENprint package includes a screen-capture facility, image-processing, and support for PostScript and non-PostScript printers.Some vendors' implementations of X (e.g. DECWindows and OpenWindows) include session managers or other desktop programs which include "print portionof screen" or "take a snapshot" options. Some platforms also have tools which can be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the Sun systems, for example, have a 'screendump' program which produces a Sun raster file. Some X terminals have local screen-dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer.Some vendors' implementations of lpr (e.g. Sony) include direct support for printing xwd files, but you'll typically need some other package to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  25)  How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display?If you need color PostScript in particular, you can - grab the screen-image using a program which can produce color PostScript, such as xgrabsc and xv - grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color PS.You can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick distribution. The PBMPLUS package is also good for this, as is the Xim package.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  26)  How do I make a screendump including the X cursor?This can't be done unless the X server has been extended. Consider instead a system-dependent mechanism for, e.g.,  capturing the frame-buffer.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  27)  How do I convert/view Mac/TIFF/GIF/Sun/PICT/img/FAX images in X?The likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzer's useful++ Portable Bitmap Toolkit, which includes a number of programs for converting among various image formats. It includes support for many types of bitmaps, gray-scale images, and full-color images. PBMPLUS has been updated recently;the most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z.Another tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center's IMtools ('imconv' in particular), which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary.It's available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22).Useful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost's xloadimage, aversion of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage; there are later versions available, including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export.  Graeme Gill's updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export; see xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2/93.xv (X Image Viewer), written by bradley@cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley), can read and display pictures in Sun Raster, PGM, PBM, PPM, X11 bitmap, TIFF, GIF and JPEG. It can manipulate on the images: adjust, color, intensity, contrast, aspect ratio, crop). It can save images in all of the aforementioned formats plus PostScript. It can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate on it, and save it in one of the available formats. The program was updated 5/92; see the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.The Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation, by Michael Mauldin <mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu>.Conversion and manipulation package, similar to PBMPLUS.  Version 1.0 availablevia FTP as nl.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.Z, uunet.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.Z, and ucsd.edu:graphics/fbm.tar.Z.The Img Software Set, by Paul Raveling <raveling@venera.isi.edu>, readsand writes its own image format, displays on an X11 screen, and does some imagemanipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP on expo.lcs.mit.edu ascontrib/img_1.3.tar.Z, along with large collection of color images.The Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar to PBMPLUS.  Available via FTP as cs.utah.edu:pub/urt-*, weedeater.math.yale.edu:pub/urt-*, and freebie.engin.umich.edu:pub/urt-*.Xim, The X Image Manipulator, by Philip Thompson, does essential interactive displaying, editing, filtering, and converting of images. There is a version in the X11R4 contrib area; but a more recent version (using R4 and Motif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). Xim reads/writes gif, xwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has alibrary and command-line utilities for building your own applications.ImageMagick [2.3; 2/93] by cristy@dupont.com can be retrieved from export's contrib area. It is a collection of utilities to transform and displayimages on any X server. The tool uses the MIFF format; filters to and from MIFFfrom other popular formats (PPM, TIFF, GIF, SUN Raster, etc) are included.xtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was writtento handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remainingsimple, portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problemswith building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is distributedas part of Sam Leffler's libtiff package and it is also available onexport.lcs.mit.edu, uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x. [dbs@decwrl.dec.com,10/90]xtiff 2.0 was announced in 4/91; it includes Xlib and Xt versions.A version of Lee Iverson's (leei@McRCIM.McGill.EDU) image-viewing toolis available as contrib/vimage-0.9.3.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.  The package also includes an ImageViewPort widget and a FileDialog widget. [12/91;5/92] [some material from Larry Carroll (larryc@poe.jpl.nasa.gov), 5/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  28)  How can I change the titlebar of my xterm window?The solution involves sending an escape sequence to xterm which willcause it to update the property which the window manager relies upon for thestring which appears in the window titlebar.A solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a shell:echo "ESC]2;TEXT^G"where ESC is the escape key, TEXT is the string you wish to have displayed,and ^G is a Control-G (the BEL character).Here is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar tothe current working directory when you change directories:alias newcd 'cd \\!*; echo -n ESC]2\\;$cwd^G'The digit '2' in these strings indicates to xterm that it should change only the title of the window; to change both the title and the name used in the icon, use the digit '0' instead, and use '1' to change only the icon name.Note: another way to do this, which prevents an incorrect display ofthe local directory if a modified `cd` is used in a subshell, is to wrap theescape sequences into the PS1 prompt itself.Note: on an IBM RS/6000 is may be necessary to begin the sequence witha ^V.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  29)  Where can I find the xterm control sequences?The best source of such information is in your R5 sources in the file ctlseqs.ms; a PostScript version is in mit/hardcopy/clients/ctlseqs.PS.Z.O'Reilly's Volume 3, the X User's Guide, includes an R5 version of the control sequences; the standard volume will be available 3/93, and a Motif version of the book is available now. The current (R4) guide includes an outdated versionof the control sequences. [1/93]Other good sources of information include the R4 version of that documentand also the file in the R4 sources called mit/clients/xterm/ctlseq2.txt, a compilation put together by Skip Montanaro (GE CR&D) listing the VT100 sequences. It dates from R3 but is fairly accurate.  A hardcopy version was published in the December 1989 XNextEvent (the XUG newsletter).In a pinch, a VT100 manual will do.[last updated 10/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  30)- Why does the R3 xterm, et al, fail against the R4 server?----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  31)  How can I use characters above ASCII 127 in xterm ?In order to use special characters such as the o-umlaut, you need to "stty pass8" but also to use a charcell ISO8859 font, such as XTerm*font: -*-*-medium-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1XTerm*boldfont:-*-*-bold-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1[The family is intentionally unspecified in this example.]In addition, you may want to set this in your shell:setenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1        For a given character above 127, you can determine the key to use with the Alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below 127 (try using`man ascii`). For example, o-umlaut (v) is Alt-v and the section character (') is Alt-'. [thanks to Greg Holmberg (greg%thirdi@uunet.uu.net) and Stephen Gildea (gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu); 6/92]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  32)  Why are my xterm menus so small?You are probably setting the geometry small accidentally. If you give a resource specification like this:xterm*geometry: 80x24then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to80x24. For the main window, this is OK, as it uses characters for its size. But its popup menus don't; they are in pixels and show up small. To set onlythe terminal widget to have the specified geometry, name it explicitly:xterm*VT100.geometry: 80x24----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  33)  How can I print the current selection?You could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command. However, a program by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for manipulating the selection will help; e.g. % xselection PRIMARY | lprfinds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a window-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting ofthe selection and other properties. A version is on export.Also available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z, which can beadapted to do this.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  34)  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources?You can use several environment variables to control how resources are loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at mostone app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another fromthe path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open Windows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever yourOPENWINHOME is located):setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%NThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see XtResolvePathname()):        %N      The value of the filename parameter, or the                application's class name.        %T      The value of the file "type".  In this case, the                literal string "app-defaults"        %C      customization resource (R5 only)        %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults.        %L      Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. "ja_JP.EUC")        %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. "ja")        %t      The territory part of the display's language string        %c      The codeset part of the display's language stringLet's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is "Myterm". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/MytermAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above app-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.Let's consider another example. This time, let's set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%NThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the applicationfrom the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loadedproperly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and%S are useless.With R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization resource value.  For example, you might run the "myterm" application like this:myterm -xrm "*customization: -color"If one of your pathname specifications had the value"/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C" then the expanded pathname would be"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color" because the %C substitution character takes on the value of the customization resource.The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\     (R5)/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot inthis batch of default settings.)The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is <root>/%L/%N%C:\\  (R5)<root>/%l/%N%C:\\  (R5)<root>/%N%C:\\     (R5)<root>/%L/%N:\\<root>/%l/%N:\\<root>/%N:<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR to ".", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to "./", a dot followed by a slash.[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@world.std.com); 2/93.]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  35)  How to I have the R4 xdm put a picture behind the log-in window?The answer lies in changing xdm's xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run aprogram to change the background before loading the resources; for example, your /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line DisplayManager.0.authorize: false to permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also DisplayManager*xrdb:/usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdbwhere that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of:#!/bin/sh#comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources/usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap/usr/bin/X11/xrdb $*Substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot, to taste.  Note that this is a general hack that can be used to invoke a console window or any other client.[Thanks to Jay Bourland (jayb@cauchy.stanford.edu), 9/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  36)  Why isn't my PATH set when xdm runs my .xsession file?When xdm runs your .xsession it doesn't source your .cshrc or .loginfiles. You can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any SH script;or you can place all environment-setting statements in a separate file andsource it from both the .xsession file and your shell configuration file; or,if you set your PATH in your .cshrc file, the normal place, you can make your .xsession have PATH set simply by making it a csh script, i.e. by startingyour .xsession file off with "#!/bin/csh". If this doesn't work, also try starting off with:#!/bin/sh# Reset path:PATH=`csh -c 'echo $PATH'` ; export PATH----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  37)  How do I keep my $DISPLAY when I rlogin to another machine?There are several ways to avoid having to do a "setenv DISPLAY ..."whenever you log in to another networked UNIX machine running X.One solution is to use the clients/xrsh on the R5 contrib tape.  It includes xrsh, a script to start an X application on remote machine, andxrlogin, a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine.A more recent version is on export in xrsh-5.4.shar.One solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse(mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu). You can ftp caveat-emptor versions from132.206.1.1, in X/xrlogin.c and X/xrlogind.c. The program packages up $TERM and$DISPLAY into a single string, which is stuffed into $TERM.  rlogin then propagates $TERM normally; your .cshrc on the remote machine should containeval `xrlogind`where xrlogind is a program that checks $TERM and if it is of the special format it recognizes, unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to recreate the environment variables. [11/90]In addition, if all you need to do is start a remote X process on another host, and you findrsh <HOST> -n /usr/bin/X11/xterm -display $DISPLAY too simple (DISPLAY must have your real hostname), then this version of xrsh can be used to start up remote X processes. The equivalent usage would be xrsh <HOST> xterm  #! /bin/sh  # start an X11 process on another host  # Date: 8 Dec 88 06:29:34 GMT  # From: Chris Torek <chris@mimsy.umd.edu>  # rsh $host -n "setenv DISPLAY $DISPLAY; exec $@ </dev/null >&/dev/null"  #  # An improved version:  # rXcmd (suggested by John Robinson, jr@bbn.com)  #       (generalized for sh,ksh by Keith Boyer, keith@cis.ohio-state.edu)  #  # but they put the rcmd in ()'s which left zombies again.

See Ollie Jones's article in the November 91 X Journal for more information.The R3 contrib/ area (in fonts/utils/ and in clients/xtroff) contained a number of useful utilities, including some to convert between BDF font formatand a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor.An easier way is to use the "xfed" client to modify an existing font; aversion is on the R4 or R5 X11R5 contrib tape in contrib/clients/xfed. Xfed is available for anonymous ftp on ftp.Informatik.Uni-Dortmund.DE [129.217.64.63], possibly as file /pub/windows/X/Diverse-X11-Sourcen/xfed.tar.Z. It can produceBDF-format fonts which can be compiled for a variety of X servers.The xfedor client from Group Bull permits creation of bitmaps, cursors,XPM1 pixmaps, and fonts. Binaries for common machines are on avahi.inria.fr in/pub; in addition, the sources (an old Xlib implementation) have been placed [5/91] in export:/contrib. If you are a MetaFont user you can use "mftobdf" from the SeeTeXdistribution to convert PK, GF, and PXL fonts to BDF format; the distributionis on ftp.cs.colorado.edu and on export.lcs.mit.edu.The GNU package fontutils-0.4.tar.Z on prep.ai.mit.edu includes xbfe,a font editor, and a number of utilities for massaging font formats.The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains an article on using thesetools to modify a font.Fonts can be resized with Hiroto Kagotani's bdfresize; a new version isin ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp:/X11/contrib.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  39)  Why does adding a font to the server not work (sic)?After you have built the font using your system's font-compiler, installed it in some directory, and run `mkfontdir` or your system's equivalent(e.g. bldfamily for OpenWindows) in that directory, be sure to use `xset +fp $dir` to add that full path-name to the server's font-path, *or* if the directory is already in the path, use `xset fp rehash` so that the new fonts inthat directory are actually found; it is this last step that you're probably leaving out. (You can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in the path.)Sometimes your "xset +fp $dir" command fails with a BadValue error:X Error of failed request:BadValue(integer parameter out of range for operation)Major opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath)This means the X server cannot find or read your font directory, orthat your directory does not look like a font directory to the server.  (Themention of an "integer parameter" in the message is spurious.)-- Is the font directory you're specifying readable from the SERVER's file   system?  Remember, it's the server, not the client, which interprets your   font directory.  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an   xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. "xset +fp ~/myfonts") and   the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm.-- Is the directory really a font directory?  If you're running an MIT server   (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file   "fonts.dir".  If you can't find that file, run mkfontdir(1).  (If you're   running OpenWindows, look for the file "Families.list".  If you can't find   it, run bldfamily(1).)-- If you're in a site where some people run X11Rn servers and others run a   proprietary server with nonstandard font formats (OpenWindows, for   example), make sure the font directory is right for the server you're using.   Hint: if the directory contains .pcf and/or .snf files, it won't work for   Open Windows.  If the directory contains .ff and/or .fb files, it won't work   for X11Rn.[thanks to der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu) and to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com); 7/92 ]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  40)  How do I convert a ".snf" font back to ".bdf" font?A tool called "snftobdf 1.4" is part of the bdftools package, which is available from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/bdftools.tar.Z and from crl.nmsu.edu:pub/misc/bdftools.tar.Z.  [2/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  41)  What is a general method of getting a font in usable format?der Mouse's getbdf is one solution; it connects to a server and produces a .BDF file for any font the server is willing to let it.  It can be used as an anything-to-BDF converter, but requires access to a server that can understand the font file, thus is both more and less powerful than other tools such as snftobdf. getbdf is on 132.206.1.1 in X/getbdf.c or available via mail from mouse@larry.McRCIM.McGill.EDU. [5/91]In addition, the R5 program "fstobdf" can produce bdf for any font thatthe R5 server has access to.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  42)  How do I use DECwindows fonts on my non-DECwindows server?The DECwindows fonts typically don't exist on a non-DEC installation,but rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by DECwindows applications tostandard MIT fonts of similar characteristics and size. Pick up the file contrib/DECwindows_on_X11R4_font.aliases from export.lcs.mit.edu; this file is for a standard MIT R4 server.  It can also serve as a starting point for creating a similar aliases file for the Open Windows server or other servers which do not use the MIT font scheme.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  43)  How do I add ".bdf" fonts to my DECwindows server?The format of fonts preferred by DEC's X server is the ".pcf" format.You can produce this compiled format from the .bdf format by using DEC's dxfcfont-compiler. Note that the DEC servers can also use raw .bdf fonts, with aperformance hit.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  44)! How can I set backgroundPixmap in a defaults file? (What is XPM?)I want to be able to do something like this:xclock*backgroundPixmap:      /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/rootweaveYou can't do this. The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the same depth as the screen, not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). Because of this, writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible, since there is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. Therefore, neither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap converter, because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a resource.  The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for use in many of its widgets, however.[courtesy Chris D. Peterson (now kit@ics.com), 4/90]However:A specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of the xloadimage package by Jim Frost was posted 12/90 by Sebastian Wangnick (basti@unido.informatik.uni-dortmund.de); it permits loading of a number of image formats as a pixmap.The leading general-purpose format for pixmaps is the XPM format used by Groupe Bull in several of its programs, including the GWM window manager, byAT&T in its olpixmap editor, and by ICS in its interface builder. XPM distribution, available on export as contrib/xpm.tar.Z, includes read/write routines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want toallow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner.  See informationon the xpm-talk mailing list above. XPM 3.0f was announced in 3/93 and isavailable from export.lcs.mit.edu and avahi.inria.fr; an older version is on the R5 contrib tape. [A set of XPM icons collected by Anthony Thyssen (anthony@kurango.cit.gu.edu.au) is on export in contrib/AIcons.]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  45)  Why can't I override translations? Only the first item works.You probably have an extra space after the specification of the first item, like this:basic*text.translations:  #override \\Ctrl<Key>a:    beginning-of-line() \\n\\ Ctrl<Key>e:    end-of-line()      ^ extra spaceThe newline after that space is ending the translation definition.[Thanks to Timothy J.

Alternatively, you can probably set the timezone in the shell fromwhich you invoke the xclock or oclock, or use a script similar to this:#!/bin/shTZ=PST8PDT xclock -name "San_Luis_Obispo_CA" 2> /dev/null &TZ=EST5EDT xclock -name "King_Of_Prussia_PA" 2> /dev/null &----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  47)  I have xmh, but it doesn't work. Where can I get MH?The xmh mail-reader requires the Rand MH mail/message handling system,which is not part of the UNIX software distribution for many machines. A list of various ftp, uucp, e-mail and US-mail sites for both xmh and MH is given in the monthly MH FAQ; one source is ics.uci.edu in the file pub/mh/mh-6.7.tar.Z.If you do not receive the comp.mail.mh newsgroup or the MH-users mailing list, you can request a copy of the FAQ, which also includes a section on xmh, by sending mail to mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu containing the request"send usenet/news.answers/mh-faq".----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  48)  Why am I suddenly unable to connect to my Sun X server?After a seemingly random amount of time after the X server has been started, noother clients are able to connect to it.The default cron cleanup jobs supplied by Sun (for 4.0.3, at least)delete "old" (unreferenced) files from /tmp -- including /tmp/.X11-unix, which contains the socket descriptor used by X. The solution is to add "! -type s" tothe find exclusion in the cron job.[10/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  49)  Why don't the R5 PEX demos work on my mono screen?The R5 sample server implementation works only on color screens, sorry.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  50)! How do I get my Sun Type-[45] keyboard fully supported by Xsun? Many users wants the Num Lock key to light the Num Lock LED and have the appropriate effect on the numeric keypad. The Xsun server as distributed by MITdoesn't do this but there are two different patches available. The first patch is written by Jonathan Lemon and fixes the Num Lock related problems. It is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in the filecontrib/Xsun-R5.numlock_patch.Z . The second is written by Martin Forssen and fixes the Num Lock and Compose keysand adds support for the different national keyboard layouts for Type-4 and Type-5 keyboards. This patch is available from export.lcs.mit.edu incontrib/sunkbd1216-0314.tar.Z or via email from maf@dtek.chalmers.se. [thanks to Martin Forssen (maf@dtek.chalmers.se or maf@math.chalmers.se), 8/92]A set of patches by William Bailey (dbgwab@arco.com) was posted to newsgroups11/92 to provide support for the Type-5 keyboard.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  51)  How do I report bugs in X?Generally, report bugs you find to the organization that supplied youwith the X Window System.

Some Sun OWsystems, in particular, were shipped with the flawed version of the library, and applications which link against the library typically give the warnings youhave seen.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  53)  Where can I find a dictionary server for xwebster?Webster's still owns the copyright to the on-line copies of Webster'sDictionary which are found at various (university) sites. After it became awarethat these sites were then acting as servers for other sites running xwebster and gnuemacs-webster, it asked that server sites close off external access.[The NeXT machine apparently is also licensed to have the dictionary. AWebster daemon for NeXT machines is available from iuvax.cs.indiana.edu (129.79.254.192) in "pub/webster/NeXT-2.0".]Unless you want to get a legal on-line copy yourself or can find a sitewhich can grant you access, you are probably out of luck. However, if you are a legitimate site, you'll want to pick up thelatest xwebster, as-is on export:contrib/xwebster.tar.Z [10/91]; the file xwebster.README includes discussions of the availability, illegality, and non-availability of dictionary servers.

What changes are there?The Release Notes for each MIT release of X11 specify the changes from the previous release.  The X Consortium tries very hard to maintain compatibility across releases.  In the few places where incompatible changes were necessary, details are given in the Release Notes.  Each X11 distribution site on the network also offers the Release Notes that go with the release they offer; the file typically can be found at the top of the distribution tree.[Stephen Gildea, 1/92]The comp.windows.x.intrinsics FAQ-Xt lists Xt differences among these versions.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  57)!

Where can I get patches to X11R5?The release of new public patches by the MIT X Consortium is announcedin the comp.windows.x.announce newsgroup.Patches themselves are available via ftp from export and from othersites from which X11 is available. They are now also distributed through the newsgroup comp.sources.x. Some source re-sellers may be including patches in their source distributions of X11.People without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server. It now has 23 patches for X11R5 [3/93].  Send to xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu the Subject linesend fixes #where # is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch.Here are a few complications:1) fix 5 is in four parts; you need to request "5a", "5b", "5c" and "5d" separately2) the file sunGX.uu, which was part of an earlier patch, was re-released with patch 7 [note: the file doesn't work with Solaris]3) fix 8 is in two parts: "8a" and "8b"4) fix 13 is in three parts: "13a", "13b", and "13c"5) fix 16 is in two parts: "16a" and "16b"6) fix 18 replaces the R5fix-test1 for the X Test Suite, which previously was optional7) fix 19 also needs PEXlib.tar.Z, which you can obtain from xstuffby asking for "PEXlib.uu.[1234]".8) fix 22 is in 9 parts, "22a" through "22i"----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  59)  What is the xstuff mail-archive?The xstuff server is a mail-response program. That means that you mail it a request, and it mails back the response.Any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. Thexstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything, so you can have several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help). The xstuff server treats the "Subject:" header line just like any other line of the message.The archives are organized into a series of directories and subdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each subdirectory has an index. The top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the subdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it.1) The command "help" or "send help" causes the server to send you a more detailed version of this help file.2) if your message contains a line whose first word is "index", then the server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive. Ifthere are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories, then the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level index. For example, you can say "send index fixes" (or "index fixes"). A message that requests an index cannot request data.3) if your message contains a line whose first word is "send", then thexstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. To name an item, you give its directory and its name. For example                send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9You may issue multiple send requests. The xstuff server contains many safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large amounts of data. The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixedamount of data each day. If the work queue contains more requests than the day's quota, then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day. Whenever the mailer is run to send its day's quota, it sends the requests out shortest-first.4) Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting return addresses.  If you use such a mailer, you won't get any response.  If you happen to know an explicit path, you can include a line like        path foo%bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.eduor        path bar!foo!frotzin the body of your message, and the daemon will use it.The xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu. If your mailer deals in "!" notation, try sending to {someplace}!mit-eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff.[based on information from the MIT X Consortium, 8/89, 4/90.]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  60)!

X11R5?Motif 1.2 is based on X11R5.Motif 1.1, available in source form from OSF as of August 1990, uses the "vanilla" X11R4 Intrinsics, where "vanilla" means "with just a few patches"; the file fix-osf which OSF distributes is obsoleted by MIT's patches 15-17.  The file fix-osf-1.1.1 distributed with the 1.1.1 version or its subsequent modification needs to be applied after MIT fix-18, though.Motif 1.1.1 to 1.1.3 will work with X11R5 if X11R5 is compiled with-DMOTIFBC; 1.1.4 and later should work with the vanilla R5, although there are some known new geometry-management problems.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  63)  Where can I get toolkits implementing OPEN LOOK?Sun's XView has a SunView-style API.

It turns a Sun 3/50 into a pseudo- X terminal; most of the overhead of the operating system is side-stepped, so it is fairly fast and needs little disk space.A similar approach is to run the regular X server by making /etc/inita shell script which does the minimal setup and then invokes Xsun, like thisexample script from mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.EDU:#! /bin/shexec >/dev/console 2>&1/etc/fsck -p /dev/nd0case $? in 0);; 4)/etc/reboot -q -n ;; 8)echo ND fsck failed - get help /etc/halt ;; 12)echo Interrupted /etc/reboot ;; *)echo Unknown error in reboot fsck - get help /etc/halt ;;esac/bin/dd if=/tmp-fs of=/dev/nd2 bs=512 count=128 >/dev/null 2>&1/etc/mount /dev/nd2 /tmp/etc/ifconfig le0 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 132.206.41.255/etc/mount -o ro apollo:/u2/x11/lib /local/lib/X11/etc/route add default 132.206.41.1 1 >/dev/nullset `/etc/ifconfig le0`exec /Xsun -once -multidisp -mux -query \\`(sh -vn </local/lib/X11/xdm-servers/$2 2>&1)`----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  76)  What terminal emulators other than xterm are available?PCS has rewritten xterm from scratch using a multi-widget approach thatcan be used by applications.

I stillhave the patches, however, I can no longer find the sources to whichthey applied ;-). I'd appreciate if some kind soul could send me a pointer towhere I could find the sources. Has anyone updated the patches for R5?(Richard? are you out there? pretty please?)Thanks in advance.manoj

A number of thesolutions provided through discussions here have been incorporated inthe code, so have a look! The full blurb has been posted tocomp.windows.x.announce.This post is in two parts. To unpack the source code, extract thearticles into file1 and file2 (for example). Use a text editor toremove leading and trailing text at the "---cut here---" markers(including the markers themselves). Next type "cat file1 file2 >file", then "uudecode file" and "zcat xrastool1.0.tar.Z | tar xvf -".Read the README file for instructions on how to proceed from there.Enjoy!DerekP.S. The source is also available for anon ftp from export.lcs.mit.eduin the contrib/ directory. If there is enough demand, a static binarywill be provided for those without the XView libraries or includefiles.-----------------------------------------------------------| Derek C.

We have severalNetwork General Sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems onseveral hundred subnets. These are good tools, but they are 1) heavy, 2) hard to find when you need one, 3) limited in their software expandibility,4) difficult to use to upload data for analysis, 5) cannot be remotelyoperated, and 6) cannot resolve names with DNS, requiring much manual manipulation of the name table.  We also sometimes use tcpdump, but we found it 1) too difficult for most people, 2) did not have enough information formany protocols, 3) could not be used interactively, 4) could not handleTCP streams and 5) could not read Sniffer files.  However, tcpdump did doa reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols, and could be easilymodified.  Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problemsby adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features.Tcpview has been tested on a DECstation 5000 and Sun 4 under Ultrix 4.2 andSunOS 4.1 respectively.  It should work on the same systems as tcpdump.It compiles with cc and gcc on the DEC and Sun.  To build tcpview you willneed Motif 1.1 or better.The following files are available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cac.washington.edu in /pub/networkingtcpview-1.0.tar.Ztcpview and tcpdump source codetcpview-1.0.sun.tar.ZSun4 binariestcpview-1.0.dec.tar.ZDEC Mips Ultrix 4.2 binariesWhat tcpview adds to tcpdump:- easier interface- enhanced protocol decoding- hex display of frame- capture based on time, number of frames, or user interrupt- can show ethernet addresses with manufacturer's name- ethernet address host table- can easily follow a stream, highlighting out-of-order frames- can send TCP data to an external file or filter for additionalprocessing.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------CHANGES TO TCPDUMP 2.2.1New features:Now reads and writes Network General Sniffer files.  When used with '-r', the file type will be automatically detected.Can now read in (and use) an SNMP MIB file.The hex format has been changed.New time options have been added.Options were added to allow viewing and processing of the data in TCP packets.Bugs were fixed in the relative TCP sequence numbers. (-S flag)New flags:-Rread Sniffer file.  Not usually needed, except for reading from stdin-tttprints delta times-ttttprints times relative to the first frame-Wwrite a Sniffer save file (use with -w)-xprint frame (minus link-level header) in hexdump format.

Since XDM is basically just an X-windowsclient, shouldn't I be able to run XDM on the DECnet protocol tower as well?My first inclination is that XDM is not your typical X client.

I'm running on an 8-bit display for which I've created acolormap and am using almost all of the colors.  I want to draw the linesin a drawing area widget -- a widget in which I'm displaying a bitmap usingXPutImage().  If doesn't matter if the lines I draw interactively stayaround when the window is refreshed.Currently, to draw interactively, I begin with:   /* drawIndex is an colortable index I reserve for the Foreground */   /* my_default_bg_color is the color index for the background of my image */   palette_colors[drawIndex].red =   palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].red;   palette_colors[drawIndex].green = palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].green;   palette_colors[drawIndex].blue =  palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].blue;   XStoreColors( myDisplay, my_cmap, &palette_colors[DrawIndex], 1);   XFlush( myDisplay);   XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXxor);   XSetForeground( myDisplay, gc, drawIndex);Then to draw I do:   XDrawLine( myDisplay, XtWindow( drawingArea1), gc, x1, y1, x2, y2);   XFlush( myDisplay);And when I'm all done, to return things to normal I do:   XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXcopy);What I'd like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse ofwhatever I'm drawing over.  Instead what happens is I get white lines.  Ifthe lines are over a white background - nothing shows up.  If the lines areover a black area - nothing shows up!  It's very strange.  But the GXxorfunction seems right - since if I do a rubber-banding box, it erases andredraws itself correctly (ie. not disturbing the underlying image).Any suggestions what I'm doing wrong?david

Apologies if this appearsfor the second time:Usually when I start up an application, I first get the window outlineon my display. I then have to click on the mouse button to actuallyplace the window on the screen. Yet when I specify the -geometry option the window appears right away, the properties specified bythe -geometry argument. The question now is:How can I override the intermediary step of the user having to specifywindow position with a mouseclick?

The more specific youare, the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing.  Withoutall the details, people who want to help you often have to guess -- if they areable to respond at all.Always mention what version of X you are using and where you got it from. If your server came from a different source as the rest of your X system,give details of that, too.  Give the machine type, operating system, and O/S version for both the client and server machine.  It may also be appropriate to mention the window manager, compiler, and display hardware type you are using.Then tell exactly what you are doing, exactly what happens, and whatyou expected/wanted to happen.  If it is a command that fails, include the exact transcript of your session in the message.  If a program you wrote doesn't work the way you expect, include as little of the source necessary (just a small test case, please!) for readers to reproduce the problem.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:   8)  What publications discussing X are available?The trade magazines (Unix World, Unix Review, Computer Language, etc.)are publishing more articles on X.  Two X-specific publications include:- O'Reilly and Associates publishes "The X Resource: A Practical Journal of the X Window System" (103 Morris St. #A, Sebastapol, CA 95472).  Editorial information: Adrian Nye, adrian@ora.com.- The X Journal is started bi-monthly publication September 1991 on a variety of X topics. Subscription information: The X Journal, Subscriber Services, Dept XXX, P.O. Box 3000, Denville, NJ 07834, USA. Editorial information: editors%topgun@uunet.uu.net.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:   9)  What are these common abbreviations/acronyms?Xt: The X Toolkit Intrinsics is a library layered on Xlib which provides the functionality from which the widget sets are built. An "Xt-based" program is an application which uses one of those widget sets and which uses Intrinsics mechanisms to manipulate the widgets.Xmu: The Xmu library is a collection of Miscellaneous Utility functionsuseful in building various applications and widgets.Xaw: The Athena Widget Set is the MIT-implemented sample widget setdistributed with X11 source.Xm: The OSF/Motif widget set from the Open Software Foundation; binarykits are available from many hardware vendors.Xhp (Xw): The Hewlett-Packard Widget Set was originally based on R2++, but several sets of patches exist which bring it up to R3, as it is distributedon the X11R4 tapes. Supplemental patches are available to use it with R4/R5.CLX: The Common Lisp X Interface is a Common Lisp equivalent to Xlib.XDMCP: The X Display Manager Protocol provides a uniform mechanism for a display such as an X terminal to request login service from a remote host.XLFD: The X Logical Font Description Conventions describes a standardlogical font description and conventions to be used by clients so that theycan query and access those resources.RTFM: Common expert-speak meaning "please locate and consult the relevant documentation -- Read the Forgotten Manual".UTSL: A common expression meaning "take advantage of the fact that you aren't limited by a binary license -- Use The Source, Luke".API: Application-Programmer Interface. The function calls, etc., ina programming library.BDF: Bitmap Distribution Format; a human-readable format for uncompiledX fonts.GUI: graphical user interface.UIL: the User Interface Language, part of OSF/Motif which lets programmers specify a widget hierarchy in a simple "outline" formWCL: the Widget Creation Language, a package which extends the understanding of the Xt resource format such that a widget hierarchy and actions on the widgets can be specified through the resources fileGIL: the file format put out by Sun's OpenWindows Developers Guide 3.0UIMS: User Interface Management System----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  10)  What is the ICCCM? (How do I write X-friendly applications?)The Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual is one of the official X Consortium standards documents that define the X environment. It describes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with other clients sharing the same server.  If you are writing X clients, you need to read and understand the ICCCM,  in particular the sections discussing the selection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window manager.  Get it either:- as part of the R4 distribution from MIT- in the later editions of the Scheifler/Gettys "X Window System" book- as an appendix in the new version of O'Reilly's Volume 0, "X ProtocolReference Manual." A version in old copies of their Volume 1 is obsolete.The version in the Digital Press book is much more readable, thanks to the efforts of Digital Press's editors to improve the English and the presentation.[from David Rosenthal, 10/90]- the ICCCM was updated for R5; updates are published in O'Reilly's"Programmer's Supplement for Release 5". The complete document is on the R5tapes.Alternate definition: the ICCCM is generally the M in "RTFM" and isthe most-important of the least-read X documents.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  11)  What is the X Consortium, and how do I join?The MIT X Consortium was formed in January of 1988 to further thedevelopment of the X Window System and has as its major goal the promotion of cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software interfaces at all layers in the X Window System environment.MIT's role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and administrative leadership required to make this work. Membership in the Consortium open to any organization.  There are two categories of membership, Member (for large organizations) and Affiliate (for smaller organizations).Most of the Consortium's activities take place via electronic mail, with meetings when required.  As designs and specifications take shape,interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations.  Typically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design, with others acting as close observers and reviewers.  Once a complete specificationis produced, it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortiumas a proposed standard.  The standards process typically includes public review (outside the Consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept.Your involvement in the public review process or as a Member or Affiliate of the Consortium is welcomed.Write to: Bob Scheifler, MIT X Consortium, Laboratory for Computer Science, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139.[For complete information see the XCONSORTIUM man page from the X11R4distribution, from which this information is adapted.] [2/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  12)  Just what are OPEN LOOK and Motif?OPEN LOOK and Motif are two graphical user interfaces (GUIs). OPEN LOOKwas developed by Sun with help from AT&T and many industry reviewers; Motif wasdeveloped by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) with input from many OSF members. OPEN LOOK is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide; there are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications.Motif includes an API specification; the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the one from OSF. However, there are other toolkits which can be used to produce programs which look and behave like OSF/Motif; one of these, ParcPlace's (formerly Solbourne's) OI, is a "virtual toolkit" which provides objects in thestyle of OPEN LOOK and Motif, at the user's choice.OPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT&T, comprising their OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications.[Thanks to Ian Darwin, ian@sq.com, 5/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  13)  Just what is OpenWindows?Open Windows (3.0) is a Sun product that encompasses: a window system that combines a NeWS and X11-compliant server (X/NeWS); a user-interface specification (OPEN LOOK) and a series of toolkits that implement it (includingthe SunView-like XView and the Xt-based OLIT); Xlib and Xt implementations; anda number of utilities (olwm window manager, filemgr, shelltool, etc.).[thanks to Frank Greco (fgreco@govt.shearson.COM), 8/90; 4/92] ----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  14)  Just what is DECWindows?DECWindows is a DEC product that encompasses: an X11 server; the XUI toolkit, including the Dwt widget set and UIL; Xlib and Xt implementations; a session manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager, dxcalendar, dxpsview, etc.).(At some point Motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.)[8/90] ----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  15)  What is PEX?PEX is the "PHiGS Extension to X".PHiGS stands for "Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System" and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation and manipulation of 3D graphics. Many platforms are capable of performing in hardware the computations involved in rendering 3D objects; the extension allows the client (PHiGS in this case) to take advantage of the specialized hardware for 3D graphics.Sun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely redistributable (copyright similar to the current X copyright) sampleimplementation.  Source and documentation are available in the R5 release.Several vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for their workstations and X terminals.[last modified 10/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  16)  What is "low-bandwidth X" (LBX)? XRemote? PPP? SLIP? CSLIP?There are several options for using X over serial lines:SLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IPpackets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years,and implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations.Most X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really ever uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per packet and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully so; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links). CSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the 40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn't do anything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help,but they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed data through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time).PPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-pointlinks over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation thanSLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial line management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for running normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wirestill needs compression somewhere to make it usable.XRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originallydeveloped by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition to using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP, XRemote removes redundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and using LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a pseudo-X server or "proxy" running on the host or in a terminal server.  There are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem:   (1)You don't *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't otherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly connected), and   (2)It reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes thathave to cross the serial interface, and   (3)In addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for blocks to compress.LBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on astandard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using NCD's XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBXwill go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information (e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps, etc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The hope is to have a Standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample implementation available in R6.Additional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on howLBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.eduin contrib/ in the following files:        XRemote-slides.ps               slides describing XRemote        XRemote-LBX-diffs.ps            more slides describing some of LBX[information provided by Jim Fulton, jim@ncd.com; 7/92]There is also a set of slides on export from Jim Fulton's talk atthe 7th MIT X Technical Conference.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  17)  TOPIC: USING X IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  18)! What are all these different window managers?The window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of theX window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there isno single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout,decoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order(generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM):wm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3uwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed, although it is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape.twm (old): Tom's Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window managers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in are-parenting window manager. awm: the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offerssome features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managerscwm: cwm is part of the Andrew system. rtl: Siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlapand resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size.dxwm: Digital's dxwm is part of the DECwindows offeringhpwm: HP's window manager offers a 3D look; it is a precursor of mwmmwm: the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkittekwm: Tektronix's window manager offering olwm (Sun): olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the StyleGuide functionalityolwm (AT&T): dittogwm: Bull's Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-inLisp interpreter. Version 1.7h (10/91) is on the R5 contrib tape; 1.7n is onavahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. [3/93]m_swm: the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tapepswm: Sun's PostScript-based pswm is part of the OpenWindows releaseswm: Solbourne's swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multipleGUI support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comesfrom the resources filetwm (new): MIT's new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a reworkedtwm and is the basis for several derivatives, including the one on the R5 tapevtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm, with asingle-root window implementation; it is based on the R4 twm and is availableon archive servers. A new version, vtwm-5.0, is based on R5.9 and is available from export. [3/92]tvtwm: Tom's Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the R4 twmand provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. It isavailable on archive serversolvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to Sun's olwm. It is available on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export.mvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF's mwm. A beta versionis floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a source license to OSF/Motif 1.1.3 [3/92].NCDwm: the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look XDSwm: the window manager local to Visual Technology's terminals ctwm: Claude Lecommandeur's (lecom@sic.epfl.ch) modification of the R5 twm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm; source is on export.Version 2.2.2 [2/93] also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm.vuewm: HP's MWM-based window manager offers configurable workspaces.4Dwm: SGI's enhanced MWMpiewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  19)  Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager (sic)?It needn't.  What is probably happening is that you are running your window manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X session runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your window manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead, run the window manager inthe background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like:exec xterm -name Login -rv -iconicor any special client of your devising which exits on some user action.Your X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window, whether or not you kill or restart your window manager.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  20)  Can I save the state of my X session, like toolplaces does?Although no known window manager directly supports such a feature --which may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming thegeometry and WM_COMMAND of each application (but olvwm may have something close) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are looking for, although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces. Look for the application "xplaces" on an archive-server near you. There are several versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage.[10/90]Some new pseudo session-managers such as HP's vuewm provide for the saving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-runningapplications and the resource database. [Bjxrn Stabell (bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no); 3/93.] ----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  21)  How do I use another window manager with DEC's session manager?DEC's session manager will start dxwm up by default. To override this, add to your .Xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname:sm.windowManagerName:   /wherever/usr/bin/X11/your_favorite_wm----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  22)  How do I change the keyboard auto-repeat rate?You can turn auto-repeat on or off by using "xset r on|off". The Xprotocol, however, doesn't provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which isa capability not supported by all systems.Some servers running on systems that support this, however, may providecommand-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. If you have control over server start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the server with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the Xsun server from MIT with the options "-ar1 350 -ar2 30" to reduce the sensitivity of the keyboard.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  23)  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string?There is no method of arranging for a particular string to beproduced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client, which is useful for moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and does not do "macro expansion."Some (few) clients, including xterm and several X-based editors, accept a translation resource such as:xterm*VT100.Translations: #override \\<Key>F1: string("setenv DISPLAY unix:0")which permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locallywithin an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. To include controlcharacters in the string, use \\nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of thecontrol character you want to include.Window managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; norhas a special "remapper" client been made available.----------------------------------------------------------------------David B.

Of cause, the R4-versiondid not know about the xpTableWidgetClass (we used tableWidgetClass instead - caught from the net in times of R3) and XpTableChildPosition (formerly XtTblPosition).Since compiling with R5, the program causes a zero width or height error(on sparc-stations). The trouble-shooter is the (re)computation of themodel_init_table - table widget: though its childs (label and asciiText widgets) exist, XtQueryGeometry returns a prefered width and height of zero. Thus the following asignment cannot perform anything else but set the width and height of the newly created widget to zero. No wonder XtPopup or XtManage- Child create zero width or height errors (dependent on whether width and height of the shell widget are set in the resource file or not).Question: Does anyone know, why XtQueryGeometry returns so low preferedvalues when working on table widgets or perhaps whatto do about?I'll be happy, if someone is able to help me.

It should error out if the cell is non-shareable.But life would be much easier if I could just detect theread-only/shareable stuff directly...Any ideas?Noel (ngorelic@speclab.cr.usgs.gov)

The makefile will be arranged to execute aX       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name ofX       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followedX       by a digit, followed by '.sh'.XX       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry mustX       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames.XX    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should beX       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files,X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If thisX       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks.XX    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected.X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers.XX    7) The program must be of original work.

All other uses must receive prior permission in writing Xfrom both Landon Curt Noll and Larry Bassel.XXABOUT THIS FILE:XX    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries toX    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short).XX    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments aboutX    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules areX    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.XX    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.XXXWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:XX    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.cX    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.XX    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI CX    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.XXXHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:XX    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  SeeX    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.XX    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entriesX    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one yearX    might be 'old' the next year.XX    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically applyX    a number of tests to an entry:XX* look at the original sourceX* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCIIX* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' linesX* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' linesX* run it through a C beautifierX* examine the algorithmX* lint itX* compile itX* execute itXX    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has beenX    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.XX    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certainX    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for theX    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well asX    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, givenX    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry thatX    does something interesting when you run it.XX    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leaveX    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real lifeX    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer requestX    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of theX    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.XX    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us knowX    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuseX    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to theX    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends toX    annoy more than amuse.XX    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entriesX    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to useX    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)XX    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes makeX    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularlyX    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen someX    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.XX    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims thatX    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better offX    documenting it.  Noting "this entry sometimes prints the 4th powerX    of a prime by mistake" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctlyX    working entry is best.XXXOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:XX    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  WeX    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor testsX    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as farX    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.XX    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:XX#define d defineX#d foo   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define fooXXint i;Xj;   <-- don't use such implicit type declarationXint k;XX    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.XX    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type.X    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed:XXint i;Xchar *c;Xi[c];   <--- use c[i] insteadX(i+3)["string"];   <--- use "string"[i+3] insteadXX    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number ofX    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide varietyX    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list areX    not portable and must not be used:XX* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variableX* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variableX* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list argX* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list argX* performing arithmetic on va_list variablesX* using va_list as a structure or unionXX    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.XX    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.XX    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While someX    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not.XX    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entriesX    must not assume that it returns an int.XX    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they doX    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that peopleX    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look forX    programs that are compact, and are instructional.XX    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.XX    We tend to dislike programs that:XX* are very hardware specificX* are very OS or Un*x version specificX     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specificX      code is likely not to be)X* dump core or have compiler warningsX     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)X* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*xX* abusing the build file to get around the size limitX* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphsX* are longer than they need to beX* are similar to previous winnersX* are identical to previous losers  :-)XX    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering theX    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your programX    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.XX    The build file should not be used to try and get around the sizeX    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out,X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order toX    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feelX    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better offX    if you show some amount of restraint.XX    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impactX    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to getX    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.XX    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blobX    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical CX    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a thirdX    version of the same program that is formatted in an interestingX    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!XX    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claimX    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicatingX    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)X    know of a smaller one!XX    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries thatX    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don'tX    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't dependX    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.XX    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries andX    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X clientX    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and theX    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyoneX    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  NotX    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (orX    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  BetterX    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.XX    X client entries should not to depend on particular items onX    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required linesX    in the ---remark--- section.XX    We like programs that:XX* are as concise and small as they need to beX* do something at least quasi-interestingX* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)X* are portableX* are unique or novel in their obfuscation styleX* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATIONX* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)XX    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, yourX    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in severalX    areas really does help.XX    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments inX    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had toX    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.XX    Be creative!XXXENTRY FORMAT:XX    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request yourX    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about theX    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)XX    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how toX    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning thatX    is found in mkentry.c:XXThis program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  EveryXattempt has been made to make sure that this program producesXan entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,Xwhere this program differs from the contest rules, theXcontest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with theXcontest rules before submitting an entry.XX    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to checkX    the entry against the size rules.XX    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints aboutX    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below)XX    The following is a sample entry:XX---entry---Xrule:1993Xfix:nXtitle:chonglabXentry:0Xdate:Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993Xhost:Un*x v6, pdp11/45X2.9BSD, pdp11/70X---remark---X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.XX    It is likely not to win a prize.

If this case applies, it would be be helpfulX    if you did one of the following:XX* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.XX* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:XXcc prog.c -o special_nameneed special binaryXX    or  rm -f special_src.cneed special sourceXcp prog.c special_src.cXcc special_src.c -o special_nameXX    or  rm -f special_buildneed special buildXtail +4 build > special_buildXsh < special_buildXX* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of X  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You X  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.XX    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoidX    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You shouldX    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  ThisX    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.XX    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  WeX    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If theX    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.XX    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode themX    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,X    then skip the ---info--- section.XX    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information thatX    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, anX    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sampleX    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include aX    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for aX    'hints' file.XX    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  ForX    example, info files may provide sample input or detailedX    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,X    the entry should not require them exist.XX    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid nameX    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,X    say so in the ---remark--- section.XX    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If theyX    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, sayX    so in the ---remark--- section.XX    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry hasX    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry shouldX    have entry number 0.XX    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entryX    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of theX    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren'tX    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:XX...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges(not the address forXjudges@toad.com submitting entries)X    X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:XXThr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993XX    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  TheX    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:XXdate -u "+%a %h %d %T 19%y"Xdate -u | sed -e 's/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/'Xsh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e "s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/"'Xsh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e "s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/"'Xsh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e "s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/"'XX    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, setX    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'.X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry numberX    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to beX    replaced.XXXJUDGING PROCESS:XX    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.XX    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email messageX    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:XX---entry--- sectionXall ---author--- sectionsXall ---info--- sectionsX---build--- sectionX---program--- sectionXany other text, including the Email message headersXX    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sureX    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry wasX    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from theX    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process isX    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.XX    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particularX    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you areX    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of findingX    out in the end, who won and where they were from.XX    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make allX    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winningX    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not evenX    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCCX    winners at talks)XX    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to theX    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to giveX    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented theirX    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  WeX    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.XX    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that doesX    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in theX    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.XX    A reading consists of a number of actions:XX* reading the ---entry--- sectionX* reading the uudecoded ---build--- sectionX* reading the uudecoded ---program--- sectionX* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if anyX* passing the source thru the C pre-processorX    shipping over any #include filesX* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the sourceX* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processorX    shipping over any #include filesXX    In later rounds, other actions are performed:XX* linting the sourceX* compiling/building the sourceX* running the programX* performing misc tests on the source and binaryXX    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entriesX    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because itX    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to formX    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.X    An entry often will compete in several categories.XX    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entriesX    we receive.  A typical category list might be:XX* best small one line programX* best small programX* strangest/most creative source layoutX* most useful obfuscated programX* best game that is obfuscatedX* most creatively obfuscated programX* most deceptive C codeX* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)X* best abuse of ANSI CX* worst abuse of the rulesX* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>XX    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are soX    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.XX    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks ofX    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it intoX    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do notX    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, isX    less clear cut.XX    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat outX    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it isX    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course, X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!XX    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), aX    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contestX    rules in some way.XX    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes suchX    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, theX    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.XXXANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:XX    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior toX    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.XX    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:XX    comp.lang.c  comp.unix.wizardsalt.sourcesXX    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the followingXX    comp.sources.d  alt.sources.dmisc.miscX    comp.sources.misc  comp.windows.xXX    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  SeeX    below for details.XX    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners X    have appeared in books ("The New Hackers Dictionary") and on T-Shirts.XX    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-)XXXFOR MORE INFORMATION:XX    You may contact the judges by sending Email to the following address:XX...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges(not the address forXjudges@toad.com submitting entries)XX    Questions and comments about the contest are welcome.XX    One may obtain a copy of the current rules, guidelines or mkentryX    program.

These  are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the  performance of your workstation.  Well, more hardware isn't always an option, and I wonder if more  hardware is always even a necessity.  This "FAQ" list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different  people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X  Windows on your workstation, WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE.  Performance is a highly subjective issue.  The individual user must  balance `speed' versus `features' in order to come to a personal  decision.  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many  subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts.  This document is specifically concerned with X.  There are of course  many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation.  However, they are outside the scope of this document.    [ People seriously interested in the whole area of system    performance, might want to look at the O'Reilly Nutshell Handbook    "System Performance Tuning" by Mike Loukides.  IMHO, it contains a    well-written, comprehensive treatment of system performance.  I'm    unaware of any other similar books.  --ed.]-----------------Table of Contents-----------------  0.

If you are reading a copy of this FAQ which is more than a few  months old (see the "Last-modified" date above) you should probably  locate the latest edition, since the information may be outdated.  If you do not know how to get those newsgroups and/or your site does  not receive them and/or this article has already expired, you can  retrieve this FAQ from an archive site.  There exist several usenet FAQ archive sites.  To find out more about  them and how to access them, please see the "Introduction to the  news.answers newsgroup" posting in news.answers.  The main FAQ archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].  This document  can be found there in /pub/usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups.  If  you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can retrieve it by  sending a mail message to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the  command "send usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups" in the message body.-----------------------------What about the "Other X FAQ"?-----------------------------  David B. Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and  well written "comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions" document.  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates  on performance.  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4".  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).---------------Window Managers---------------  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this  point, most respondents have agreed upon "twm" as the best candidate  for a speedy window manager.   A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,  is turning off unnecessary things like "zooming" and "opaque move".  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)  I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.------------The X Server------------Which Server?- - - - - - -  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute  to less paging.           [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.  You can expect to get "*very* large speedups in the server" by not  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial  compilers on the market.Locking the Server into RAM?- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help  performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone  who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.    [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com),      Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be),      Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ]Starting your Server- - - - - - - - - - -  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!    Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of  why this works, which I have summarized here:    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself    sorted out before the clients start up.    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources    being fetched, programs initializing state and "databases" and so    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this    initialization is done ("The process has reached a steady state"),    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your    workstation's limited resources  This is most definitely a "Your Mileage May Vary" situation, as there  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients  you are starting, etc.  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &  I've experimented with:(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &  I've even tried:(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down    into a "steady state" before the sleep expired and all my clients    were launched. ]  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.Fonts- - -  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts  your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer  fonts will be loaded by the server.      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13  in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since  I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.About the Resources File- - - - - - - - - - - - -    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)  One suggestion:    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N    [ The "comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions" FAQ contains    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.    --ed.]    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files    with the same name.    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following  benefits:    - Easier to maintain / more usable.    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort       through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.  It also has drawbacks:    - the application that you are interested in has to load an      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to      make that much of a performance difference, and you might      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an      application's resource database, you just need to re-run the      application without having to "xrdb" again.    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*      provide any error message when it encountered the C style      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted      processing the resource file.      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef      COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this      method of resource management.    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my  .Xdefaults file, and to use the "separate resources files" method for  clients that I seldom use.Define Your Display Properly- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to   "<hostname>:0.0", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you  should set your DISPLAY variable to "unix:0.0" or ":0.0".  By doing this  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further  explanation of how to properly set your display name.  "I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when  the DISPLAY isn't set specially."      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.  I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT  will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if  you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]-------Clients-------  If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think  carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there  a smaller clock program than xclock?  Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large  they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients  (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]  I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject  of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif  clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in  more than one toolkit library.  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client  programs would work best together in that environment.  [Thanks to: Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET),      Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk | sinclair@uk.ac.gla.dcs) ]A Better Clock for X- - - - - - - - - - -1) xcuckoo   suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk)   available: on export.lcs.mit.edu   Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.

Extensively configurable.  it can be made to look   very much like MIT oclock, or mostly like xclock purely by changing   resources.

I suspect that  xterm is one of the most used clients at many, if not most sites.  Laziness?  Isn't there a better terminal emulator available?  See below.  If you must use xterm, you can try reducing the number of saveLines  to reduce memory usage.  [ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com),   Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ]1) Xvt   suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) :   available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z   "...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm, then get   hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as   xterm is rather a hog! "   This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.  You don't have to   rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current   version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that   there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any   yet.   UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with   Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He   questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For   instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling   speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap   bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm   may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard   numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text   segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.   As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it   made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets   brought into memory.   So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of   xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary.   If you can provide some hard data, I'd like to see it.

"I also have my own terminal emulator.  Its major lack is   scrollback, but some people like it anyway."Tuning your client- - - - - - - - - -  Suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster.  From Scott Barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding Motif  Text Field Widgets:    I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets, I    was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes,    particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was    going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource    XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget    (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the    widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference    on a [slower system].  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots  of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor  embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server  requests?-------------------------Miscellaneous Suggestions-------------------------Pretty Pictures- - - - - - - -  Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.  - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server    is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)  - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm    conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see    people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.    I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by    having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.  - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate    that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.      [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) for reminding me of this one. --ed.]A Quicker Mouse- - - - - - - -  Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen  when you move your mouse.  I use "xset m 3 10" in my .xinitrc file,  which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of  the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.  Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for  fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different  mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.    e.g. (for twm) :      menu "mouse settings" {        "Mouse Settings:"f.title"  Very Fast"! "xset m 7 10 &""  Normal (Fast)"! "xset m 3 10 &""  System Default (Un-Accelerated)"! "xset m default &""  Glacial"! "xset m 0 10 &"      }Programming Thoughts- - - - - - - - - - -  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :    To speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of    things you can do.  Some that stick out:    - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual      buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager      widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.    - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.    - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.      (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)    - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE      difference.    - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable      one.  Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :    Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based    applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying    out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some    tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the    differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)  [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]  Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :  - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.    Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but    they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the    blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most    cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to    run through it's event-loop again and again.  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.    This "Gfx Context Switching" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed    again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the    connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).Say What!?- - - - - -   Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:  David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :    How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs    on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your    machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the    same operation between client and server.  I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received  the following confirmation...  Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se):    I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big    difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage    and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This    helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was    essential when I only had 8 MB.  Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) :    [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as    your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a    major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in    absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.  Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :    Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle, X's    cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate    doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they    are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your    action.    The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2    cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going    over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved    buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing    even fewer context switches.----------------------------Other Sources of Information----------------------------  Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System  Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read.  Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com):    A lot more tips on performance are in the paper "Improving X    Application Performance" by Chris D. Peterson and Sharon Chang, in    Issue 3 of The X Resource.    An earlier version of this paper appeared in the Xhibition 1992    conference proceedings.    This paper is absolutely essential reading for X programmers.--------------Author & Notes--------------  This list is currently maintained by Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca)  Suggestions, corrections, or submission for inclusion in this list  are gladly accepted.

As you know, there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from MIT's X11R5 release -- Xsi and Ximp. Our original implementation of the toolkituses Xsi.Our toolkit manages each character's size based on our own font management system.In order to do that, the 'wchar_t' typed character strings must be decomposedto character sets. This means that if one wchar_t type compound string with ASCII and Kanji mixed, for example, is given, each element of the wchar_tarray must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layoutand application environment's locale. In this case if the locale is 'japanese',each wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1, jisx0208 or so.We need a function to do this. The function must check how many charactersfrom the top are the same character set and what the character set is.We could not find any public X11R5 function to do that and inevitably, usedXsi's internal functions to construct that function. The following is thesource code of that function 'decomposeCharacterSet()'.//I18N.h// This may look like C code, but it is really -*- C++ -*-// $Id: I18N.h,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:24 iima Exp iima $#ifndef _I18N_H#define _I18N_H#include <X11/Xlib.h>extern int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,/* IN */ int wc_len,/* IN */ char *buf,/* OUT */ int *buflen,/* IN/OUT */ int *scanned_len,/* OUT */ char **charset);/* OUT */extern XmString wcharToXmString(const wchar_t *wc_str);extern XmStringCharSet charsetOfWchar(const wchar_t wc);#endif /* _I18N_H *///I18N.cc/* $Id: I18N.cc,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:05 iima Exp $ */#include <stdlib.h>#include <X11/Xlibint.h>#include <Xm/Xm.h>#include "I18N.h"extern "C" {#include <X11/wchar.h>#define _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset XXX_XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset#define _Xmbfscs XXX_Xmbfscs#define _Xmbctidtocsid XXX_Xmbctidtocsid#include "Xlocaleint.h"#undef _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset#undef _Xmbfscs#undef _Xmbctidtocsid    extern int _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(XLocale, const wchar_t*, int, char*, int*, int*, int*);    extern Charset *_Xmbfscs(XLocale, _CSID);    extern _CSID _Xmbctidtocsid(XLocale, _CSID);};int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,/* IN */  int wc_len,/* IN */  char *buf,/* OUT */  int *buf_len,/* IN/OUT */  int *scanned_len,/* OUT */  char **charset)/* OUT */{    XLocale xlocale = _XFallBackConvert();    int ctid;    int status;    Charset *xcharset;        status = _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(xlocale, wc_str, wc_len, buf,       buf_len, scanned_len, &ctid);    if (status == Success) {xcharset = _Xmbfscs(xlocale, _Xmbctidtocsid(xlocale, ctid));*charset = (xcharset) ? xcharset->cs_name : NULL;    }    else*charset = NULL;    return status;}----------------An included file above, "Xlocaleint.h", is also Xsi internal and we copiedthe file to the toolkit directory and compiled.A serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application onour HP machine with its OS version of HP-UX9.01.When we tried to link an application based on our toolkit,link errors occured saying that the following functions are missing:    _Xmbctidtocsid (code)    _Xmbfscs (code)    _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset (code)    _XFallBackConvert (code)We had used MIT release version of X11R5 and its Xsi implementation untilHP-UP9.0 and ran applications successfully. One of the reasons to use Xsi was thatbecause HP did not release HP's X11R5 until the OS 9.0 and we had no way to know how HP's R5 would be implemented. We had hoped Xsi's popularity and used its internal functions. The HP's linker complains that there are no Xsi internal functions implemented.We observe from HP's libX11.a, they used some Ximp implementation but we arenot sure if they used MIT's vanilla Ximp version or their own version of Ximp andtherefore, finding just counter part functions in MIT's Ximp for Xsi does notseem to lead us a solution.My question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like'decomposeCharacterset()' listed above. Is there any function to checkcharacter set of each element of wchar_t type strings depending on locales?If it is a public function, that is perfect but even if it is not, wewant to use any internal functions in HP's X11R5 as we did for MIT's R5.In order to render a 'wchar_t' type string, there must be some machineryto judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected forthe string. We have no way to find out that without any HP's X11R5 source files. We want to know how we can use that for our goal. Any help or comments would be highly appreciated.I also appreciate if anyone tell me about Ximp treating around this areaeven if it is not HP's implementation.Thank you.--Takeshi Inoueinoue@crd.yokogawa.co.jpYokogawa Electric CorporationOpen Systems Laboratory0422(52)5557

But I seem to have no control over the length of this field.In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters,in some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by PANEL_MAX_VALUE! As I understand, PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH, which controlsnumber of characters to be displayed in text items, doesn'twork in the case of slider, despite the fact that <panel.h>contains the following bit:/* Panel_multiline_text_item, Panel_numeric_text_item, * Panel_slider_item and Panel_text_item attributes */PANEL_NOTIFY_LEVEL= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_ENUM, 152),PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_INT, 182),which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders.But 1) setting this attribute gives nothing, and 2) xv_get'tingthis attribute gives warning: Bad attribute, and returns value 0.Strange thing is that DEC's port of XView gives plenty of spacein a text fields, but not Sun's Xview...Can someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me,and clear this problem? Any help is very much appreciated.Yuriyuri@uk.ac.hw.phy

In fact chipmunk is complete VLSI design tool (schematic editor, layout editor, LVS, DRC...). The schematic editor  itself iscalled LOG.The second one I heard of is called 'OCTTOOLS'. It is also a complete VLSIpackage. The fully uncompressed release takes about 130Mb of disk space.  Itshould be available at Berkley.That's all I got so far.Mark__________________________________________________________________________ _____Mark NiederbergerEmail:   mniederb@itr.ch__________________________________________________________________________ _____
