If not, please do so before posting this misinterpretation again.>It refers to the right of the people to organize a militia, not for individuals >to carry handguns, grenades, and assault rifles.  The Supreme Court seems to disagree with you -- they have stated that"the people" is a term of art refering to an individual right, andhave explicitly mentioned the second amendment as an example.I quote:  "... 'the people' seems to have been a term of art employed in  select parts of the Constitution.  The Preamble declares that the  Constitution is ordained, and established by 'the people of the  the U.S.'  The Second Amendment protects the right of the people  to keep and bear Arms ...."- Supreme Court of the U.S.,  U.S. v. Uerdugo-Uriquidez (1990).Furthermore, in the Miller decision, they only permitted prosecutionfor possession of a sawed-off shotgun because the defense had notpresented testimony and they therefore accepted the argument of thegovernment that such weapons have no military value -- they held thatthe amendment protected the individual right to possess militaryweapons. Unfortunately, no second amendment case has successfullygotten to the court in fifty years. However, that does not change theinterpretation.Furthermore, it appears that others disagree with you as well, vis: "The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept,  and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the  United States, as well as its interpretation by every major  commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratifi-  cation, indicates that what is protected is an individual right  of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner."   - Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the     Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate,     97th Congress, Second Session ( February 1982 )You might rightfully ask "well then, what does that first bit aboutmilitias mean?"Well, "militia" in historical context basically means the whole of theadult males of the country. (Indeed, the U.S. Code still defines"militia" as all armed men over the age of 17).   "The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting    in concert for the common defense ....  And ... these men were    expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of    the kind in common use at the time."- Supreme Court of the United States,  U.S. v. Miller (1939).The reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationalebehind the amendment, which was this: by depending on the people tobear arms in defense of the country, no centralization of militarypower could ever occur which would permit tyranny -- in short, thegovernment would remain perpetually in fear of the people, rather thanthe other way around.   "No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.  The strongest reason   for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last   resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government."     - Thomas Jefferson, Proposal Virginia Constitution, June 1776       1 Thomas Jefferson Papers, 334 (C. J. Boyd, Ed., 1950).   "And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not   warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of   resistance ?  Let them take arms ... The tree of liberty must be   refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants."     - Thomas Jefferson (letter to William S. Smith, 1787, in       Jefferson, On Democracy 20, S. Padover, ed., 1939).   "Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed;   as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe.  The supreme   power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword;   because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute   a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on   any pretense, raised in the United States."     - Noah Webster, "An Examination into the Leading Principles       of the Federal Constitution" (1787), in Pamphlets on the       Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888).You may disagree with the second amendment, and wish that it berepealed, but please do not pretend that it isn't there and that itdoesn't mean what it says. You might argue that conditions havechanged and that it should no longer be present, but you can't imagineit away.I could fill a book with detailed argumentation. Many have already.However, none of this has anything to do with cryptography.  Lets getit out of here.

The Jews who found themselves alone againstRome on Masada faced a future which was infinitely bleaker than the onefaced by the Branch Davidians. The latter, in reality, would likelyhave been charged with weapons violations and other sorts of crimes.Most of them would have likely gotten off entirely.

But regardless, most of the people, andcertainly all of the children, would have been allowed to leave, and ifthey so chose, join another cult.The Jews on Masada well understood their likely fate from what hadalready happened. Had they surrendered, the men of fighting age wouldprobably have been put to death, perhaps crucified.  The women andchildren would have been enslaved. None of them would have been likelyto practice their religion again.I understand that Howell/Koresh and perhaps others will argue that thefate of the Branch Davidians was "equally" onerous and that they werefighting for religious freedom.

 39Message-ID: <1r2efqINN6ml@uwm.edu>NNTP-Posting-Host: 129.89.9.13A couple of questions for you firearms law experts out there:  Question #1According to the NRA/ILA state firearms lawbook, in Wisconsin it is'unlawful for any person except a peace officer to go armed* with a "concealed and dangerous weapon."  There is no statutory provision forobtaining a lixense or permit to carry a concealed weapon.'*  Jury instructions indicate that 'to go armed' one must have a firearmon one's person or within his immediate control and available for use.Does this mean that open carry is allowed?  If so, just how 'open' does ithave to be?  Would an in the pants holster be considered concealing?  Whatif one had their jacket on and it partially covered the weapon?  Also,is there any way to be allowed to carry concealed, or is it just not allowed,period? Question #2As I understand it, in Evanston, IL, they have a ordinance banning handguns.Is there any way to get around this provision?  What would the penalty ifyou were found out be?  What if you used said handgun in a defensive shootingin your apartment there?  How would the city law apply to your impending trial for the shooting?Also, what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons?  Short barreledshotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available, either that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie Colt, Marlin).  One more thing, what is the chance of getting a CCW permit in IL without beingrich or famous or related to the mayor?Please send replies via E-Mail, as things seem to be piling up around t.p.ga little faster than I can handle.

 10For those of you interested, I just finished talking with a representative of Senator Bob Krueger's reelection campaign about his position on the RTKBA.  Krueger was appointed by the  Democratic Governor of Texas to complete Lloyd Bentsen's unexpired term.The representative said that Senator Krueger did not have a position and would only comment on specific legislation that was pending.  No comment was available on the various versions of the Brady Bill.Be warned and vote accordingly.

 14   There's only one way I know of to tell an AR-15 from an M-16.   Pick it up, hold it about a foot from your face and look closely   at the saftey lever.  If it has two positions, its an AR-15, if   it has three, its an M-16.  There are numerous internal differences   as well, but since one would have to field strip the weapon to see   them, they are not valid in this discussion.  So, in conclusion,   there is very little external differences to distinguish an AR-15   from an M-16 except at close (very close) range.

 48Greetings,    Specious reasoning alert!  Sorry folks, I don't like gun controltoo much, but this is just too crazy.    1)  The main gun control law is similar to (or even BASED ON) aGerman gun control law.    2)  Germany was Controlled With Evil Nazi's at the time.    3)  Nazi's are bad.    Therefore gun control is bad!  (If this seems reasonable to you,try reading it as GunControlIsANaziPlot!  That's pretty much what it'ssaying.)    Look, let's try to beat gun control with reason and sense, not bytrying to appeal to emotions, and threatening conspiracies.  DenounceGCA '68 as wrong because it's WRONG, not because it's based off of alaw from someone else's government.    As for the 'Lots Of Brave Men Died Fighting Nazi's, So Their LawsHave No Place On Our Books!'  Well, lots of brave men died fightingEngland.  Wanna bet we've got lots of English laws on our books?  Oh,but they're our ALLIES now, so everything's hunky-dory.  I'm *VERY*sure that the GCA is not the only law that we have on the books whichis similar, or even based on, a law on the german books.  HOWEVER,that does not give invalidation in and of itself.    WE, THE PEOPLE, must state that we find the law unappealing andcontrary to our freedom.  We must use logic, and reason, and compellingarguments.  To use emotion, and appeal to fear is to lower yourselvesto the level of your enemies.    A side issue...  When talking about the Amendments, it bothersme to see people acting as if they empower them, but require noresponsibility from them.  Free speech also assumes restraint, wellarmed militia expects well TRAINED militia, the right to vote expectsthe citizen to try to become educated enough to make a reasonabledecision.  You are not granted these rights without any responsibilityto the society that offers them.  You have a responsibility in return,and it's to do more than bitch.                                                     --  Morgan Schweers-- Hacker, Furry, SFFan, gamer, writer, MUDder, climber.  24 hours isn't enough!mrs@netcom.com   | Finger mrs@netcom.com or mrs@mcafee.com for my PGP 2.1 key!|New chrome grass! \\ B1 S4 a b g j++! k l? p r- s t+ u v- w+ x y- z, approx.__/Low-level D&D monsters practicing war games @ night.

 21Fact:  Both Janet Reno and Bill Clinton have admitted responsibility,       even grief, over the deaths in Waco.Fact:  Regardless of who started the fire, there are more than enough       things on tape to make a civil rights case against these two.       Cruel and unusual punishment (dying tortured rabbits on tape?)       come to mind.  Fact:  It is a federal felony to infringe civil rights under color of       law; where death is involved, this offense carries a penalty       of life in prison.Fact:  Impeachment is allowable for "high crimes and misdemeanors."       Anything that's a federal felony should qualify.Conclusion:  We have NO CHOICE, if we are an honest people, but to              impeach Mr. Clinton, and remove Reno from office.Glenn R.

(BTW - they didn'thonestly count the latter either, but let's not quibble.)  Theytry to claim that comparison is between the costs of self-defenseand the benefits, but they're wrong.This comparison doesn't measure the costs of self-defense and itdoesn't measure the benefits either.  For example, the goal is not tokill the attacker, whatever your relationship to him, but to stop him.While the number of killings may be proportional to the number ofstops, it isn't equal.Anyone who confuses that comparison with an honest evaluationis either lying or....-andy--

 99Here is a press release from the White House. President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A To: National Desk Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100   WASHINGTON, April 20 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Following areremarks by President Clinton in a question and answer sessionwith the press (Part 2 of 2):     Go ahead, Sarah.     Q  There are two questions I want to ask you.  Thefirst is, I think that they knew very well that the children did nothave gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chancebecause this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it wasvery dangerous to the children and they could not have survivedwithout gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn'tthose people have a right to practice their religion?     THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing theirreligion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they hadviolated federal laws, any number of them.     Q  What federal laws --     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can'tanswer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that thewhole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; theywere convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult butit would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one ofthe things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details ofthis because I don't know -- but one of the things that they werespeculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast thatthe windows might have been opened and some of the gas might haveescaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.     They also knew, Sarah, that there was an undergroundcompound -- a bus buried underground where the children could besent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that ifthe children were not released immediately outside that the humanething would be done and that the children would be sent someplacewhere they could be protected.     In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learnedyesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gaswas supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masksthemselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if theyall had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in anonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.     MS. MYERS:  Last question.     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --     Q  Could you tell us whether or not you ever askedJanet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when youlearned about the actual fire and explosion what went through yourmind during those horrendous moments?     THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they hadconsidered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said --and, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in thepublic -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said thatthe people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issuesconcluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there wouldbe tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime inthe future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they wereright or wrong, of course, we will never know.     What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw thebuilding burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediateconcern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they wereescaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up.That's the first thing I wanted to know.     Thank you.     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was aJanet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn'thave a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn'tgo over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which Itake responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and Isigned off on the general decision and giving her the authority tomake the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time hadelapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said,if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you.And I do support her.     She is not ultimately responsible to the Americanpeople; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in anappropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think aswell as she could have.     Thank you.  (Applause.) -30-

 11Ah yes, I see a few liberal weenies have come out of the woodworkto defend the burning of the children. Probably drooled all over themselveswhile watching the TV coverage.Probably had a few like that in Nazi Germany, as well.Oh yeah, ATF/FBI now claims, according the the media, that there area few survivors. The number seems to vary minute by minute.

In fact, it is oftenchosen (besides its other merits) because it shoots like a revolver doesbasically.  It can limit the training time (read budget $$$) due to thefact there are no 'external' safties other than the trigger, hence lesstraining time required. Smith & Wesson (among other types) are chosen due to the fact tahtthey do have the external safties (hammer drop,as well as mag drop) whichif properly used have saved many lives when 'Mr. Bad' snatched the gunfrom the officer and tried to shoot said officer the gun was on safe andwould not fire.  This point had been made in many articles in various gun magazines.  If fact, one author (can't remember who) staged a littletest where he had a revolver and a S&W on safe laying on a table and askedpeople with little firearms experience to on his signal, grab the gun andshoot a target.  He timed the people using each gun.  The revolver timeswere pretty close, but some of the times with the S&W were in minutes, orthe person just gave up because they could not figure out the saftey.You don't often see Colt 45 autos issued due to the light triggerwhich can be accidentally fired in a stress situation, opening the issuingcity,county, etc.. to lawsuits, bad press, etc..Of course any problem can be overcome with enough training, butsuch training is not always available to budget crunched departments.  Iknow if I were a Cop I would want something like a S&W just for the offchance of the gun getting taken away.  The safety doesn't guarantee that'Mr. Bad' won't figure it out and shoot me, but it could buy enough timeto draw a second gun and shoot 'Mr. Bad' before it's too late.Don't think I am too biassed here just because I have had 3 Glocksin my possession at one time, because I have had a .45 as well.  In fact,it was my first handgun.  Remember, the ultimate 'safety' is YOU theoperator, and no safety is going to stop an negligent discharge (note Idon't say accidental) if you break the rules of gun handling.As per the part of being light weight and looking cool, I agree100%.  I wouldn't rule it out as a first purchase.  -Just my $.02 + tax-------   Steve Syck        syck5280@miller.cs.uwm.edu        --------

 89This was posted to the firearms-politics mailing list.==============================================================Hi Folks;Wednesday marked day 2, the beginning of the trial.  Openingstatements were given by both the prosecution and the defense,each side presenting its version of what happenned last August.The prosecution argued that Weaver and his family moved toIdaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the "evil" federalgovernment.  The prosecution alleges that Weaver sold federalagents "sawed off" shotguns and later failed to appear fortrial: Despite repeated "good faith" efforts to get Weaverto surrender peacefully, Weaver refused.  The shootout eruptedwhen Weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission andbegan firing.  According to the prosecution, three peoplewere taking an "offensive action" against an FBI helicopterwhen an FBI sniper killed Vicki Weaver.The defense argued that Weaver and his family moved to northernIdaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace.  They wantedsimply to be left alone.  Weaver was induced by federal agents tosell the short-barrelled shotgun (and did not, as the prosecutionalleged, want to become a "regular supplier").  The defense alsoargued that the federal government sought to arrest Weaver whenhe wouldn't become an informant [it is not specified explicitly,but I assume that this is a reference to the white separatistangle of the story.  We'll know more as things develop].  Thefailure to appear in court happenned because Weaver was givenan incorrect court date and then indicted before that date.The shootout occurred when federal agent Arthur Roderick killedWeaver's dog that was in proximity to Weaver's son, Samuel.  Weaverthen fired in self-defense.  In the ensuing battle, federalagent William Degan was killed (when his gun was later found,there were 7 .223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic:However, agents were near the body for an extended period oftime and could have played with the select-fire - this willhave to be more fully explained).  Finally, the defense claimsthat Vicki Weaver was only going to "look at the body" [not recover?]of her son when she was cut-down by an FBI sniper.Prosecution quote: "Weaver wanted that confrontation, and he madethat confrontation." -- Asst. U.S. Attorney Kim LindquistDefense quote: "The evidence in this case is going to show thatthis is a case where Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris are chargedwith crimes they didn't commit in order to cover crimes thatthe government did commit."  -- Gerry Spence  [nice soundbite!]Notes: The _Idaho Statesman_ claims that Weaver supportersheeded a call from Spence not to repeat yesterday's protestsoutside the courthouse.  However, the local NBC affiliateagain had footage on the 10:00 news with 5 supporters including"Tim" again.  "Tim" claimed he was a skinhead, who were "ordinary,working class people."  He also claimed he was for "white pride,not white power."Outside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interviewwith Bo Gritz, who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactlywhat the government wants to smear Randy Weaver.In an affiliated article carried in the _Idaho Statesman_, abouta dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into thecourthouse.  These lawyers were present to watch Gerry Spencein action, and to perhaps learn something from him.  Sometidbits: Spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son Kentwere volunteering their time to represent Weaver because theybelieved in him.  Spence, during his 90-minute opening statement,repeatedly walked behind Weaver and placed his hands on thedefendants shoulders (Weaver broke down and cried during therecounting of his wife's death), and Spence compared the "sawedoff" shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 (anothergood one!).Today (Thursday, April 15th) the prosecution was scheduled tobegin presenting evidence.Drew=============================================================-- *************************************************************** Ron Phillips               crphilli@hound.dazixca.ingr.com ** Senior Customer Engineer                                   ** Intergraph Electronics                                     ** 381 East Evelyn Avenue               VOICE: (415) 691-6473 ** Mountain View, CA 94041              FAX:   (415) 691-0350 ***************************************************************

 26|QUESTION:|What will Californians do with all those guns after the Reginald|denny trial?The Wall Street Journal had an article on how the police were whiningabout all the new guns; excuse me, but police are EMPLOYEES of thegovernment. Rather like having your janitor complain about jobconditions.I say Californians should form armed block clubs that would engagein coordinated strategies should BATF attempt to disarm them basedon the "nefarious tipster" theory of law enforcement. Unlike Waco, Californians should be able to destroy armored vehicles in citystreets with incendiary weapons, acetylene after slowing them downwith abandoned car blockades. M-1 Garands should easily outclassBATF shock troops with their H&K MP-5 SMGs, and there should beenough Sony Walkmans and Boom Boxes to overwhelm any FBI psy-waroperation... yes, a good time would be had by all. Billary Clintonwould get what he wanted, a War on Gunowners, the BATF would attemptto show the anti-gun press they they really, REALLY were in chargewith a 500-man "Charge of the Light Brigade," and the FBI would attempt to show how _THEY_ really were in charge by asking the Californian National Guard to level the area with artillary!:-) :-) :-)
 19The best reason to abolishing the ATF is that they don't have enoughto do.  If the organization were disbanded and its duties assigned tothe FBI (firearms) and IRS (tobacco and alcohol).  Both of theseorganizations have enough to do.  The FBI is probably not going to tryto get a criminal charge of illegal machine gun for having a brokengun. There have been postings stating that law enforcement should bedivided and and weak.  But there is nothing more dangerous toliberties than a law enforcement agency without enough criminals tochase.  The ATF is one and look at the trouble it started inWaco. --Rod Anderson  N0NZO         | "I do not think the United States governmentBoulder, CO                 | is responsible for the fact that a bunch ofrcanders@nyx.cs.du.edu      | fanatics decided to kill themselves"satellite  N0NZO on ao-16   |        Slick Willie the Compassionate

She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was|on her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't think|civilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.Well, if police think they are so special that only _THEY_ are worthyof self-defense, perhaps we start putting the arm on police; maybewe should start demanding that police are only police when ON-DUTY,that after that they are just like the ordinary disarmed helplesschumps they consider "civilians."Let's prohibit arms carrying by police when off-duty. Or, if they makethe assertion that "Well, I need to maintain my gun" let's make itregulation that they can carry an UNLOADED firearm home, that it'sonly fair that they be just as helpless as poor schmuck coming homefrom his computer operator job...NRA Director/ex-San Jose cop Leroy Pyle states in the latest SWATmagazine that anti-cops better watch out for this schism betweenRKBA folks and the police. He asks the rhetorical question of 'Whatif what's left of the gun lobby starts demanding the disarmamentof the police?"Well, I guess anti-gun cops who think only they should be armed,along with the wealthy and politically connected, should be madeto realize that screwing can cut in ways they have yet to imagine.

[emphasis added by me]Investigators will re-create conditions at thecompound and identify accelerants and other fac-tors fueling the inferno.  That is their strong suit.But the public must question why agents of theFederal Bureau of Investigation lacked the oper-ational skill and teh behavioral insight to resolvethe 51-day standoff free of flames and fury.The loss of life most clearly reflects the demen-tia of cult leader David Koresh, whose personaldelusiosn are now seared on the public conscious-ness.  His assembly of Davidians had stockpiles ofarms--and had used them.  LIttle in the way ofrationality could be expected from Koresh, a self-confsesed "sinner without equal."What continues to mystify are th eactions offederal agents, who bungled the case from thestart.  The misadventure began on Feb. 28 when100 agents of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, To-bacco and Firearms storemd the compound, intenton seizing Koresh and a cache of automatic weap-ons.  Four agents and an estimated  six cult mem-bers died inteh ensuing gun battle.  Earlieroppor-tunities to isolate and arrest Koresh outside thecomplex had not been adequately explored.Authorities prepared a siege and resolved thatthose deaths would be the last.  Fifty-one days into the siege there was no public outcry to storm thecompound.It had been correctly perceived that the chil-dren inside "Rancho Apocalypse" were essentially hostages.  With their lives at stake, there was noreason for the government to be impatient.  Thegovernment's superior firepower, control of waterand utilities and freedom of movement created theconditions for a belated but bloodless resolution.Neither Attorney General Janet Reno nor theFBI has provided a sigle compelling reason forabandondoning the course of patience.If intelligence was accurate and Koresh wasgrowing increasingly violent and bizarre, it is diffi-cult to see how a tear-gas attack launched by anM-60 combat vehicle would clear his mind.  If re-ports of escalating child abuse were accurate, theywould have to be weighted against the potential foreve ngreated hamr.etc etc tec....[paragraphs, 2.5 paragraphs deleted]But some of the responsibility rests with Clinton,and inexperienced president who did not payenough attention to the life-and -death decisionsbeing made on WAco.If Reno is to be faulted for anything, ti wouldbe for her overreliance on the judgment of law en-forcement officers--a common problem amongprosecutors.Full investigations into th eWaco tragedy mustbe conducted by both the executive and legislativebranches.  The first step is to verify how the blaze started.  Though apportioning blame will play a role, it is of greater importnace to find strategiesto elude the fire next time.[end of editorial]-J.

You'd have to be very unfamiliar with US history to   think that we have substantially fewer rights today than in   in 1932.  The police could generally get away with a lot more  in those days, there were few citizens and media "watchdog"   organizations, no "Miranda" rulings, and women, blacks, gays,  and other such groups had very few right indeed.  Moreover  censorship of media and similar artistic expression was rampant  at that time (think about "banned in Boston" or the Hays  Commission).

The Denver Post finds that the use of assaultweapons poses a threat to the health, safety, and security of its readers.\\end{quote}Now I suppose the Post is within its rights to refuse such ads.  However,the second sentence is so noxious, I feel compelled to bring it to the attention of the t.p.g/c.g readership.  I called the Post classified number (825-2525) and expressed my displeasure. According to the supervisor I spoke to, the Post was reacting to publiccomplaints regarding the running of assult weapon ads.  However, she saidthe paper was keeping track of the reaction to the change in policy.  I strongly encourage Denver Post readers to call and make their feelings known.Eric E.

The number bounces between 2% and 18%, depending on the study quoted andthe type of gun being studied.Some cites:---------------------------------------A recent BATF study (titled "Protecting America, Yes") surveyed 471 career criminals and found that only 7% of guns used in violent crimes werepurchased from retail dealers.---------------------------------------National Institute of JusticeResearch in BriefNovember 1986                        The Armed Criminal in America                              by James D. Wright(1) Legitimate firearms retailers play only a minor role as direct    sources of handguns for adult felony offenders.Only about one-sixth of the gun-owning felons obtained their mostrecent handguns through a customary retail transaction involving alicensed firearms dealer.  The remainder -- five out of six --obtained them via informal, off-the-record transactions involvingfriends and associates, family members, and various black marketoutlets.  The means of acquisition from these informal sourcesincluded cash purchase, swaps and trades, borrowing and renting, andoften theft.  The criminal handgun market is overwhelmingly dominatedby informal transactions and theft as mechanisms of supply.---------------------------------------INDEPENDENCE ISSUE PAPER No. 4- 91Independence Institute14142 Denver West Parkway #101Golden, CO 80401 (303) 279-6536              WHY GUN WAITING PERIODS THREATEN PUBLIC SAFETY                             By David B. Kopel     The basic problem with waiting periods is shown by a Bureau of Alcohol,Tobacco and Firearms study of gun dealer sales in Des Moines and Greenville.The study found that about one to two percent of sales were to dangerouscriminals.[51]  In short, waiting periods have no statistically noticeableimpact on any type of crime because only a tiny fraction of crime gunsare purchased at retail by ineligible buyers.51. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Assistant Director of CriminalEnforcement, Memorandum to Director, July 10, 1975 (Greenville survey; of20,047 names submitted to FBI for record checks, 68 had felony convictions;of those, 41 had not been represented by counsel at their conviction or whocommitted crimes in the distant past; twenty-seven buyers were prosecuted)(of the 1.3% of buyers selected for prosecution, .9% had non-violent felonyconvictions, and .4% had violent convictions). Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco andFirearms, Assistant Director for Criminal Enforcement, memorandum toDirector, May 8, 1975 (of 374 records checked, 39 were purchasers with felonyrecords who were not appropriate for prosecution because of age ornon-violent nature of felony; six purchasers were prosecuted).---------------------------------------INDEPENDENCE ISSUE PAPER No. 12-91                          THE ASSAULT WEAPON PANIC:                      POLITICAL CORRECTNESS" TAKES AIM                            AT THE CONSTITUTION                      By Eric Morgan and David Kopel     Testimony before Congress revealed that most "assault weapons" in thehands of criminals were obtained through illegal channels.{97}  The testimonyis consistent with the National Institute of Justice's research findingsbased on studies of felons in state prisons. The NU study, authored bysociologists James D. Wright and Peter Rossi found that only sixteen percentof criminals had obtained their most recent handgun from a gun store. (Thefigures included purchases by legal surrogates, rather than directly by thecriminal.) Wright and Rossi, who had begun their research as firm proponentsof gun control, concluded that no set of controls on retail purchases, andprobably not even full scale gun prohibition, would reduce criminal use ofguns. Wright and Rossi suggested that lawmakers concerned about gun crimedirectly target the black market in criminal guns, andleave the legitimate retail market alone.{98}   Not surprisingly, Wrightbelieves that the consequences of current "assault weapon" legislation onstreet violence are likely to be ineffective.{99}   He warns that guncontrols aimed at ordinary citizens are less likely to reduce the pool ofcriminal guns than to provide organized crime with lucrative newbusiness.{100}6.   _See, _e.g., The Anti-drug, Assault Weapons Limitation Act of 1989.

 36    Editorial - A10, Saturday, April 24, 1993    CRIMESTRIKE HITS TOWN    With the chilling reality of crime at the hands of urban terrorists    that were noted above (a high school student and gang article in the    same column), we welcome into the ranks of those dedicated to re-    moving criminals from the streets the National Rifle Association's    new CrimeStrike project, engineered by Arizona's former chief assist-    ant attorney general Steven J. Twist.    CrimeStrike is working to reverse the disturbing trend of daily    crime.  It is promoting solutions that can be applied nationally,    including tough and honest sentencing of the sort that Arizona is    applying with its Truth in Sentencing law; funding construction and    staffing of appropriate prison space; ensuring that the system is    primed to punish serious youthful offenders; strict attention to the    rights of victims; and citizen and community involvement.    Phoenix will be the home for this national organization.    The Gazette has vigorously opposed many NRA policies on issues of gun    control, and will be resolute in promoting prudent laws that seek    reasonable regulation of firearms.    But CrimeStrike is an appropriate creation, a response to a clear    need for more robust vigilance in holding legislators and judges ac-    countable when it comes to swiftly and surely punishing criminals.    When an organization has an issue, it has an issue, and Crime-    Strike has it - especially when it is willing to direct its dollars    to getting criminals off the street.    We say, welcome to town.

Their neighbours thought they were a littlestrange but all in all the kind of people you would want to livenext door to.One version has the BATF serving a *search* warrant by jumping outof a horse trailer with guns and tossing concussion grenades.  Ifthis is the true order of events then the 'cult' could not knowthat a search warrant was being served and since there was no proofthat these guys were police,  the 'cult' had every right to defendthemselves.: Torching themselves shows briliant tactics, and convinces me: they *realy* belong in society ...If you watch actual footage of the fire from start to finish itis not at all clear that fire wasn't started by the tanks.  Thepeople who survived are claiming that the fire was started bythe tanks knocking over some kerosene lanterns.  The FBI isclaiming that the 'cult' started the fire.'they *realy* belong in society' is a catchy phrase butI'm personally waiting to see what the Texas Rangers have to sayabout it all before I pass judgment.   Why don't you do the same.Some more interesting facts about the Waco incident:1)  The original assault was conducted by BATF officers wearing    an assorted types of camouflage.  I saw, on CNN, at least    three different types.   I would be hard pressed to identify    a bunch of guys in 'bring-your-own' battle fatigues as    uniformed officers of the law even if they were claiming to    be police.    2)  The BATF has been lying from the beginning:    + "We only had handguns" - the original footage showed 4 BATF      officers on a roof top getting shot at,  one had an MP-5      assault sub-machine gun.    + "We were out gunned" - sub-machine guns and shotguns are the      BEST in quarters weapon,  you can't be out gunned when you      have the best guns available for the job.    + "We didn't know they had guns that would shoot through doors!" -      this one is the best,  there are very few guns that won't shoot      through a household door,  or through a house WALL for that      matter.  Since officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and      *Firearms* should know that,  they are either lying or incredibly      incompetent.  Not to mention criminally negligent if they are      shooting bullets that they think will stop when the encounter      plywood.    + "We had a search warrant.  Actually, we had an arrest warrant.       No, wait,  we had both.  Yeah, that's the ticket.       Oh, and they're child molesters too.  And they make *drugs*.       Did we mention we think they have rocket launchers."      - The story from BATF and FBI spokespeople has changed daily      and their claims were getting increasingly outrageous.      3)  Throughout the siege the FBI and BATF have be claiming that one    of their biggest concerns was that Koresh and his followers would    mass suicide.   Now they are claiming that that's what he did    AND that they are surprised that he did.  Huh?All in all I think that anything the FBI and BATF say should betaken with a grain or two of salt.Rob.--Robert A. Osborne   ...!uunet.ca!isgtec!robert or robert@isgtec.com
 17Approved: gun-control@cs.umd.eduI have also heard about HCI claiming thant anyone they  get an addressfrom is a member.  If this is the case their membership rolls aregrossly inflated and we should not call them and give them a nameand address to add to their already false rolls.  Perhapsif you could get a copy of their existing membership, then pretend tobe an existing member, do that several thousand times, you couldhurt HCI.  But names are power.  Remeber the NRA uses the factthat it has 3 million paid members in order to flex its muscles.Perhaps politicians don't realize the lying tactics of HCI, wait aminute, HCI learned it from politicians....Later,Josh

That is the prime reason why the National Firearms Act is based on collecting revenue.Since the Congress has the authority to levy taxes, the NFA is a tax act andthe registration requirement within it is to assist in that tax collection.U.S.C 922, in order to be constitutional, must have a basis on a particularauthority granted to the Congress by the Constitution.  Congress can notarbitrarily ban a substance or product.  That is why prohibition came intoeffect, only by passing an ammendment.   What you said about constitutionalityof law needs to be clarified.  I believe that an unconstitutional law was never constitutional.  When a law is determined by the Supreme Court, to beunconstitutional, that law was never really a law.  The very nature of the lawbeing unconstitutional invalidates the law at it's inception.  Please correctme if I'm wrong, but when a law is deemed to be unconstitutional, anyoneconvicted of breaking that law is absolved.   I don't believe U.S.C 922 has ever been challenged in court.  NFA has beeninvalidated in two Federal District Court cases( one may have been appellatelevel{ U.S. vs Rock Island Armory  and U.S. vs Dalton}).

OR you shouldget a new goverment. (You do have elections??)Guns 'n Criminals:MOST weapons used by criminals today are stolen.Known criminals can NOT buy weapons, that's one of the points of gun control.And because gun control are strict in WHOLE scandinavia (and most of europe),we dont have any PROBLEM with smuggled guns.Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one:What I meant was that cars CAN kill, but they are not GUNS!Someone said that if we 'ban' guns we'd have to ban cars to, because they 'kill' to...I don't think we should argue on this one..... ;)The issue (I hope..):I think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem.Guns are not a problem, but the way they are used is.... (and what are they for??)I think this discusion is interesting when you think of (ex)Jugoslavia:They should all have weapons, it's their rigth to have them, and if they use themto kill other (Innocent) people the problem is humans, not guns.If 50% of ALL murders was done with axes, would you impose some regulations on themor just say that they are ment to be used at trees, and that the axe is not a problem,it's the 'axer' ??(An example, don't flame me just because not exactly 50% are killed by guns...)Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protectthemselves. Is this a good situation ?? Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem ??If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals (and their neighbor who haveguns) what do you think will happen ?? (I mean if everybody had a gun in USA)Don't flame the Englishmen because of Northern Irland, they have gun control that works(in England) and fonds from USA are one of the reasons why IRA can bomb innocents...(Something about throwing stones in glass houses...)Don't flame them because of what to (three?) children did either.(Can an Jugoslav have an oppinion on guns or even peace??)

 37Approved: gun-control@cs.umd.edu[MODERATOR:  Nice summary, Keith, thanks.]I talked to the federal Dept. of Justice (DOJ, Ottawa) to try andclarify a bunch of things regarding changes to Canadian gun laws.I am posting here for informational purposes; questions to email,followup to t.p.g.1. It is still technically feasible (but almost impossible) to get   a concealed carry permit in Canada.  This is contrary to what I   was told by a police officer.2. It is still legal to use lethal force (such as a firearm) to   protect life, also contrary to what the officer told me.  Guns   must be stored locked up and unloaded, however.3. Regarding hi-capacity magazines, it is still not clear who will   be exempt or how this will be managed.  This is up to each province.   The general idea is that exempt persons will receive a letter/form   authorizing them to possess the high capacity magazines.     Apparently, the authorization is to specify how many of these   'prohibited weapons' you will be allowed to possess.  Dealers will   be allowed to order high capacity mags for those allowed to possess   them, but will not be allowed to stock them.4. High capacity magazines converted to comply with the new limits will   not be considered prohibited weapons.  Amendments to the regulations   specify some possible methods to alter the magazines.  Some    manufacturers (Beretta) will be marketing reduced capacity magazines.   (God knows how much they'll charge for these)This covers most of what we discussed.

Each side is committed to overstating the problem it addresses.  For the procontrol forces, that problem is the contribution of guns to violence and crime, while for the anticontrol forces, that problem is the procontrol forces...  Each set of advocacy group serves as the demon by which the other side can rally the troops, raising morale and money.  The public is not enlightened by this war of words because neither set of advocates has any stake in merely presenting the plain, unvarnished truth, even to the extent that flawed and biased human minds can understand it.  Quite the contrary -- to tell the truth and nothing but the truth would place one side at a distinct disadvantage if the other side did not also lay down their propaganda weapons."

Unfortunately, the states relinquished their own, independent militia units to the National Guard -- which can be "federalized" into Army service by the President at any time -- in their hunger for federalfunds.  And it was the STATES -- not the gun owners -- who passed laws against "private citizens engaging in martial drill."So, many gun owners train to the remaining lawful limit, which trainingis almost exclusively administered by the NRA -- not the states, notthe feds.

 96/ iftccu:talk.politics.guns / mikey@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu (Strider) /  8:51 pm  Apr 12, 1993 />I think most of us would rather be held up with a knife than with a gun,>but HOW THE HELL ARE YOU GOING TO MANAGE THAT?  You still haven't offeredI've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (evencontributed a few comments) but this stuff "I'd rather face a knife thana gun" has GOT to come from ignorance!  I used to think pretty much thesame thing, then I got 'educated.'People do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or howquickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don't understand thatit takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick(within a minute or so) death.The death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentagepoints of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadlyonly in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is aremote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls aspherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.Most people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger byaccident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match fora holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has onlymoderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for aDRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs outof ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill andability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast andstrong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacksused by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolledslashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trainedmartial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go upagainst a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad asthe attacker.Practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicingwith knives requires only a small area and something to simulate aknife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice theirknife attacks in prison.If you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realizethese facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong isthe knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experiencedattacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year oldman with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in aboutone and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walkingcast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strikein 1 second.  I'm old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3seconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weaponsthat you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chestwith a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not thepointed end.)Add to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth.Except in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round thatdestroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelveseconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.'This is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police womanin L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  Thatlady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  Allfour of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Attagirl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apexof her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver anddestroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ballsized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but wasout of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eightmonths!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She wason her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't thinkcivilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.The moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knifeattacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A goodalternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk(a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchorthem.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contactweapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' andis more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming acaliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usuallydo this.Remember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to liveand them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keepus alive.I don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I nowknow, I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an gun.  It wouldhave to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, IWOULDN'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do notfear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizenbehind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to dowhatever it takes.Rick.

 43|What seems to be happening here is the situation getting totally blown out of|proportion.  In my post I was referring to your regular patrolman in a car|cruising around the city vs. gang members.  Of course the police have access|to the things that you mentioned but do they use tanks and such all of the|time?  Of course they don't and that's the point I was trying to make.  Every|day when I go out to lunch I always see cops coming in.  The majority that I|see are still carrying revolvers.  Not that there is anything wrong with a|revolver but if you're a cop that is up against some gang member with a couple|of automatics in his coat (I mean semi-auto handguns) you're going to be at a|disadvantage even with training.  I have been at a shooting range where gang|gang members were "practicing" shooting.  They were actually practicing|taking out their guns as quick as possible and shooting at the target|and they weren't doing too badly either.   The University cops here (who are|are state cops) are armed better than the Chicago police.  It seems most|state cops are.  I don't know where you are originally from David but you live|in Tennesse and I live in Chicago and see this crap everyday on the news|and in the papers.  I think the situation is just a tad different here|than there.However, don't forget that the police in Chicago can carry just aboutanything they want except for the Glock, which is not approved forcarry (Guess they figure all cops are like the Police Chief of Winnetka,who happened to let off a stray round of 9mm. This is the same anti-gunpolice chief that wanted full-auto Uzis for his patrol cars...).Perhaps in the judgement of the majority of Chicago's finest, a close-to-100% reliable weapon like a revolver is preferable to a 99.99% reliableautomatic. I note that in Germany, where certainly the 9mm semi-autohandgun is king, some of the more elite police types want revolvers.I don't think the issue is cost, because Chicago police certainly makeon the order of at least $40K/year. Your presumption of "disadvantage" I think is not borne out by theexperiences of New York City's cops; there the cops usually come outon top with their standard .38 Spl revolvers.I've seen S&Ws, Rugers and Beretta 9mms in addition to the revolverscarried by Chicago cops.... in the past, I've seen .45 M1911s; othershave seen Browning Hi-Powers...|Jason

I don't understand how the ratio to other accidentaldeaths is important.  So guns don't kill as many children as car accidents.What is the difference in severity between 1,000 deaths and 10,000 deaths?I am not trying to use accidental gun-related deaths among children as ajustification for gun control.  Who needs to be convinced that accidentalgun deaths of children is a serious problem?

Overall, I thought that Ihad made it clear that I did not think that gun buyback programs wereuseful.  >>I do know that the vast majority of guns that are used by youths or>>brought to school by youths on a daily basis (about 135,000 youths) are>>obtained easily and quickly, through a personal friend, or more often>>"borrowed" from a parent without their knowledge.>>I suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these "statistics" - I>suspect you'll find if you look carefully that 135,000 is the number of>students *estimated* to have carried *a weapon* (not necessarily a gun)>to school at least once in the past year, and not the number of students>who carry a gun to school daily.> Well Joe, I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violenceor the Centers for Disease Control.  If YOU look carefully you will seethat YOU greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths.The CPHV reports that 135,000 youth bring GUNS to school DAILY and that400,000 bring GUNS to school at least once a year.  The CDC estimatesthat 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least oncein 1990.  The CDC also says that 1.2 million elementary-aged, latch-keychildren (kids who come home from school to an empty house), have accessto guns in their home.  California schools reported a 200% increase instudent gun confiscations between 1986 and 1990, and a 40% increase between1988 and 1990.  Florida reported a 61% percent increase in gun incidents inschools between 1986/87 amd 1987/88.  These are the "statistics".   >>thus willing to follow a man who claimed to be the Messiah (Got news>>for you folks, if the Big Cheese was on this crazy planet of ours>>presently, he would NOT be carrying a gun or holding children when they>>were in danger).>>"Holding kids?"

Although this case did not pertain to firearms, Justice Rhenquist    notes that the term "the people" is a term of art conveying individual    rights, and specifically cited several used, 2nd ammentment included,    in his opinion.  - Title 10, U.S. Code.  This states that all males between the ages of    18 & 45 not part of the organized militia, and all female officers of    the national guard are part of the unorganized militia.Feel free to cite any scholarly and historical references you have tosupport your position.  I could go on a greater length with my personalproof by assertion, however, such a technique would carry no more orless weight that your dubious proofs by assertion.

 35>Hell, a Glock is the last thing that should be switched to.  The only thing>that I know about a Glock is the lack of a real safety on it.  Sure there is>that little thing in the trigger but that isn't too great of a safety.You're getting warmer.  The 'little thing in the trigger' has to bedepressed before the trigger can move.  What this means is the damnedthing won't go off until the trigger is pulled.  This makes it justabout (there HAVE been some problems, but we're assuming the gun isfunctioning correctly..) as safe as a revolver.  The gun when workingcorrectly is totally drop safe.Now, in police work this is a consideration.  There is not a singledocumented case I'm aware of where a police officer was killed becausehe failed to operate the safety on his firearm.  There are quite a fewdocumented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn'tfigure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun, thus theproprietary nature of the safety (to the criminal at least) very likelyprevented the office from getting shot.The purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire.This does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow downintentional use!  Thus the Glock safety is perfectly adequate from a'safety' standpoint, but not necessarily the most desirable from thestandpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else.By this criteria it DOES make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece.From the standpoint of police use, it is no better (or worse) than arevolver as far as being 'proprietary' to the officer in the method offiring it.The ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so thatthe firearm can't be used by anybody but it's owner, but for now thewide variety of safety systems helps, unless the criminal happens to befamiliar with that particular type of firearm.Rick.

If amnesty was their concern, they should pay in cash rather than moneyorderand they should check to see if the gun turned in was stolen or not.This way if a gun turns out to be stolen, then even if they wanted to prosecute, they don't know who to prosecute.Since the only concern of these(HCI and the like) people seems to be the totaleradication of guns( legal or illegal ), why should they bother to check forstolen property.  If they knew who the rightful owner is, then they would haveto return the gun and hence contrary to their intent to ban all guns.

No piece of paper can preventabuse, for example the imprisonment of the socialist presidential candidatefor opposing world war I - a clear breach of the first ammendment,The United States clearly has the capacity to bring in meaningful armscontrol measures. If there were large groups of powerful warlords who couldprevent such a measure by force we would have to admit that the powerof the federal government to uphold the constitution was limited. Thisis the situation in Somalia where the state is unable to govern becausethe people with the guns think that they have the right to decide thelaw.|>>You have a very confused notion of what a state is.

But it was|>certainly enforced in non-state courts for some time, although state|>courts, being subsidized, later were able to effectively enter the|>arbitration business.But here we are not talking of a time where law was voluntary. The rulesand regulations settled in this manner were in areas that the state was not involved in. Even today a great deal of law is effectivelymade in this manner. For example the city of London stockmarket which isa non governmental body that can make and enforce rules. It does so howeverwithin the framework laid down by the government.In medieval times this framework existed in preciosely the same manner. Ifyou were to set up shop as a trade association and decide to screw themonarch you could expect to end up inside the tower in a very shorttime. Most of the organisations allowed to make law have explicit RoyalCharters, such as the Universities for example. Fairs and towns all required authority in order to trade. It was customary however for this authorityto be granted on a permanent basis subject to revocation in the case ofmisbehavior. After Magna Carta the monarch lost the power to removeprivillage without recourse to the courts. Tony Benn recently establishedthrough a devious route the power of the Parliament to revoke favourswithout recourse to the courts - thus establishing the right to abolishthe house of lords for example.Certainly none of the rules set up by merchants forms any part of the "common law" which has a very specific meaning in the UK. It is lawmade by the judiciary through judgements on cases. Nothing else iscommon law.Incidentaly the common law is a lot more common than people expect. Forexample a judgment in common law made in England can effect the interpretation of the law in most of the countries that were once inthe Empire, including the US, the reverse is also true. For example alot of the decisions surrounding AIDS cases in the US are of relevanceto UK decisions. Although the statues are different the reasoning thatlies behind the interpretation of those statues is common and thus ifa judge made a reasoned assesment of the interpretation of the law inone jurdisdiction it would clearly be perverse if another country with noguiding precedent should judge a person to be guilty of a crime whichthey might by the existence of a precedent consider to be legal. The lawshould be as predictable as possible and abhors making decisions withoutprecedent. Once a decision is made in the UK though that naturally is superior in UK law.Phill Hallam-Baker.

Look, I don't want to bore everybody here with the physics of woodstoves,but they're not anything like your Caloric gas range.  It takes aboutthree hours for a woodstove to get hot enough to cook on, and afterwards you can't just "shut it off" -- it will contain hot embers for over 24 hours even after you choke it COMPLETELY.So it ain't exactly "light up the stove and cook me a batch of them pancakes, Aunt J..."  If you use a woodstove for cooking, or even forheating your house at night, you will have it lit to SOME extent all the time.

Note that both are legal, and a lot of "common" people qualify>for one or the other.>>-andy>--Maybe Freeman did prove his point but his point is not relevant.  The thingthat most people seem to care about when they ask questions about carryinga concealed weapon is whether or not they can carry it concealed on theirperson when they are out on the street somewhere.  I'm sure that not manypeople are concerned with whether or not they can carry concealed at home.Speaking as someone who lives in Illinois (the only place where the abovequoted law is relevant :-)) I know that it is legal to own a handgun here (Iam not taking into account city ordinances).  I could care less about whetheror not I can carry concealed at home.         I only care about the fact thatI can't carry concealed in the place where it really counts- out on the street.Freeman loves to be accurate and I can understand that (especially not) but heseems to be forgetting that accurate facts don't always replace common sense.I am not going to followup to this thread anymore because I believe that it isuseless to argue these points anymore.  The only thing that is happening nowis that Freeman and I are "running around in circles" trying to prove eachother wrong and I do not have the time to be playing games anymore.  Of coursenow Freeman will attack me about my use of common sense in some of my earlierposts but what can I do.

There's one gun design where that can happen, and it issupposed to be carried with the hammer over an unloaded chamber.(Cocking the gun turns the cylinder so that a loaded cylinder is underthe hammer.  In other words, it can be usefully carried in a safemanner.)

From them Ican safely say that if Davis is right in ALL of his claims, a largenegative number of people are killed by animals, because we know thatthe number of killings by wackos is reasonably large and that thenumber of accidents due to gun failures (which is a superset of thedescribed circumstance) is near zero.>I can find the figures if you don't believe me.Please do.

Then why did the smoke and flames start from three different places?: In particular, three different places where there were no APV's?The crushed remains of a PRESSURIZED propane tank were found in the ruinsof the BD compound.  The key word is PRESSURIZED.  When that baby was crushed, the gas would have gone all over the place.  And when ignited, would look just like the pictures of the explosion we saw on the TV news.  Ammo doesn't go up all at once - kind of like fireworks going off.Propane gas goes off in a big fireball.  Gee, that's kind of consistent with what the pictorial history shows.  Hmmmmm...: And if the government did start the fire, then why weren't people trying: to get out of the compound?Remember, PRESSURIZED gas.  People all over the building.Conflagration in less than a minute.  Huge explosion.  Gas masks beingworn by the inhabitants.  Makes a lot of sense that very few of thoseon the inside would even know that the tank was damaged.  If theythought it was just a normal fire, they would probably be trying toput it out.  Then - BOOM - the fireball.  After that explosion and concussion, I doubt anybody on the inside of the building was capableof moving.: And besides... oh, I don't know why I'm even bothering.Good question.  Take an objective look at what happened, listen to the things that the FBI said ("The BD's started the fire."  "The BD's bodieswere found with gunshot wounds.") that are now being refuted by the evidence being recovered.  Seems that the FBI is deliberately makingstatements that have no rational basis in fact, and trying to makethem sound like fact.  : I find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem eager to believe: a murderous, heavily-armed religious cult, despite much evidence to the: contrary. Thought Experiment: Suppose this exact same thing happened under: the Bush administration. What would your answer be then? Would you still: prefer to believe the cultists?Yes, I would still believe that the FBI and the BATF were on a non-stopstring of lies and half-truths.  This is consistent with their operationson numerous occasions.And as for the BD's being murderous, they did not cause any problems untilthey were assaulted by the BATF.  So now a thought experiment for you:  Ifthe BATF had never stormed that farm, would four agents and 90 BD's bedead today?  : (No, I don't really expect a response to that challenge.): >But then: >again, that is how Mr. Clinton was elected, by people who believe that: >his campaign promisses would be respected by him once he got into office.: Um, isn't that how all politicians are elected?Yes.  That is how politicians are elected.  Kind of scary, isn't it.  Nowif we as a people actually held Mr. Clinton to his promises instead ofapologizing and denying that he ever made them, and actually expectedaccountability by our government, I doubt that debacles like Waco wouldhappen as often as they do.: So is there any particular reason the gummint decided to slaughter eighty: people? Are they, like, just plain evil, or what? Did they just wake up: one day, stretch and yawn, and throw a dart at a map of the United States: to figure out who to oppress that day? I'm eager to know.Acutally, no.  THe BATF has a rather checkered history of staging raids ofthis sort just prior to the time when their budget comes up for review.  Oddly enough, their budget was about to be reviewed just two weeks afterthe initial raid on the BD's.  "Coincidence?  I think not!"And as for the fire, what happened was caused by the act of knocking overwalls with an armored vehicle of destruction.  The FBI tried to convincethe world it was suicide, but all of the facts that are coming out bythe investigation of the Texas rangers and medical examiners point to a gas explosion and quick fire that decimated all of the occupants of thebuilding.  Sounds to me like a law enforcement agency that is trying to cover its ass.  : And does Bill Clinton have cooler theme music than Darth Vader? How is he: on diabolical laughter? Does he look good in a cape? These things MUST be: investigated. You first.Oh, please.  If you want to argue, argue.

Me,my wife, a friend, his wife, and his 2 kids were hiking in a totallydesolate mountain area.  All of a sudden, large rocks began raining downon us.  Looking up, we saw at least 3 punks gleefully letting loose rocksfrom what was an obvious stash.  They were a couple hundred feet above us.Meanwhile, the women and kids were screaming and running for cover and thepunks were shrieking with laughter.  Me and my friend yelled for them toknock it off.  They responded that we should "Get f***ed!".  Me and myfriend drew our pistols and fired a couple of times into the trees abovetheir heads.  They ran.  With no more 3-5 pound rocks coming at our heads,we proceeded on our journey.Sorry, but me and my friend saw no need to let it evolve to a more"violent" level than we were already experiencing.  I guess we shouldhave tried harder to understand and cope with the anger that societyhad instilled in them and was driving them to do such things.  Guessthat's a cross I'll have to bear.Brad

I'msorry if I jumped to conclusions about your reason for mentioningaccidental deaths due to firearms being something that warranted concern,but in light of your statement that you are a staunch supporter of guncontrol measures, I think the conclusion was a reasonable one.The fact remains that tragic though individual accidental gun deaths maybe, they are *not* a serious problem statistically speaking.>>Please explain why you think "symbolic offerings" do good.>>> My point was, gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police>departments MIGHT (I stress might) do a LITTLE (I stress little) good by>giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond>to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way.

According-> > to the Federalist Paper's, a well regulated militia has a well defined -> > structure and follows nationally uniform regulations.-> -> Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!!Perhaps you should, reread Federal 29 which deals exclusively with the"well regulated malitia."  Here is what is says about its character: To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the character of a well-regulated militia, It also talks about the "well regulated militia" having a nationallyuniform in structure and disipline.  I will note you did quote the end of this particular paragraph which states:    Little more can reasonably be aimed at, withrespect to the people at large, than to have them properly armedand equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, itwill be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course ofa year.But, do you knew how much organization is required to training a largegroup of poeple twice a year.  Just to try to get the same peopleevery year, provide a basic training to new people so they canbe integrated into the force, and find a suitable location, it requires a continually standing committee of organizers.  Since a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure anddisipline, and meet once or twice a year to train, how can you claima "well regulated militia" is not well organized.  But I will concide a "well organized militia" is not necessarily a "well regulated militia." Several people have stated that the "well organized militia" iswhat is defined under 10 USC 311, which statesThe militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizents of the United States who are commissioned officers of the National Guard.This deos define the militia, but were is the adjective "well regulated."10 USC 311 does not define a "well regualed militia" in any way, shape, or form.  It only defines who can become part of a well regulated militiaThe Federalist Papers CLEARLY define the "well regualed militia" as aproper SUBSET of the militia.  In the same paragraph quoted above, ittalk above "disciplining all the militia of the United States" so theyfit the "character of a well-regulated militia."  This is what theparagraph states about the associated costs:It would form an annual deduction from the productive labor of the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the present numbers of the people, would not fall far short of the whole expense of the civil  establishments of all the States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent,would be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not succeed, because it would not long be endured.Another quote provide by Charles Scripter is:James Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the "General Welfare" clause): "Nothing is more natural nor common than firstto use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by arecital of particulars."So the phrase "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed" must either qualify or explain the phrase "a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state."  The definition of "explain" as stated in "The American HertitageDictionary of the Enlish Language" The New College Edition, 1982 is:1) To make plain or comprehensible; remove obscruity from;   elucidate: "It was the economists who undertook to explain    this puzzle"2) To define; explicate; expound: He explained his plan.3) To offer reasons for or a cause of; an answer for' justify:   explain an errorThe second phrase clearly does not "explain" the first, thereforethe second phrase must "qualify" the first.  The definition givenfor "qualify" is:1) To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities   of; characterize.2) To make competent or suitable for office, position, or    task.3) To give legal power to; make legally capable.4) To modify, limit, or restrict, as giving exceptions.5) To make less harsh or severe; moderate6) Grammar: To modify the meaning of (a word or phrase)Since "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not beinfringed" does not describe, modify or make less harsh anything andit has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task.By process of elimination it must fall into definition #3.  And since#3 deals with legal power, the same thing the Constitution does, itmust be the correct definition in this case.  Therefore, "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms" gives legal power to the "well regualated militia" and this legal power "shall not be infringed".  I thank you very much Mr Scripter, you have provided me with more evidence that the Second Amendment only concerns itseft with the people's right to form well regulate militia, and says very little about the right of an untrained person to "keep and bear" a .50 calibermachine gun.  And since I, totally untrained in the use of any firearm(something I personly have meant to correct by going to a NRA gunsafety course and joining a gun club), cannot legally buy such a machinegun, I conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree withme.-> So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy-> our Liberties and Rights.I mean "to destory our Liberties and Rights."  Is that why a participatein the discussion of exactly what "our Libertues and Rights" are?  I force my version of "our Liberties and Rights" by begining statementsof what "our Liberties and Rights" with "All that the Second Amendment clearly states to me."   Using expressions, such as "states to me," clearly mean I intend to force my views on others?  I don't think so.So in effort not to force my views and not "to destory our Liberties andRights,"  I state that nothing I have written, or will write, inthe matter of "Liberties and Rights" is the final word.  For I am onlyone person among many and the final word on "Liberties and Rights" clearyand irrevocably belongs to the many. +-----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+|                             |  "If only it were a modern document, with a   || John Lawrence Rutledge      | smart index and hyper links stretching all    || Research Assistant          | through the world data net.

"A handful of anti-gun zealots are telling the public that theirright to self-defense is of less importance than the interests ofHandgun Control, Inc.  This action comes as local, state and federal lawenforcement officials continue their assault on the Branch Davidiancompound--an assault which has already resulted in the death of onetwo year old child at the hands of federal agents.  This has highlightedthe need for citizens to be able to defend themselves and their childrenagainst the excesses of their own government.">   "Any suggestion by proponents that this bill will help to reduce>crime is a distortion of the facts, at best.

"Any suggestion by opponents that this bill will increase crime is a distortion of the facts, at best.  The aggressive outreach by officialsin central Florida to train and arm women has led to a dramatic drop inthe level of assault and rape in that area.  Of course, this program isa rare gem, as many law enforcement officials apparently believe that anunarmed citizenry will be easier to control, and thus favor tighter restrictions.">   "The vote today is an insult to the law enforcement officials who>are putting their lives on the line every day to end the standoff in>Waco.

They know the  dangers.  Remember, the BATF invited the initial coverage. And how about a  simple, remote-controlled, camera or two?  There were ways to provide media  access.  The FBI obviously just didn't want any.> > The root cause of suspicion in my mind is why 100 people wouldn't flee > a building that had numerous exits during the 30 minutes time it took > to burn down.

 26In the interests of completeness, I thought readers of these newsgroups would want to see FBI Director William Sessions'statement, as released by the FBI press office. FBI Director's Statement On Waco Standoff To: National Desk Contact: Federal Bureau of Investigation, Press Office,          202-324-3691   WASHINGTON, April 19 -- The following is a statement by FBI Director William S. Sessions regarding the Branch Davidian incident in Waco, Texas:   "I had hoped to be making a very different statement this evening.After very careful planning and extensive preparation we all thoughtthat today's efforts by the FBI to bring the Branch Davidians out oftheir compound would result in the peaceful resolution of thestand-off or at least meaningful negotiation.   "Instead, we are faced with devastation and death.  However, Ihave no question that our plan was correct and was conducted withextreme professionalism and care.  I applaud the restraint shown byagents in the face of life-threatening gunfire, and I thank them forrisking their lives to try to end this peacefully.  I have only thegreatest admiration for the courage and professionalism of allinvolved." -30-

 72From article <1r0mhtINNa59@cronkite.Central.Sun.COM>, by dbernard@clesun.Central.Sun.COM (Dave Bernard):>>Does that include the right to murder little children?  How about killing>>ATF officers?  I do not know much about the gun laws in Texas, but >>Koresh's folks claimed to have grenades, grenade launchers, and rocket>>launchers.  I am not sure that the NRA feels that this falls under >>"right to bear arms.">  > If the waco wackos truly had grenade launchers and rocket launchers, why> weren't they used against the armored vehicles that attacked their house?> All the media stated was that small arms (ie, ineffective) fire was used> against them.I noticed that too.  Special agent (asshole actually) Ricks stated thatDavid Koresh had "explosives that could blow up an armored vehicle 40feet into the air."  It looked like to me that the BDs had plenty ofopportunity to use these explosives---provided that they had them in thefirst place.  For example, when one of the tanks was injecting CS gasinto the ranch house (yes ranch house; the BDs weren't living in afortress) they could have easily destroyed or disabled that tank becauseit was idling there for a considerable length of time.  So, why didn'tthey do this?  Could it be that they didn't have any explosives orsimilar munitions?  I just don't buy what the ATF and FBI have beensaying.  Hopefully, the truth will come out.Here's something noteworthy:  after the fire had been burning for sometime an explosion occurred---just *one* explosion.  The media said thatthis was some of the explosives that the BDs posessed going off.  Idon't think this was the case.  My brother and I noticed that thisso-called "explosion" resembled a plume of propane gas being ignited.We figure that this is what it was because of how the "explosion"looked and sounded.  Obviously, it wasn't due to something like TNT,dynamite, or C4.  I have seen a propane explosion before...the explosionin the ranch house greatly resembled this.  Also, I noticed somethingthat looked like a propane tank in the charred ruble the next day.Isn't it curious that the ATF wasn't very forthcoming about how the fourofficers got killed?  Many weeks had gone by before they stated thatsome of the officers had been killed and/or wounded by grenades thrownby the BDs.  Earlier, when someone asked one of the spokespersons aboutwhether or not an autopsy had been performed on the slain agents, theysaid that an autopsy had been done but THEY WEREN'T READY TO RELEASETHE FINDINGS.  Now why is this?  Does the ATF have something to hide?Perhaps those four agents were killed by friendly fire.  What is thecause of death exactly?  NO ONE HAS EVER SAID WHAT IT IS.What is certain is this:  ATF agents *did* throw grenades into thecompound.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Koresh handed his lawyer a grenadebody during one of the lawyer's visits to the compound.  Later onthe lawyer gave the grenade body (I don't know if it was a dud or aspent one btw) to the ATF.  How much do you want to bet that thisgrenade will mysteriously disappear?  At this point in time the onlypeople we know who had grenades was the ATF agents.  Wouldn't it bea shocker if the no one ever found any evidence of grenades, rockets,or explosives in the rubble?  The ATF would sure have egg on theirface then.  Note that the ATF is doing the *initial* sweep of therubble.  The FBI and the Texas Rangers won't investigate until theATF is done.  This looks like a perfect opportunity for the ATF tomake sure that others "find" what they want for them to "find" ifyou know what I mean.  I'm probably being a little paranoid herebut if I am I have could reason to be.  Recall that several weekshad gone by before anyone said that the BDs had used grenades.Also recall that early on the ATF had *denied* that their agentsused grenades on the BDs.  Someone is lying here.Scott Kennedy,  Brewer and PatriotBefore:  "David Koresh is a cheap thug who interprets          the Bible through the barrel of a gun..."  --ATF spokesmanAfter:   "[The ATF] is a cheap thug who interprets          [the Constitution] through the barrel of a gun..."  --Me

Itis true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn't cost you much.  Onthe other hand, I've had all sorts of interesting things happen over theyears.  For example, I've had FACTORY ammunition that has had highprimers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from secondsto minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem.An auto?  Jack the slide and continue.I've had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder fromturning, see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happenwith a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds.Most revolvers are more 'fragile' then semi auto's.  There are all sortsof close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun, or ablow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Manyof the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi autotake a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likelyto malfunction, but as a rule when it does, you're out of the fight.The majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fallinto that category.Vincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposingview of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoob's "The SemiAuto Pistol for Police and Self Defense."In general, I'd agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and selfdefense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclinationthat is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semiauto effectively as a self defense arm.Most cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the departmentisn't going to train them, they aren't going to take the time on theirown.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount oftraining required for effective use of a semi auto is probably severaltimes that of a revolver.  Many cops don't bother.For myself, I'd hate to be limited to one or the other.  I'd rather pickwhat fits better with my personal inclination, what I'm wearing that dayand so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all!That said, I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking ofbuying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get aRuger or Smith revolver....  (Sorry Colt fans.  Colt revolvers are oktoo!)If this post had gone the other way, I'd be arguing for revolvers. :-)Rick.

Eight people ran out into the feildssurrounding the compound. All were captured and two admitted to setting the fire. I don't buy your napalm theory at all (although it would have made a great commercial for my .sig). Why the hell would they have a wood stoveburning on such a warm day?

Regulated means "controlled"! How about security?While it may mean that in 1993, the relevant meaning comes from 1789.Moreover, "controlled" doesn't tell you WHO's doing the controllling.Fletcher's Political Works, pub'd in 1749, defines a "well-regulatedmilitia", that being the relevant phrase, as being an armed people NOTunder the control of govt.  The wigged gents who argued about theconstituion used it in that way.Feel free to provide a 1790s-era reference showing a usage other than"individual right, not to be interfered with by govt".Note that the first clause has a meaning - it is a restriction ongovt military power.  See Scarry's University of Penn law reviewarticle for an extended discussion.  The existence of a well-regulatedmilitia is a necessary part of that restriction, but it is not sufficient.-andy--

Then you can come home to something like this:    "Well, it's been a rough month," begins Johnnie Lawmaster.  "I just get laid off, and my divorce became final.  But I just wasn't ready for what happened this particular Monday."    That particular Monday was was December 16, the first day of the Bill of Rights' third century, the day when federal agents and local law enforcement officer broke into the house in Tulsa that always flew the U.S. flag.  When Lawmaster drove into the driveway that bleak afternoon, one of his neighbors had some news.    "'Ohmigod, John, you are in big trouble!' my neighbor tells me. 'Sixty police, federal agents and the bomb squad busted in you house, kicked down the door, cut locks off your gun safe.'  I couldn't believe it.  Then I walked inside.  What a nightmare."    It was no nightmare; it was horribly real life.  Apparently acting on information the Lawmaster possessed an illegal firearm, some thirty agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) teamed up with state and Tulsa police authorities, search warrant in hand, to search for a "Colt, AR-15, .223 caliber machine gun, unknown serial number."  The warrant, issued by U.S. Magistrate John Leo Wagner, also authorized agents to seize "any tools used in the alteration or modification of firearms, such as files or drills; documents, papers, books, records, and other tangible properties which identify occupants or owners of the property to be searched...."    Reports vary, but according to neighbors, the joint task force operation aimed at the unemployed warehouseman from a nearby hospital involved some 60 agents and local law enforcement personnel against Lawmaster.  They cordoned off the street; took station with weapons drawn in the back yard; used a battering ram to break through the front door; kicked in the back door; broke into his gun safe; threw personal papers around the house; spilled boxes of ammunition on the floor; broke into a small, locked box that contained precious coins; stood on a table to peer through the ceiling tiles, breaking the table in the process.  Then, they left.  The doors were closed but not latched, much less locked.  The ammo and guns were left unsecured.    "My front and back doors were pulled shut, but they were busted through and couldn't latch.  Anybody could have waltzed in there and stolen everything I own.  A child could have taken a gun.  The guns, the safe -- everything was open and laying around.  I keep all my magazines empty, but someone had loaded them.  While I was looking around in amazement, the gas, electric and water companies show up to turn the power off.  They said they were told to shut things down. Then I found the note.  "Nothing Found - ATF."    "They didn't make any attempt to notify me.  I've lived in Tulsa all my life and never got more than a traffic ticket.  How come they can't look that up, realize I've been law-abiding my whole life, then come to the door when I'm home?  They didn't leave someone here to watch over my private property.  They didn't even come by to explain what happened.  They just raided my home, ransaked it, left it wide open and left."    Lawmaster placed a phone call to the local BATF agent.  "I asked, 'Are you gonna' arrest me?' and he said, 'No.'  I asken him, "Who is going to repair and clean up my house?'  And he said, "If you're going to talk to me, come down to my office.'    "'I can't come down!' I said.  'My doors are broken!'  If I had been on vacation and I didn't have friendly neighbors, I would have lost everything I own.  Here I am a competent, responsible firearms owner, and the government leaves them open, unlocked, with ammo strewn around."    Lawmaster said the agent advised him, "If you want your door to lock and your gun safe to lock, you're gonna' have to pay for it yourself."    "'Oh, I'll come right down, alright,' I told him.  'I'll come down, but I'll bring my attorney.'  And he said, 'Well, you bring your attorney, and we won't talk to you.'"So if you don't want your tea party to be held in awkward silence, makesure your lawyer isn't there, there's a good chap.> It's very sad all those people died, especially the kids, but that's going> to happen in a free society whenever psychologically needy people hook up> with a charismatic nutcase.What a repulsive outlook on society.

The cops now rank just a narrow notch below the militaryin communications, intelligence gathering and firepower.In a similar vein, the amount of marijuana smuggled intothis country has greatly decreased. This is because itsvalue-per-pound is very low when compared to cocaine orheroin. It's simply not worth the risk, it's uneconomical.Now, most reefer is domestic. There is less pressure onthe domestic producer (showy raids notwithstanding) andthus it is economical. Of note though ... domestic reeferis now very strong, so a small volume goes a long way.You cannot make alcohol stronger than 200 proof - not agood dollar/pound deal. Firearms tend to fall into this low dollar/pound area.It would not be economic to smuggle them in. All productionwould have to be local.

 27"Freed om of Religion" has absolutely nothing to do with building a smallarsenal and grooming 10-year old children to be your wife. "I'll come outas soon as I finish my manuscript on the Seven Seals." Oh, OK, David.I agree that Koresh was as much of a victim as a perpetrator; this becausehe grew up inside the cult, and engaged in a power struggle where hissupporters helped inflate his ego.That doesn't change the fact that he was a loose fucking cannon with ashitload of serious weapons. Or that he was banging thirteen year olds andtwisting their impressionable little minds.This was no MOVE fuck-up. A helicoptor was thermal-imaging the compoundthat afternoon and detected three fires erupting almost simultaneously.There were no CS CANISTERS... a specially modified Abrams was pupming thestuff in. No chance of starting a fire there. Kerosene lamps? Maybe one,but not three fires. No way. Koresh wasn't just talking out of his ass. Iexpected this to happen.Maybe they WANTED it to look like murder. He had 50+ days. I think this wascoming the whole time. He didn't even put the children in the buried bus orthe underground bunker during the CS seige. He put them up into the towerto die. Fuck all of you "Big Brother" paranoid freaks.

The Jews who found themselves alone againstRome on Masada faced a future which was infinitely bleaker than the onefaced by the Branch Davidians. The latter, in reality, would likelyhave been charged with weapons violations and other sorts of crimes.Most of them would have likely gotten off entirely. It is highlyunlikely that anyone other than Vernon Howell would have been beenimprisoned for very long. But regardless, most of the people, andcertainly all of the children, would have been allowed to leave, and ifthey so chose, join another cult.The Jews on Masada well understood their likely fate from what hadalready happened. Had they surrendered, the men of fighting age wouldprobably have been put to death, perhaps crucified.  The women andchildren would have been enslaved. None of them would have been likelyto practice their religion again.I understand that Howell/Koresh and perhaps others will argue that thefate of the Branch Davidians was "equally" onerous and that they werefighting for religious freedom.

Yeah, the liberal press doesn't like us much, but you can't reallyexpect coherent thought from them anyway. Their opinions are basedmore on a desire to appear politically correct than on facts (whichare generously provided by the FBI, if they'd bother to put on theirBirkenstocks and go to the library to read them). Most of my friendsare anti-gun, and without exception NONE of them bases his/her opinionson facts. They would rather believe (despite all evidence to thecontrary) that disarming law-abiding citizens would make the worldmore civilized, when all it really does is make us all sheep. They would rather wallow in their pitiful liberal white guilt about howsociety has driven the criminal to rob, rape, and murder. They support spending millions of public dollars protecting the rights of scumwho have already demonstrated that they have no regard for societyor its laws. They ignore the fact that areas with the strictest guncontrol (NYC,DC) have the worst crime and areas with little guncontrol (VT,NH,ID) have very little crime in comparison. But theyhave to ignore this because otherwise they would need to confrontthe fact that law-abiding citizens who own guns are not the ones thatare causing most of the trouble in society. Oh no, we certainly can'taccept that! But I guess I have faith that when crime starts makingsignificant inroads into their neighborhoods and starts directlyhurting them and their families, they will probably whistle a differenttune.

 23Nntp-Posting-Host: plains.nodak.eduJust to shed some light on the fire, it was widely reported (AP, etc.) thatthere WERE several witnesses to BD folks starting the fires.  It has alsobeen reported that the fires broke out in several places at once, whichrules out a Bradley knocking over a lamp, etc. as the cause.What I would like to see is some serious discussion of this incident.  Ibelieve the moves made were right and proper, but I still have some problemswith some of the tactics.  After watching the ABC special on it tonight, aswell as CNN and Nightline, I question some of the ATF and FBI actions.1) Could it have been possible to have taken Koresh outside the compound atsome time before the Feb. 28th raid?2) Could a further wait have resulted in a different outcome.3) Were FBI actions (blaring loudspeakers, etc.) the "right" course of action?And a few other questions.  Like I said, I believe the actions taken, ingeneral, were proper.  But I still have some reservations.One other point, I'm no fan of Janet Reno, but I do like the way she had the"balls" to go ahead and take full responsibility.  Seems like the waffle boyhad problems figuring out just where he stood on the issue.

 108Posted for L. Neil Smith by Cathy Smith                         THE LIES OF TEXASOkay, what have we learned?For reasons still being kept secret, a federal agency already known -- well enough to be examined and rebuked by several legislative committees over the years -- for a longstanding, violent disregardof the law, invades the home of a man whose religious beliefs and personal habits they abominate, violating his rights under the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. The man and his followers fight back, killing four of the outlaw agency's minions, wounding many more, and suffering their own losses in the process. The agency responds by cutting off his electricity, water, and especially his contact with the outside world. They are then free to say anything at all about him -- in pronouncements that contradict one another daily as the agency finds itself locked in a bitter power struggle with another outfit eager to gain credit for "straightening out the mess" -- and, more importantly, to script his side of the subsequent "negotiations" any way they please. The impasse lasts almost two months, ironically, at the same time four L.A. cops are being given a second trial for brutalizing a single individual, sparking one of the ugliest riots in history. Armored vehicles surround the house, already ringed with snipers using scoped, high-powered rifles. Loudspeakers playing obnoxious records at the highest possible volume, and searchlights, deprive those in the house of sleep (in the aftermath, nobody in authority will mention the effect this technique, originated by North Korean Communists as a battle tactic, may have had on their judgment). Finally -- another irony -- on the 50th anniversary of the rising of the Warsaw Ghetto, some of the armor punches holes in the house and gas of some kind is injected. The house bursts into flame and is reduced to ashes in less than an hour. At least 80 lives, including those of more than a dozen children, are snuffed out. Spokesmen for the outlaw agencies, the Attorney General, and the President all hold press conferences to articulate a common theme: blame the victim. He had illegal weapons -- as soon as they can be prepared in a secret government workshop and planted among the cinders being "examined" by the agency that created them. He was abusing children -- the tapes will be stored with the data on the JFK assassination. He set the fire -- our snipers saw him doing it. Film at 11 -- in 3000 A.D. He shot his followers who tried to escape -- or was that Jim Jones? Best of all, he's dead -- he can't say a damn thing to embarrass us, any more than when his contact with the world was severed at the start of the whole travesty. A leading national paper claims 93% of the American people believe that a man who resisted a savage attack on his home is somehow responsible for everything that resulted. But when did you ever know 93% of Americans to agree on anything -- doesn't this sound more like the outcome of a Soviet election than an opinion poll? Very well, what can we infer from the above? For starters, never forget that, although Democratic careers are on the line (and rightfully so) over this fiasco, by the outlaw agency's admission, it was planned and rehearsed by a Republican administration. Which may explain why Paul Harvey, who evidently used up all his courage and integrity changing his mind (at about the same time I did) about the war in Viet Nam -- has been acting as little more than a mouthpiece for a state that has no regard for the Bill of Rights. More importantly, when Rush Limbaugh, who's been a quivering tower of Jello during the whole thing, takes essentially the same stance as Bill Clinton, it's time for fundamental changes, if not in the system, then at least within yourself. On March 5, back at the beginning, Mary Gingell, national chair of the Libertarian Party, issued a press release condemning the outlaw agency and calling for its abolition. In fact, the LP has promised in its platform since 1977, for at least 16 years, to abolish both agencies involved in Waco. I'm proud to say I was there and helped to write that plank. True, the LP is tiny and insignificant (although less so than in 1977 -- ask the Democrats in Georgia if you doubt it). But, alone in a howling wilderness of fascists scrambling now to cover their behinds with phony polls and Big Lies, the LP is right about what happened in Waco. And if their advice had been followed in 1977, Waco never would have happened. Think about it. And think about the fact that, if you've had enough of political parties more interested in collecting and holding power -- at whatever cost to the Bill of Rights, let alone human life -- than in defending and expanding individual liberty, maybe the change it's time for within yourself is to make the LP less tiny and insignificant by a single voice and a single vote.Think about it.L.

Mr. Parsli, I have to take exception at this.  There areverifiable, previous *examples* of levels of U.S. governmentsabusing gun-control restrictions.

But as long as the politicians grab power to sellpork back to their constituents, there's not a lot I can do.         It's silly to suggest that if there's anything we can't trustthe government to do, and therefore the government should be allowedto do it, then we should change governments.  Down that road liestotal government power.   I've never been a fan of totalitarianism.>Guns 'n Criminals:>MOST weapons used by criminals today are stolen.       This is very likely.>Known criminals can NOT buy weapons, that's one of the points of gun control.>And because gun control are strict in WHOLE scandinavia (and most of europe),>we dont have any PROBLEM with smuggled guns.       The North American Continent is not Europe, no matter how manypeople would like it to be.  Drugs are very illegal and they'rehere.  For years Canada has crowed about its gun control.  If it isnecessary to control guns over the whole continent, then Canada shouldhave always had comparable rates to the U.S., yet they still don't.Unless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much moremagical than the Mexican border (which is shorter and far moreheavily patrolled) then I really can't accept that argument.>Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one:>What I meant was that cars CAN kill, but they are not GUNS!       No, there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the U.S.,two-thirds of which are suicides.  (Unfortunately I don't have suiciderates for Norway.)  However, this makes the per-gun death rate abouthalf the per-car death rate.>The issue (I hope..):>I think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem.>Guns are not a problem, but the way they are used is.... (and what are they for??)>>I think this discusion is interesting when you think of (ex)Jugoslavia:>They should all have weapons, it's their rigth to have them, and if they use them>to kill other (Innocent) people the problem is humans, not guns.      The problem's been humans since before we had stone axes.  Thefct of the matter is simply this:  If nobody ever assaulted anybody,whether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totallyirrelevent.      Yet weapons are *built*.  I'd suggest, then, that the murderousimpulse in humanity pre-dates weapons.      Anyway, the Bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attemptto kill each other for half a thousand years.  Taking away their guns, evenif we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality.>If 50% of ALL murders was done with axes, would you impose some regulations on them>or just say that they are ment to be used at trees, and that the axe is not a problem,>it's the 'axer' ??>(An example, don't flame me just because not exactly 50% are killed by guns...)       In the U.S., approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms.(50% with handguns, 10% with non-handguns.)  The reason I say that guns, per se, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe'scountries *entire* violent crime rate.  I don't really think we've gotmore knives or fists.         In any case, I think examples of gun control *applied* to the U.S.have been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other formsof prohibition.  Until you deal with *why* people are doing what theyare doing, you won't solve your problem.  And if the problem is violent crime, you shouldn't concentrate on the tools instead.  The*vast* majority of guns is never, ever misused.  (On the order of99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun).  This says to me thatyou can't make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse.>Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect>themselves. Is this a good situation ??        The situation is not "good" in that people fear for their lives.But recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots,protecting their shops with guns.  Would it have been better they,too, lost their livelihoods?>Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem ??       The problem of poverty and rage in Los Angeles, no it isn't.However, if that problem becomes a violent action, then yes, it canbe appropriate.  Whether or not some person has been hurt by their conditionwon't make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it.       You have to examine which problem you're referring to.  Ifyou're discussing someone violently assaulting you, then it isa perfectly legitimate response to make them stop.  (Hopefullysimply letting them know you're prepared to shoot them would be enough,as it was with the above-mentioned store-owners.)>If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals (and their neighbor who have>guns) what do you think will happen ?? (I mean if everybody had a gun in USA)       45% of Households have some form of firearm, usually a long gun.That accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million Americans.Firearm ownership is most likely among educated, well-off whites, thegroup *least* likely to be involved in violent crime.

Sounds a bit>>tacky, but hey, whatever works.As David Veal points out, this sort of "promotion" would be usedagainst gun owners by the mass media.However, here is my proposal: offer gun safety classes in your area,free, as a community service.  Such a class would normally cost $40or $50, so offering it free is a good promotion.Our Gun Club has organized several of these (we just finishedteaching another one last night, in fact) and they have beenvery well received.  We get a lot of people who are novicesinterested in guns.  We even get a few who are anti-gun, butfeel they should know something about "gun safety" since membersof their family keep guns at home.Teaching such a course gives us many desirable benefits:(1) We have the chance to teach gun safety rules; this increases    firearm awareness and may help to reduce gun accident stats.(2) A "gun safety" class is Politically Correct, and likely to    be viewed positively by the public and the media.(3) Most of the students are 'normal people' (not gun enthusiasts)    and this kind of class gives us the chance to give them a    gentle introduction to firearms.(4) Some of the students are enthusiastic, and will purchase a gun    and become more involved in shooting or personal defense.(5) It improves the public perception of our club and gun owners    in general.  Our students see that we are all reasonable,    non-aggressive, soft-spoken people, which helps to mitigate    the standard image of a hardcore gun owner.  Even anti-gun    students sometimes tell us they have "something new to think    about" with regards to personal gun ownership.(6) Sharing our experience with others is a lot of fun.Our course is the standard NRA-certified "Home Firearm Safety"class, and our students pay only $5 for materials.  We alsoteach the NRA's "Personal Protection" class, although the costis higher for that one since we have to purchase range time.I think firearms safety classes are an excellent response togun buy-backs.                               -- Alane --   /-----------------------------------------------------------------\\  /   NOBODY shares my opinions,    |    "I am a jelly doughnut"      \\ /    especially not my employer    |    -- President John F Kennedy   \\/-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\

You are not making sense.You seem to have no concern that someone would keep children inside this compound when they had 51 days to let them out.

I would defend my home, loved ones and country, but I don't view guns asneccities or toys.I HAVE done army service, and HAVE used a variaty of weapons, but wouldn'twant to have one for self defence or because they 'feel good'....This is not a .signature.It's marly a computergenerated text to waste bandwithand to bring down the evil Internet.

 14Hi,In Canada, any gun that enters a National Park must be sealed (I think it's asmall metal tag that's placed over the trigger).  The net result of this isthat you _can't_ use a gun to protect yourself from bears (or psychos) in theNational Parks.  Instead, one has to be sensitive to the dangers and annoyancesof hiking in bear country, and take the appropriate precautions.I think this policy makes the users of the National Parks feel a little closerto Nature, that they are a part of Nature and, as such, have to deal withnature on it's own terms.Guy

Miller was convicted of owning a sawed-off shotgun and not paying theNFA '34 tax.

It must be interpreted and applied with that end in view."The militia includes "all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense."However, regarding sawed-off shotguns, "certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.""Judicial notice" is the term of art here -- it meant that no suchevidence had been formally presented.

Here is my quandary:  you seem to be arguing that certain types of guns fall outside the scope of the Second.  This isn't a useful argument unless you believe that some significant gun or class of gun belongsin that class.  I think we both agree that zip guns probably aren't protected.  Maybe we also both agree that all the weapons that random state governments have been banning or trying to ban because they have "no sporting purpose" and "no provate citizen would ever need these guns" DO fall under the protection of the Second.  So, given that damn near any gun of any practical utility is or has at some time been used by the military, even if only for marksmanship training purposes, I need to understand why you are intent on pressing this point, arguing that that SOMETHING is not protected by the Second.> Just because I don't whole-heartedly endorse the NRA position does not> mean that I oppose the RKBA.

They don`t believeReno or the President have any guilt in ordering/allowing the attack.I suppose they also believed things like:"I would present a 5-year plan to balance the budget.""We don`t need to lead with a tax increase....""It starts with a middle-class tax cut...""I`ll have the bills ready the day after I am inaugurated and we`llhave a 100 day period....It will be the most productive in modern history.""I will ask congress for a line item veto..""I will lift the social security earnings test.."I personally prefer to disbelieve the government until they prove themselvesright, rather than the other way around.

Each side is committed to overstating the problem it addresses.  For the procontrol forces, that problem is the contribution of guns to violence and crime, while for the anticontrol forces, that problem is the procontrol forces...  Each set of advocacy group serves as the demon by which the other side can rally the troops, raising morale and money.  The public is not enlightened by this war of words because neither set of advocates has any stake in merely presenting the plain, unvarnished truth, even to the extent that flawed and biased human minds can understand it.  Quite the contrary -- to tell the truth and nothing but the truth would place one side at a distinct disadvantage if the other side did not also lay down their propaganda weapons."

Unfortunately, the states relinquished their own, independent militia units to the National Guard -- which can be "federalized" into Army service by the President at any time -- in their hunger for federalfunds.  And it was the STATES -- not the gun owners -- who passed laws against "private citizens engaging in martial drill."So, many gun owners train to the remaining lawful limit, which trainingis almost exclusively administered by the NRA -- not the states, notthe feds.

 40Ever since the siege at Waco started the FBI spokesman has beenstressing how unstable and paranoid David Koresh was.  He stressed howlikely it was the the Branch Davidians would commit mass suicide.  Hewas concerned with the safety of the children. What did the FBI do to defuse the situation,  Did they try to reassureKoresh?  DId the FBI offer medical assistance to the BD?  Did the FBIoffer them a supply of water when the BD pump stoped working?  Did thepermit Koresh to communicate with anyone outside the compound? What the FBI did was harass the Branch Davidians as much as possible.They kept powerful lights shining on the compound, shut off theirelectrical power, put their pump out of action, assaulted their earswith loud noise, cut off their communication with the outside and keptlimiting their permitter.  The stated goal was to put pressure onDavid Koresh. Was the FBI attempting to get Koresh to surrender or were they hopingto get Koresh so mad that he and some of his followers would attackthe the tanks. It appears that the tactics employed by the FBI did drive Koresh overthe edge.  The blame for the deaths should be shared by both thefederal experts whose tactics drove Koresh over the edge and the foolsat the ATF who planed the raid. Stupidity and incompetence of the BATF and the FBI leadership haveresulted in the needless death of 90 innocent people. If every thing had gone as planned 90 people would be alive today.Instead the ATF screwed up and caused the death of 90+.

If|> Jesus did in fact command his disciples to arm themselves, I would|> take that as yet another reason to reject Christian doctrine, for|> whatever it's worth.|> Let me clarify.  In order to more clearly understand scripture, one mustlook in the context of where the verse is found.  The section you referto here is found in Luke 22.  I'd like to start back at verse 35 and I'llinclude it here for the sake of completeness:   Then Jesus asked them, "When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals,   did you lack anything?"   "Nothing." the disciples replied.Verse 36 says:  "But now, if you have a purse take it and also a bag; and    if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.  It is written,    "And he was numbered with the transgressors."Verse 38 says:  The disciples said, "See, Lord, here are two swords."                "That is enough."  he replied.What does this all mean? In verse 35, Jesus points out to the disciples that when he sent them outpreviously, they did not need to take anything with them.  Their food,lodging and transport were often provided through the generosity of others.If verse 36, Jesus alludes to the change in attitude that is to come in thenear future.  Remember, Jesus was saying these things shortly before he wasto be arrested.  In verse 36, He tells the disciples that they will haveto take their own possessions and provisions with them.  THey will have tocarry their own purse because there will be no longer any generosity fromanyone.  And there will be times of peril when they will have to take careof themselves.  This was implied by the reference to the sword.  Jesus knewthat He was going to be arrested and labeled as a criminal.  The chargesbrought against Him were likely to be passed on to his disciples.In verse 38, we see that the disciples have taken Jesus too literally.  It isnot the first time that the disciples got His message wrong.  They had done this on several occassions.  Instead of understanding the gist of His words,they presented Him with two swords.  Jesus was perhaps taken aback bythis promptly concludes the discussion by saying, "That is enough."The disciples could not understand why Jesus had to die.  Jesus kept tellingthem over and over again that He would soon not be with them but they couldnot grasp this.  They wanted their Messiah to be a political leader who wouldlead them in rebellion against the Romans.  That is why they were so keen onpresenting Him with the swords.  They had no idea that Jesus was referring toa different kingdom of which they were to be a part of.  The disciples couldonly perceive of a kingdom on earth rather than the one in Heaven.Understand that Jesus NEVER intended his followers to take up arms in rebellion.This was clearly in evidence in Luke 22:51 when Jesus rebuked his disciples for using the sword against the servant of the high priest when they came to arrest Him.  As further evidence, Jesus goes so far as to heal the man injured by the disciples.  Jesus did NOT condone violence as a means for His purpose.Contrast this behaviour with that of David Koresh and you will clearly see thatDK was NOT Jesus as he claimed.  Jesus surrendered himself to the authouritiesand allowed himself to be crucified.  He didn't go out in a blaze of glory, butrather Jesus was executed like a common criminal.  I hope this makes it a little more clear.God be with you,Malcolm Lee  :)|> >>Well, when the nice federal officers come to my house to check out my|> >>extensive weapons cache, I'll just be sure not to shoot at them.|> >>"Tea, ladies and gentlemen?"|> |> >Actually, that's pretty much wht the "Branch Davidian" siad when|> >the local Sherrif knocked on their door.|> >Of course, when armed men assaulted them without warrning, it was a|> >different matter...|> |> Why?

Yes, its a horrible way to go, but apparently notso horrible that someone with enough religious conviction might not be able to carry it through. And, since they've discovered bullet wounds in a couple of the bodies from the compound, there is the possiblity that those with the will power to self immolate also had the will power to take out the ones who hadless constitutional fortitude. Then again, maybe the FBI ran in while the firewas raging, executed those two, and ran out again.Jason DurbinOracle Europe

 131Message-ID: <OAF.93Apr21181038@klosters.ai.mit.edu>Reply-To: oaf@zurich.ai.mit.eduNNTP-Posting-Host: klosters.ai.mit.eduIn the wake of the Waco denouement, I had email discussions withpeople from this group.  In particular, we discussed how cultsoperate, why the FBI might be motivated to black out news or behavethe way it did, and what kinds of problems are involved in dealingwith cults and similar organizations.I include an edited account of what I wrote.  The identity of mycorrespondents have (I hope) been erased.  The editing process makesthe text choppy - sorry about that.  I've tried to retain theinformation content.Ellipses (...) indicate where text was removed.  A few of the commentsin parentheses are new, intended to make it easier for outsiders tounderstand.These notes are preliminary - feel free to criticize.Cheers(?),Oded------------------------ (begin included text) -----------------------I took a course called the MADNESS OF CROWDS, ...  The course includedcults and briefly mentioned/analyzed Jonestown.  (Did some externalreading too).William Adorno ... edited a series of books on the psychology of"evil" mass movements...  starting with THE AUTHORITARIAN PERSONALITY,University of Chicago Press, 1948 ... an attempt to figure out whatwould motivate people to support fascism or be the bad guys in WWII,and by extension in other wars, in racial lynchings ...  I don't thinkthe books are perfect, and the study of psychopathology has advanced..., but you can elicit Koresh types from even the first volume.  So Ithink they're onto something.----------------------------------------------------------------------How cult psychology works...[I'm an amateur.  Hope I'm not hopelessly naive.]So long as Koresh could "own" his people, he made sure they didn'tbelieve there was any life out there for them, away from him.Otherwise, he'd (Koresh) be nothing.  During the siege, ex-Davidiansrecounted how he convinced the people in the compound they survivedonly through his intercession with God to spare their worthless souls.Absolutely classic brainwashing technique. ...  As long as theybelieved him, they'd ignore BATF/FBI/Child Protective Services or eventhe Red Cross asking them to come out.  After all, if they ever lefthim, God would catapult them straight to Hell, and the combined forcesof the US gummint, with all the goodwill in the world (doubtful)couldn't save them for a second.  If I believed it, I'd stay and dietoo, like the folks in Jonestown.For a prosaic analogy, replace a cult leader with an estranged wife(or husband), and notice how many folks show up, kill the ex and thenthemselves.  That's the consequence of shattered "cultism."  It reallydoes happen all the time.  [By the way, the treasured ideal in suchcases, without which life is meaningless, is the relationship, nomatter how abusive, rather than the individual's partner.]...----------------------------------------------------------------------    [Why No News, Don't The Feds Owe The World An Explanation?]I agree that official explanations are in order.  I can also see good(?)  reasons for news blackouts.>The only fact available is that had the FBI not acted  >yesterday, those people would be alive today. ... that no matter what, those people would have died, because Koreshmade sure they believed they had no lives outside his influence.Hence it would make little difference when or how the FBI acted.  Heheld them hostage, as his trump against going to jail, but nothingwould really stop him from offing them.  Even if the FBI went away!Look at history.  Rep Leo Ryan (and some staffers) visited Jonestown,at the request of constituents who had relatives there.  OnceJonestown was discovered, and even though they killed Ryan and hisentourage ... they all killed themselves, because Jim Jones knew he'dbe busted.  Internal arguments asking to spare the children, broughtup by some of the women in the cult, were shouted down.  There aretapes...  The "logic" of saying that no matter how bad the gummint is, itwouldn't kill the kids, was shouted down as blasphemy, and the peoplewho brought it up were threatened with ostracism by people who byTHEIR OWN AVOWAL would be dead within the hour.  I suspect it's thesame with the Branch Davidians.(There's a book on Jonestown by James Reston Jr., titled OUR FATHERWHO ART IN HELL.  I don't know whether it's good - never read it.)...The only way to prevent such a problem would be never to investigatereports of child abuse or sexual mistreatment, or organizations buyingfull-auto conversion kits or shipping hand grenades via UPS, on theoff chance of stumbling across cults that would kill themselves. ...So, the only way the BATF/FBI could "save" those people, and futurecults, is by ignoring such signs.I suppose there's another way - outsmarting Koresh and tricking himinto letting them go, or somehow influencing "his" people to abandonhim while he owns most of their means of communication with the world.... a mighty tough row to hoe. ...  I suspect the FBI tried to do thatwith blackouts, noise and other sensory insults.  However, maybethey're not very sophisticated, or maybe the job is impossible.  It'scertainly possible the guy running the show was a jerk....----------------------------------------------------------------------[Why the FBI might want to blackout during and coverup after]    ... - if they were doing a poor job of weaning the BD's fromKoresh, they'd want to keep it quiet so they wouldn't be embarrassed.    ... - if they were trying to wean the BD's from Koresh, they'dwant to keep it quiet so he couldn't outflank them, or well-meaningboneheads from ANY point of view wouldn't screw it up. ...  I _hate_playing chess when the world screams in my face, especially if atcheckmate time people really die, and I could be blamed....I don't think ignoring such incidents is a workable policy, unless youdeny the FBI, BATF, Child Protective Services (of whatever stripe) andthe rest of the gummint should exist at all. (the end)----------------------------------------------------------------------  Okay, have at it.
 208April 19, 1993 As William O. Douglas noted, "If a powerful sponsor is lacking,individual liberty withers -- in spite of glowing opinions andresounding constitutional phrases." The legislative scorecard outlined below resulted from subcommittee,committee, and floor action.  Many important victories, however, comefrom coordinating with legislators to ensure anti-gun/anti-huntinglegislation is either amended favorably, rejected, or never voted.These quiet victories are no less impressive in protecting ourfundamental civil liberties guaranteed by the Second Amendment to theU.S. Constitution.   **** Arizona - SB 1233, NRA-supported legislation concerning minors incriminal possession of firearms  passed the House 36-18, is currentlyawaiting action by the Governor. Arkansas - HB 1447, Firearms Preemption Legislation was signed by theGovernor making this the forty-first state to pass preemption.Preemption had passed twice in previous sessions only to be vetoed bythen Gov. Bill Clinton.  HB 1417, mandatory storage of firearms,amended and then killed in committee. Colorado - SB 42, mandating the storage of firearms with atrigger-lock, killed in committee.  SB 104,  prohibiting the sale ofcertain semi-auto firearms was killed in committee.  SB 108,so-called Colorado Handgun Violence Prevention Act, including aprovision for a 10-day waiting period, killed in committee. Connecticut - Substitute Bill No. 6372, imposing a 6% tax on allfirearms, ammunition, and archery equipment killed in EnvironmentCommittee. Florida - A bill to require a 3-year license at a cost of $150 to ownor possess semi-automatic firearms with a second degree felonyprovision (15 years in prison) died in committee along with numerousother anti-gun owner bills.  No anti-gun legislation passed inFlorida this year. Georgia - SB 12, supposed instant check with provision allowing forup to a 7-day "waiting period,"  defeated in House Public SafetyCommittee and sent to Interim Study committee.  Mandatory storagebill -- SB 247 -- was defeated 39-15 in the Senate.  The same billpassed the upper-House 52-2 in 1992.  Illinois - HB 90, prohibiting the sale, possession, manufacture,purchase, possession, or carrying of certain semi-auto firearms, wasdefeated in House Judiciary II Subcommittee on Firearms. HB 91,mandatory storage legislation, failed in House Judiciary Subcommitteeon Firearms. HB 1550, repeals FOID and makes FTIP, point of salecheck permanent, passed out of Judiciary Committee by a 10-4-2 vote.Presently on the calendar for third reading in the House. SB 40, mandatory storage bill, defeated in committee.SB 265, imposing a handgun excise tax, failed in Senate committee onRevenue's Subcommittee on Tax Increases.SB 272,imposing a tax on all persons engaged in the business ofselling firearms, failed in Senate Revenue Committee's Subcommitteeon Tax Increases. Indiana - SB 241, Statewide Firearms Preemption, passed in the Senate34-16, and in the House 77-22.  Twelve amendments were introduced onthe House floor to SB 241.  Among these amendments were a ban oncertain semi-auto firearms, Mandatory Storage, Trigger-Lock, a ban on"Saturday Night Specials" (Similar to 1988 Maryland Bill), andHandgun Rationing (one handgun per month).  All were defeated.[I read this morning (4/20) S.B. 241 was defeated -- lvc] Kansas - HB 2435, providing for a 72-hour waiting period on allfirearms was defeated in committee.  HB 2458, presently on theGovernor's desk, HB 2459 and SB 243 and 266 all relating to victims'rights, are expected to be enacted into law. Maine - Funding for the Department of Fish and Wildlife 1993-94budget, was restored following severe  reductions in the Governor'sproposed budget.

Wisconsin - In a referendum up against all odds, the determinedefforts of the Madison Area Citizens Against Crime paid off on April6 when a nonbinding referendum banning the possession of handguns inMadison, Wisconsin, was defeated.  Despite opposition to the ban --aired largely by firearms owners at a series of public meetings onthe issue -- the Common Council voted on February 17 to place thereferendum on the ballot, allowing only seven weeks of campaigning toreverse public opinion on the controversial issue. An October 1992 poll conducted by the Wisconsin State Journal found57% in support and 38% opposed, with 5% expressing no opinion.  Byelection day, of the more than 56,000 voters who went to the polls,51% cast ballots in opposition to the proposal while 49% voted tohave the Madison Common Council enact such a ban.  The campaigncommittee, spearheaded by the Wisconsin Pro-Gun Movement and NRA-ILA,relied on neighborhood canvassing, direct mail and radio/TVadvertising to educate voters on the civil liberties implicationsraised by enforcement of the ban if the referendum was approved. Despite the surprising defeat, it is expected that the Madisoninitiative's chief proponent, Mayor Paul Soglin, will attempt to havethe Common Council enact an ordinance banning handguns.

The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking.                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyramwere murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split overwho to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just likeMohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims considerChrist to be a prophet the same as Jews, I'm led to understand.  Makeno mistake, this was no messiah we're talking about in Smith).  Thethought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handeddown father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was onlyentering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to havebeen bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  TheCouncil of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn't of much helphere, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects.Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waitedfor Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The otherclaimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)Both sects practiced the "1-year food stockpile" doctrine,and this being frontier and farming country most carried or atleast owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were amilitaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather thanface large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered agreat deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quitejustified in making military training a good thing.  Remember,this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these peoplehad nobody to turn to save themselves.Just a little context to put this all in perspective.>So what did the Mormons get?

LDS and RLDSphilosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the trueChurch as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on hisown merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS mayas well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  Youcan only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejectedit.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans toBuddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong theywill not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hooverliked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbadealcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like.These people are the "salt of the Earth" and as such are moreeasily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.That's my somewhat educated guess, anyway.  Both sects havesplinter groups that don't mirror the masses, but these are smalland rare, and hardly worth noting their common ancestry.None of this has any relevance to guns, though.

In a situation where only oneset of facts are being presented, "coming to a conclusion" is not the hallmark of an independent thinker unless it's coupled with the abilityto challenge those "facts" critically.

Any Messianic pretenderwould tell his followers to get ready for war, since theywere going to throw the Romans out of Judaea and free theIsraelites.For those interested, Bar Kochba's claim was taken far moreseriously than Jesus' among the Jews.  They revolted and600,000 were slaughtered by the Romans.  His claim was onlyrejected after his defeat, although for a short time he lookedas though he would win.  They even got to mint coins beforethe Romans triumphed.Now how that has played into Christianity is rather interestinggiven your use of the statement attributed to Jesus.  Did Koreshfigure he had to get rid of the US government to free Israel?Had he the foggiest notion of who are todays descendants ofthe Israelites?

 26OK, here's something for all of those people who think cops are alwaysmore responsible then the rest of the population.  I found this article in theRocky Mountain Collegian, Colorado State University's newspaper.SUSPENDED POLICE OFFICER ARRESTED IN REVENGE TRIPLE HOMICIDEPROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- A police officer afraid he would be fired forallegedly assaulting a teen-ager walked into an auto body shop wher the youthworked, said "You're going to die" and fatally shot him and two others, policesaid.A fourth youth was wounded.  A fifth escaped injury by hiding under a car.The wounded youth ran about two blocks to a house after the shooting at aboutmidnight Tuesday and called police.  He was hospitalized in satisfactorycondition Wednesday.Suspended police officer Robert Sabetta, 23, of Cranston, was arrested atgunpoint over three hours after the shooting at Wilson's Auto Enterprises inFoster, a rural town of about 4,000 people in northwest Rhode Island.Well, this just goes to show that cops are capable of snapping, justlike everyone else.  Now who was it who said only cops should have guns?Doug Holland

 263Distribution: usaMessage-ID: <1ql04g$l39@transfer.stratus.com>References: <1qkq65$l39@transfer.stratus.com>NNTP-Posting-Host: rocket.sw.stratus.com[This is a co-authored report from two of us who were there.]Gun Owners Action League, our state rifle association, started the daywith a rally in the secluded courtyard behind the statehouse at 9:30.It was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began,whereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers fromwherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud.Mike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was toremind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had beenchecked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while thepeople in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of"election fraud" to hold their jobs.Nancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons andsheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, andtelling people where to find their own representatives (and in toomany cases, who they were).Mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules anddiscuss a bill that hadn't made it onto the official list.  It seems adelegation of students from Simon's Rock of Bard College (alma materof Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) wasbeing bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms orammo to anyone who is not a state resident.The hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) GardnerAuditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor'shearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusivehusbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonholeour representatives, after which we would be squashed into aninadequate hearing room.One of my representatives' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy.He said, "Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby isalways so organized every year."  I got a little pissed, and replied,"I'm not from the gun lobby -- I'm from your district."At 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice ademonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where thepro-gunners weren't).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in hismirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, andseveral Simon's Rock anti-gun "close-the-loophole" protestors.(Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)The room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there wereabout 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachersfrom Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never gotcloser than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  Acop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of thecrowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeakerwas set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.Everyone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheetsaying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed upto "support GOAL's position" on "all bills."First, because of their time constraints, public officials got totestify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the studentshad some curfew, I guess).  Currently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase longguns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws ofhis own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only tonon-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon's Rockfolks called the current law a "loophole" and wanted it closed.Two of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his "SKS assault rifle."The second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so wellthat he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo's home state) with Missouri,and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallerycorrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimedthat the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he waslying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoiningstates ONLY if they have licensing in their own state "as strong as"that in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that's that.Some of the things these two said were really offensive.  "In some ofthese other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he's breathing!"(Oooooo!)  "We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; ifonly the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn'tbe having this situation -- but they won't."  (Naughty, naughty!)Next up was Boston city councilman Albert "Dapper" O'Neill.  He wasthere to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He'sreasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he'salmost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed theACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he werejudge, he'd give arrestees their "last rights" (pun intended) on thespot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.)He said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in theright direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(Two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind aCCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed arestraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restrainingorder requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction-- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favorof it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying,"I'm sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have toget these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts haveconvicted."  I haven't seen such a disgustingly disingenuousperformance since Nixon whined that he wasn't a crook.Barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewableevery five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The statedpurpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible."Revenue has nothing to do with it."  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, somecongressmen think we're stupid enough to swallow the argument thatit's preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in thevague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamncard away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle thelaw-abiding instead of the crook.The two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga.Jujuga didn't say much (he was a co-sponsor of both "restrainingorder" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn't let anybad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He was a co-sponsor of one of the "restraining order" bills as well.)  Oneof the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) wasvociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was inthe right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, "everyyear it's the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap..."It's nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have beenmore effective.At about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn't continue.Someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop becausethe loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker wasdisconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us hadto leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the "public"testimony; the other got a seat this time.Caron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left thestate, and then returned without notifying them of his address change.He complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and thathis PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Greatquote: "If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the statecomputer system until 1999."  (This was also an argument he usedagainst the renewable FID card.)Testimony was heard from several "battered women," one of whom hadbeen attacked by some guy in his 20's who had an FID card because hegot it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion andsaid how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney GeneralHarshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these womenneeded to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order wasgranted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whetherthe order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would besatisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing ratherthan after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some longrambling circumlocution in response.Then testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who lookssomething like Einstein) got up and made the point that restrainingorders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issuerestraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who theythink is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restrainingorders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts.Atty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.Other pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file arestraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that shecountered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would haveallowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law.One of the junior reps noted that "this is America" and we have to becertain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujugareiterated this, saying that "people who abuse smaller people can goto Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equatingconviction with a restraining order."  (Point and match, Senator.)Another pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn't know hiscitizenship "expired every 5 years," and that a driver's license was aprivilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.A third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justicesystem, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and publichangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a deathpenalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored publichangings.  The speaker then responded, "I'll make you a deal.  You getme the rope, and I'll tie the noose."Next came public testimony on the Simon's Rock bill.  A teachertestified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that "hewouldn't have been able to shoot people inside a building while he wasoutside" without his evil gun.  She said that the "loophole" should beclosed to prevent something like this from "ever happening again".Four or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one ofspilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actuallyshot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on,saying, "As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us aresafe -- support gun control."  The committee was reluctant to grill orcorrect the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who hadclaimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  "Only residents can getFID's," he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had noidea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cutout-of-staters completely off?)Yacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill aswritten would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed byout-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT couldbe put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundarysomewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacinounderscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a residentstudent -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mentalrecord.One junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buya gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was "elitist".  Another(Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residentsfrom buying without an FID because only two other states in the unionhad "FID-type" cards, so complying with all the laws of one's homestate was "not enough."  One pro-gun speaker replied that thisresembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming,"Everyone's out of step but Johnny!"All the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimonyfor this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when theother bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (andGOAL's position) were:o  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull    licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)o  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)o  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly   opposed)o  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws    (opposed)o  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)o  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)o  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)o  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)o  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)Some of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remainingpro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.Mike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a triggerlock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licenseeto carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.Caron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it.Again, he brought up the state's archaic records capability and said,"This would create hundreds of different licensing systems."The session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, itcould not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.

Over the last fewyears I have heard of one case after another of government runningcompletely amok.  Unfortunately, most people are oblivious of thegovernment's crimes and still think of it as their protector.  So Iintend to put together what I call the "American Horror File": acompilation of cases where the American government has run roughshodover the rights of its citizens over the last few years, focusingespecially on deaths and injuries resulting from no-knock warrants,and financial ruin to innocents resulting from civil forfeiture laws,but including any other cases for which I can find decentdocumentation.  I hope to make people blood-boiling, artery-bursting,red-hot enraged at their government.The end result will probably be a book in electronic form (ASCII textand postscript files) detailing the government's crimes of recentyears.  This book will be distributed at cost, and I will encouragepeople to post copies to BBS's, send copies on disk to friends, andprint out copies and give them to neighbors.This is a call for your help.  Any information that you can send me onhow government is running amok will be greatly appreciated.  I would preferinformation that is well-documented, with sources given, about specificinstances of governmental abuses.  I also welcome anyone who wants tojoin me in collecting and researching information for this project.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Kevin S.

Neglecting that the government and media have bullshitted thepeople almost nonstop on this issue, Constitutional limitations arethere to prevent a 'tyrrany of the majority'.  For example, a majoritycould vote that given ethnics have no rights, are not people, etc.and it would fly using the logic above.When government feels the Constitution is not right for the times,there is a procedure called an AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION.  THisis deliberately difficult, and cumbersome, to prevent abuse of thosewho decide to ignore the people, or impose unjust policies of amajority on a minority.   A lynch mob is a majority, remember, outvotingthe hangee.What the government is doing are VIOLATIONS, end-runs around thelimitations on the government, probably because they know that thepeople would be very hard to convince that a good intention is behindtampering with the Bill of Rights.  Government propeganda on guns hasbeen very strong and persistant, but not THAT strong.  And it justshows how gullible the people have become to "I am from the governmentand am here to help you sort of line".

 20On a Los Angeles radio station last weekend, the lawyers for thefamily of the MURDERED rancher said that the Los Angeles Sheriff'sDepartment had an assessment done of the rancher's property beforethe raid.This strongly implies that the sheriff's department wanted the property;any drugs (which were not found) were only an excuse.In Viet Nam, Lt Calley was tried and convicted of murder because histroops, in a war setting, deliberately killed innocent people. It is timethat the domestic law enforcement agencies in this country adhere tostandards at least as moral as the military's.Greed killed the rancher, possibly greed killed the Davidian children.Government greed.It is time to prosecute the leaders who perform these invasions.Fred Franceschi   (These are my own opinions!)

Failing to do so within24 hours means they will not cover the hospitalization. In you needyour card to notify them (and without the card, the hospital certainlywouldn't know they had to.)

If gun control doesn'tlower crime overall, then is doesn't address the issue.>...Even a simpleton knows that>he stands a better chance of surviving an attack with a baseball bat...Does that matter if assaults with a baseball bat become muchmore common? Muggers using a gun rely primarily on thethreat of the gun, and rarely shoot their victim. A muggerusing a knife is much more likely to start by stabbing his victim in an effort incapacitate him. So, while a knif may notbe as deadly as a gun, criminals are more likely to actually_use_ the knife (as opposed to threatening the victim with it.)It isn't at all clear that replacing the criminal's gun with aknife would reduce murders. Stabbings might just become morecommon. That's why it is important to look at the overall(not the with-gun) homicide rate. It avoids the issue ofsubstitution, different criminal techinques of using differentweapons, etc... and measures what we want to prevent: Murders.>As for knives, see my earlier post.  I'd much rather face a knife>than a gun, thanks.  "Face"? Possibly. However, facing knife-welding attackers isn'ttoo common: Stabbing without warning and by supprise is theusual tactic.

Anyone trained in unarmed self-defense won't have>much of a problem disarming a knife assailant untrained in knife>assault (which probably means 99.9% of knife assailants).Actually, the exact same statement is true of guns: Training inunarmed self-defence will let you disarm an untrained gunman without much problem.You also ignore the criminal's reaction: The National CrimeSurvey clearly shows that criminals (unarmed, armed with aknife, gun or whatever) are unwilling to risk their livesin a confrontation. If faced with a serious threat, almostall prefer to leave and find an easier target. Therefore,using (or threatening to use, as is much more commonly the case)a weapon _is_ the best defence against an attacker, regardlessof how he is armed. Knives, however, are much less effectivethan guns: Criminals don't consider knifes as a "serious threat"nearly as often as they do guns.

The usual practice would be for the governmentto confiscate the children and put them into the "system".  After theyare deprogrammed of course.The government is capable of incredible evils in the name of"Child protection".  Much of the time "Child protection" concernsitself with protecting the child from its natural parents.  Once itsin the "system", the government's concern for the child tends to go to zero. It may not be as bad as Roman behavior, but it could hardlybe described as "kindly"....unless your a believer in the intrinsicgoodness of the government.

The University cops here (who are>are state cops) are armed better than the Chicago police.  It seems most>state cops are.Define "armed better". Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like theColt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from whichfaster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the otherguys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompsonin hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it's M-16 now to3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troopslike to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (somethingoften in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).A revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.- A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull  the trigger again.- A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,  but will fire merely by pulling the trigger.- A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again  to rotate to the next round.- A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the  hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an  easy motion, even one handed.- Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines  on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.- A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell  first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often  lost as you realize "hey, it's jammed!" before starting to do anything  about clearing it.- Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round  and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the   chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider  this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed  of employment as a revolver.- There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of  operation of many of them requires more training.Some police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietlyswitching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were havingaccidents, partly due to the poor training they received. Not that Glocksrequire rocket scientists, but some cops are baffled by something as complexas the timer on a VCR.Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgunthe police don't know nothing about firearms. Turn off COPS and Hunterand pay attention. I do not seek here to say "semi-autos are junk"merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. A copwith a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more thanequipped for anything short of a riot.Gun control is hitting what you aim at. If you whip out a wonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don't hit anything.Good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit.I own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weaponto something like the Ruger Security Six revolver. If I haven't hitwhat I'm aiming at in the first 5 shots, something is quite seriouslywrong somewheres. While I might like having the backup capacity of thoseextra shots in certain cases, overwhelmingly the # of shots fired incriminal encounters is less than 5.What do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime? Why the same nice simple.38 revolvers that the police often use. Well actually some police prefer the much heftier .357 Magnum, but anyway.....ObPlea: Don't flame me, I prefer semi-autos for most things. But they         introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve-wracking        as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal.-- "If everything had gone as planned, everything would have been perfect."-BATF spokesperson on CNN 3/2/93, regarding failed raid attempt in TX.

 87Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the_Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate televisionstation, KTVB Channel 7.Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 4.Friday, April 16, 1993 was the fourth day of the trial.Synopsis: Defense attorney Gerry Spence cross-examined agentCooper under repeated objections from prosecutor RonaldHowen.  Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.The day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of DeputyMarshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  AlthoughSpence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategymust involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper isthe government's only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan.Spence attacked Cooper's credibility by pointing out discrepanciesbetween Cooper's statements last September and those made in court.Cooper conceded that, "You have all these things compressed intoa few seconds...It's difficult to remember what went on first."Cooper acknowledged that he carried a "9mm Colt Commando submachinegun with a silenced barrel." [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!]Cooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specificplans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver's dog.When Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan'sM-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say forsure that Degan did not return fire before going down.Spence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent)had Cooper discussed last August's events, Cooper responded, "Ifyou're implying that we got our story together, you're wrong,counselor."  Spence continued to advance the defense's version ofthe events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting bykilling the Weaver's dog.  Cooper disagreed.Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence'svirulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questionswere repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained that Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance thedefense's version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodgesustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisteduntil Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded toadmonish both attorneys.  "I'm not going to play games with eithercounsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so startacting like professionals."Spence told the judge that, "When all the evidence is in, we'll seethat ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, thathe was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events." Spence continued, "We're going to find...that there is a very unlikelysimilarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - betweenthe testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses."Spence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen's repeatedobjections would prevent a fair trial, "We can't have a fair trial if thejury believes I'm some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I'mbending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I'mviolating court orders."Judge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen'sobjections had somehow prejudiced the jury was "preposterous" anddenied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restricthis comments when objecting.The trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent GregRampton.  The prosecution's purpose was simply to introduce fiveweapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seizedon the opportunity to further address Cooper's credibility.Defense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris' other attorney) questionedRampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specificplans to kill the Weaver's dog without being detected.  Matthews thenhad Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Ramptonhad said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weaponwas to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them.Rampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that,but he could not remember when.  He then stated that, "I did not conductthe primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversationswith him since the interview was conducted."Monday, April 19, 1993 will begin the fifth day of the trial.  Scheduledis the continued cross-examination of FBI agent Greg Rampton.

 7In the videos of the original BATF attack on the BD church, did anyonehappen to see BATF agents on the highest structure, where Koresh'sroom was? I don't recall seeing BATF agents higher than the roof of thelowest structures, so I made an assumption that BATF helos did thefiring down into the tower. Any other info on how the rounds camethrough the roof?

Either you don't read very well or resortto falsehoods in an attempt to make a point.At the risk of boring and belaboring the point, my claim wasthe chain was regarding the tanks "last used in Detroit in 48".The text follows.:  You did not merely claim that: tanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress: sniper fire and that they were "quite" effective at this.  Indeed, when Coffman claimed they were only used as APCs, I did sayI had been told they did fire their main guns.    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^: You continue to: back away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is: disputing.Well, the poster who I responded to did dispute the use of tankspost-48.  Rude of you to call Gary Coffman a nobody.  : "Well, it's not the main gun."  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are you: now going to admit that you were wrong?That was the entire point to *you*.  What exactly did I claim?   --------------------------------------------------  "I've heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main gunsto respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively."   --------------------------------------------------  I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you'repaying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my owneyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helpspeople judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,"bullshit filters".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.  What was it I claimed as fact?  Here's the entire post:  -------------------------------------------------->We haven't used tanks against the black ghettos since Detroit 1948. Correction.  I know they used tanks in Detroit 1968.  I saw em, itwas well covered in the news at that time.  Gordon Lightfoot mentionsit in his song "Black Day in July".  --------------------------------------------------  Since you don't dispute that and claim that nobody else does, thatmeans I was right.  : I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67: riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place: without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American: military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have: been *big* news.   So one would suppose.  Some folks think in happened in 48.  Awesley goes on:  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.: To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion: grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be: perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since: it makes your other claim seem more plausible.John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so youhave to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read saidnothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If youneed some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for awhile.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here. : If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been: screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about: it.    Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some anauthority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if ithad happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such anauthority, you probably know that people did scream about an allegedmassive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 butthe Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was "several".  I've alsoheard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'dassert that I claimed they were truth.: Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up.    Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26 years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.So it would have been an Army cover-up.   Another part of my memories was that while most damaged buildingwere burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was andam inclined to believe an old sarge or two.: If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer: to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that: those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.   Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believethat they did fire their guns.   Now then, we've bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to readthis far and all you've managed to say is that you don't believe theaccount I cited.: --John L.

This seems a strange argument to make considering that Canada'sviolent crime rate in general is far lower than that of the U.S.  (Ournon-gun crime rate is greater than their *entire* crime rate).  Itwould seem strange to suggest that it, to, were the result of guncontrol laws.       I think if we looked we'd find very specific (cultural andenforcement) reasons why the non-gun rate is low as well, and thenthat reasons could be applied to the with-gun rates as easily.>Given that most>criminally used guns are either legally purchased or stolen from those who>purchase them legally, having more restrictions on legal possession does >seem to have the effect of reducing gun-related crimes.

I've still not been convinced that guns, a commodity which criminalshave shown their perfectly willing to pay for from illegal sources(stolen either from police, military, or civilian) we wouldn't simplysee South American sources from which drugs come start smuggling guns aswell, since there's a thriving gun manufacturing industry down there.>>If you would just look a little closer at the crime statistics, you would>>realize that:>>  -our non-gun crime rate is also very high, so guns per se are not the issue>>Directly contradicted by the NEJM study that compared crime in Seattle and>Vancouver, B.C.

And as was not pointed out in the study, but in critiquesof it, (two seperate articles by James Wright and David Kopel cometo mind) it was pointed out that the difference was *also* almostentirely minority related.  That is, the gun crime rate skyrocketedfor poor minorities (Blacks and Hispanics primarily) while when youcompared the white majority they were virutally identical.        The problem with the NEJM study was they compared minority vs.non-minority percentages but failed to take into account the relativeconditions of those minorities.  That there was an eqaul percentage ofnomn-whites was about as far as they went.  They failed to take intoaccount that the non-whites in either city were not living in thesame conditions.        If the situation was entirely based on availability of guns,then we'd expect that the white rates, the two groups which arearguably fairly comparative in the two cities, would have a farhigher rate in Seattle.  Yet the majority in Seattle is not onlynot significantly higher when the minorities are excluded, but slightlylower.>>  -violent crime is highly concentrated in the inner city>>Surprise.

The point is, of course, that many of the U.S. "inner-city"problems are not mirrored in Canada.  As such  if there is a conditionwhich is significantly different in Canada from the U.S., and violentcrime is highly correlated to that area, suggesting that gun controlis the source of Canada's low rate is highly questionable.  (As oneCanadian pointed out on talk.politics.guns, Canada's major gun controlin 1978 did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increasein violent crime rates, which have been rising steadily since.  Apparentlythey didn't even mirror the U.S.s very large drop of violent crime inthe early eighties.>>  -most violent crime occurs in areas with strict gun control already>>Post hoc ergo propter hoc.

Take Washington D.C., wheregun control was instituted while it had crime problems true, but thatcrime proceeded to explode afterwards.  Similarly for New York.       The question is not simply a point in time where crime was highor low.  Did the gun control significantly and positively impactviolent crime.  Since it's gone up in those areas, often faster than itwas going up before, you can't simply dismiss the high crime rate bysaying gun control was caused by it.  Yes, gun control may be institutedto deal with high crime.  But if the crime is not positively impacted, youcan't continually say that that crime rate was entirely a cause ofthat gun control, since much of that crime rate increased after gun controlwas implemented, just as happened in Canada.>Similar or worse rates exist in cities with poor gun control.

If people decide to own guns*and* live in one place together then that is their prerogative.  Onthe other hand, if the BDs were in posession of explosives and illegalguns then the government did have the right to search their compound.But, the allegations that the BDs were in posession of illegal weaponshasn't been proven yet, so I'm not going to conclude that the BDs brokeany laws.  David Koresh was accused of abusing children, but if thisis his *only* crime then the presence of the ATF can't be justified.The ATF is only supposed to deal with firearms, tobacco, and alcoholviolations.  ATF agents are basically cigarette cops...they shouldstay out of other kinds of law-enforcement actions that are out oftheir jurisdiction.

Human life---children and adultsalike---should be treated with respect---even if they are "heavily-armedreligious wackos".David Koresh's lawyer seemed to think that everyone *would* come outpeacefully sooner or later.  The FBI and ATF had NOTHING BUT TIME ONTHEIR HANDS!  Why did they have to escalate the situation and causethis senseless tragedy?  Their job is to protect the public and SAVELIVES NOT KILL PEOPLE for crying out loud.> It really was a no win situation.

I read in a newspaper today that one of thecult members said that when one of the tanks went through the wall thatit knocked over a lantern which caused the ranch house to be caught onfire.  This cult member also said that David Koresh had *no* intentionsof committing mass suicide.  David Koresh's lawyer also confirms this.Therefore, if this is true then this means that the FBI AND ATF MURDEREDEVERYONE IN THAT HOUSE!  Even if this is not true, the FBI and ATF stilldon't get off the hook because they waited a damn long time to call theWaco fire department.

The original post claimed that the ATF/FBI was pumping napalm into the building with the hopes that the wood stove inside would ignite it.  I responedwith why would the wood stove be lit in the first place?  It wouldn't be lit for heating purposes because of the weather in Texas.  Everyone now claims that it was for cooking.  Stop and think about this.  CS gas was being pumpedinto the building and I presume that everyone was wearing gas masks (eitherbought or some type of makeshift type) and this had been going on for 6 hours.I don't know if you have ever been around CS, but I have.  Being exposed to CSgas was part of my Army training, so I know that without a mask it VERY uncomfortable and makes your eyes water, nose run, and makes you sick in the stomach.  And with the mask it is very difficult to drink water much less eat.  So my question now is "why were they cooking food?"   I will buy that a lantern could have been knocked over and caused the fire.But that stove was not being used for cooking (unless they were even morecrazy than the ATF/FBI claim).Michael

What exactly did I claim?     --------------------------------------------------    "I've heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns  to respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively."     --------------------------------------------------      I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're  paying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own  eyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps  people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,  "bullshit filters".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.  Later in the same post:     Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building  were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and  am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.Fine, *now* you are stating that you believe their claims (or that you are"inclined" to.  See below for a stronger statement of your beliefs).  Thoseclaims are still ludicrous, however.Previously Awesley had written:  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.Prompting me to write:  To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion  grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be  perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since  it makes your other claim seem more plausible.To which Awesley replied:  John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you  have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said  nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you  need some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a  while.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here.But why did you mention grenade launchers at all?  Because it supports thenotion that the tanks shelled buildings.  And it supports that notionbecause it conjures images of troops launching fragmentary grenades.  Butthat too is ludicrous.I wrote:  If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been  screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about  it. Awesley relied:     Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an  authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it  had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an  authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged  massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.  Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but  the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was "several".  I've also  heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd  assert that I claimed they were truth.Yes, if it happened I would have heard about it.  Everybody would have. Army tanks don't fire their cannons in American cities in the 1960'swithout it becoming common knowledge, without minority leaders seizing onit and condemning it over and over again, without civil libertarians saying"this has gone far enough."  So, yes, my never hearing of it was the basisfor my disbelieving the claim.  Now I have more reasons to disbelieve it. Not one poster has written to say, yes, I lived in Detroit at that time andeverybody knew that the tanks had fired shells.  This is the UseNet.  If ithad happened, somebody here would remember it.  Furthermore, your ownresearch failed to come up with any support for the claim.  The claim isextraordinary and it has no supporting evidence, extraordinary or not. Unless you count the brags of a couple of guardsmen shooting the shit.  Ido not.I wrote:  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. Awesley wrote:     Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the   difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26   years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.  So it would have been an Army cover-up.Quibble.  Fine, it was an Army cover-up.  Six years in the Reserves hastaught me the difference also.  But do you think that in two and halfdecades not one guilt-ridden participant has come forward and said "yes, Ishelled Americans," or "I gave the orders to fire the cannons," or "Ihelped cover it up"?I wrote:  If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  Iprefer  to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that  those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.Awesley replied:    Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believe  that they did fire their guns.Good.  Then we can drop the junk about you not claiming that they did. Your belief fails a basic reality check: why isn't it known?Awesley concludes:     Now then, we've bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read  this far and all you've managed to say is that you don't believe the  account I cited.Actually, now we have established that I don't believe what you believe, aswell as why I don't believe it.  And if it's boring, then I yield the lastword to you, if you want it.  You may say anything you like withimpunity--I am dropping the subject.--John L. Scott

You'll accept expediency and a coward's safety over any beliefjust as long as the government tells you to.  You assume that anyone whodoesn't comform to your beliefs and ways of thinking are wrong andtherefore bad.  Worse, you seem to accept without question what thegovernment says is wrong to be wrong.David Koresh's religion was not mine but then again, neither are the baptists,methodists, catholics or any of the rest of the corporate religions.  BUTeven though Koresh's, the Baptists, the methodists, etc, don't believethe same way I do, I recognize that their religions are equally validto mine and more importantly are equally protected under the 1st Amendment.You see, I'm not that much different than Koresh and I suspect many othersfit the same catagory.  I read the Bible many times and as I learned from it, I discovered that a lot of what corporate religions practicejust isn't justified by MY interpretation of the Bible.  Therefore I gomy own way.  So did Koresh.  And neither you nor I nor anyone else,either individually or collectively as the great socialist "we" has ANY RIGHT WHATSOEVER to tell me or you or Koresh that our religions are wrong.You seem to think that it would have been oh so easy for the Davidians tojust forsake everything they believed in and walk out of their compoundin order to "save themselves".  Think (if you're capable) for a momentabout some belief you hold dearest.  Would you abandon that belief ifsuddenly told to do so by the government?  If you would do so you arebeneath contempt.  Let's assume you have a belief that you hold dearenough to commit your life to.  Do you think it would be the correctcourse of action for your government to initiate actions specificallydesigned to force you to make that "forsake or die" decision?The "forsake or die" option is exactly what the government forced on theDavidians the day the first wave of black-clad stormtroopers fired thatfirst shot and tossed that first grenade.  The FBI clenched it on Day 51when they sent in heavy armor against 80-some-odd men, women andchildren holed up in a rickety old building and armed with small arms.  Thepeople who stayed, who held to their beliefs over personal safety, whoseindividual personal honors demanded they die rather than submit, whobelieved that the Bill of Rights meant exactly what it says, to thosepeople go my deepest respect, regardless of their religion.  People likeyou who blithely blow off the murder of 80 people with "well they couldhave come out" get my most scornful contempt.  I'd spit in your facewere there not a network between us.

There was at least one blast consistent with petroleum products that Isaw, however propane is interesting stuff.  It doesn't explode on contact withair.

 106NO SURRENDER!Delivered by Lenda Jackson at the RKBA Rally in Denver, April 18, 1993It is a fact of modern life that urban residents, particularly women, feelthreatened. A certain number of them actually are threatened. There areimmediate threats, the things that women will tell you they're afraidof. The noise downstairs at night. The lonely walk to the car. Thestranger at the door. The abusive husband, finally kicked out of thehouse as he threatens to hurt her and their children. The burglar... Themugger...the rapist. And what are we told is the solution? Move. Get a dog. Keep the doorlocked. Call the police. as a next-to-last resort, learn martial arts. andalways, there's the implied question "what's a pretty little thing likeyou doing without a husband around to protect you?But what if you don't like dogs? Like living alone? Don't have 10years to devote learning judo?What if, after examining the facts, a woman learns that "rape victimsusing armed resistance were less likely to have the rape completed -and were less likely to be injured(Kleck,124) than those using anyother form of resistance (Kleck,126) (also true forrobbery/assault)(Kleck,123) What if, to our horror and despair, we find that citizens cannot dependon the police for effective protection - they usually respond after acrime has been committed. In truth, the Supreme Court has held thatthe police are not responsible for protecting any individual, only thewhole community.As a society, are we going to ask women, once again, to sacrificethemselves? Are we going to continue to deny women the ability tohelp themselves?Here's a thought. Neil Smith, in his book The Probability Broach, says"no 220 pound thug can threaten the well being or dignity of a 110-pound woman who has two pounds of iron to even things out." But ifa woman decides to protect herself, with the easiest, most efficientmeans possible, people - especially other women - are horrified."Eughh, how could you? I'd be terrified!" they ask. How could youhurt someone? They'll repeat the lie: it'll just get taken away fromyou. In truth, 1% of "defensive gun uses" result in the offender takingthe gun away from the victim.(122,Kleck)Well, despite the lies, and the social pressure, some of us have alreadymade that hard choice. We've decided that we are not going to bevictimized by the muggers, burglars or rapists. We're buying moreguns than every before. We're learning how to use them - and teachingothers, women and men, how to use them. Most importantly, we arepreparing ourselves mentally to use our firearms for our own defense.We're taking our own security, literally, into our own hands. We'regoing to stop begging and pleading and marching and WHAT WEINTEND IS TO REALLY TAKE BACK THE NIGHT.But there's another threat, more insatiable than any mugger, moresecretive than any burglar, more soul-destroying than any rapist.That menace is government, and it threatens us all. We know thatgovernments, throughout time, have suppressed rights and oppressedpeople. It's the way they survive.In our names and with our money, it interferes with innocent peopleboth at home and abroad. It lies to us, cheats us, steals from us andthreatens us with violence. No one knows exactly what it'll do next -what freedom we will lose because some government goon decides"it's for your own safety" or "we know best". Any person who actedlike government does would be psychoanalyzed within an inch of hislife and locked up as a habitual offender.But this monster called government persists, and grows. And we, whoshould be its masters, have become its unwilling slaves. Do you doubtme? Then why did you file your income tax? Like any reasonable person, I believe that being afraid of somethingthat can hurt you is smart, and that paranoia isn't crazy if someone'sreally after you. And make no mistake, they're after you and they'reafter me. Their names are familiar: Brady and Reynolds, Groff,Metzenbahm, Moynihan, and Clinton. If we're lucky, they'll settle forour assault rifles, our shotguns, our handguns and our ammunition. As citizens, we have only two choices. They are the same two choicesgiven to women: to surrender or to fight. Surrender leads to the gulag, to the genocide of Pol Pot, to thedisappearances, to Dachau. I do not intend to surrender. A battle can be philosophical or political: in the main, the people keepthe government honest by threatening to vote it out of office. But ifthey have to, they will keep in mind the words of Thomas Jefferson:"the tree of liberty must be well watered with the blood of patriots."As a patriot, I will point out the error in the government's ways. I willdo my best to vote the villains out of office. I will protest, and write,and speak, and teach our children justice, honor and truth. And alwaysremember that Rebellion can lead to Bunker Hill and Saratoga......or itcan lead to Tiananmen Square. When the time comes to stand up, if I have to give my life to keepthem from going too far, if there is a Tiananmen Square in our future,I intend to be there. And no matter what lies they tell and no matterwhat laws they pass, I intend to meet them with something moresubstantial in my hand than a brick. My opinions are, of course, my own.

The availability of them in the USA makes them the preferred  : murder weapon, but ban them, and some other weapon will step in as the  : favorite.As a "favorite", sure.  As lethal, not likely.  A study of violence inChicago produced this table:Percentage of Reported Gun and Knife Attacks    Resulting in Death    WeaponDeaths As Percentage of Attacks---------------------------------------------------------------Knives (16,518 total attacks) 2.4Guns (6,350 total attacks)12.2Source: Firearms and Violence in American LifeIt might be contended that if gun murderers were deprived of gunsthat they would find a way to kill as often with knives.  If this wereso, knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicidewould be expected to show a low fatality rate, and knife attacks incities where guns were not so widely used (like Vancouver) would showa higher fatality rate.  But the Nat'l Commission on the Causes andPrevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found thisnot to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knifeattacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks(which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants),the proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to theproportion of gun attacks.  In fact, the reverse was true.What was found was that most homicides did not show a determination onthe part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tendedto show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do gravephysical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about thehead neck and chest, etc.  Most gun homicides did not show thispattern.  Rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment ofrage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.Source: Report on Firearms and Violence: Then, since England != USA (my ancestors left because of the oppression) you  : must compare England before strict gun laws to England after strict gun laws to  : be able to draw any meaning at all.  England has essentially legalized drugs,  : so there are no drug gangs battling for turf, etc., there.  If you drop out the  : drug related killings here, the USA would look a whole lot more peaceful.There are a lot of factors which make a difference.  Actually, I'm notfond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans andAmericans. There are more cultural, beahvioral and economicdifferences between us than similarities.  I just sort of foundmyself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  Idon't think we could ever attain the low levels of European violentcrime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required everylaw-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi.On the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are moreculturally similar, namely the Canadians.  In fact, an exhaustive,seven-year study has already been done of the respective crime ratesof Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... citieswith roughly the same population, urban economy, geographyand crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.In Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  Aftera 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealedweapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.In Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reasonto purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted.Recreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) areregulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires arestricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained inorder to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handgunstransported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box.In short, gun control but not unreasonably so.Both cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions forgun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchersstudied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated),burglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from1/1/80 to 12/31/86. In defining the cases, they used the samestandard: the FBI's Unified Crime Report.Results: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery inSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver(1.09 / 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99).18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 inVancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault inSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 /1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher(1.16 / 1.12).  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided byweapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged.Although both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravatedassault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms werefar more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact, 7.7 times as often.Over the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle(11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000).After adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations,the relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, ascompared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63.When homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rateof homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) inSeattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver.Virtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due toa more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handgunsaccounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handgunswere 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle thanin Vancouver.The authors of the report also investigated "legally justifiable"homicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred duringthe seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 inSeattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  Afterexcluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on theseearlier findings.-------This is, I feel, a very fair report.  One might even make theargument that it is biased against Canada as a whole becauseVancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three timesthat of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reportsannual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC,Chicago, Los Angeles and Houston.Critics of handgun control always argue that limited legal accessto handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide becausepersons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire agun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently.If the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more bythe strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, wecould expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns tobe higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However, during the studyinterval, Vancouver's rate of homicide by weapons other than gunswas not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting thatfew would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.As well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abidingcitizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle didexperience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, thesecases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both citiesduring the course of the study period.  And, as was reported,Seattle apparently didn't enjoy relief from any crime categoryover Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves forself-defense.Heavily quoted source: Handgun Regulation, Crime,Assaults, and Homicide: A Tale of Two Cities.John H.

 82  UPI Washington DC, Update Desk4/15/93  For the past several months the Clinton administration has been  stymied by mixed signals coming from the economy.  While most  leading indicators has shown an apparent improvement in the   economy, there has been no corresponding improvement in the area  of jobs creation.  The unemployment figures seem stalled at the 7% mark.  last month,  in an effort to understand this problem, President Clinton appointed  a blue ribbon panel to try to resolve the apparent conflicting  economic signals.  This panel was chaired by Vice President Gore.  Today the panel released their results, providing a shocking conclusion.  "It's the guns" Vice President Gore said.  Apparently NRA members, and other  "gun-nuts" are purchasing firearms at in record numbers, pulling the  economy out of the recession.  "Their buying them five times faster than  ever before, and stockpiling left and right", the Vice President said.    However, since many domestic firearm and ammunition manufacturers have  been experiencing hard times during the past few years, including several  declarations of bankruptcy by many leading American gun makers, they have  not rushed to increase hiring to meet the new demand.  "We want to see if this run will continue before hiring more people", said  the President of Colt industries.  "As long as Clinton is in office, we  suspect it will", he added.  In response to this new information, President Clinton announced a new  Gun Control measure to be introduced into Congress this session.  It's   called the "Ban-One-A-Month" Gun Control Bill.  Under the terms of this law,  every make and model of all firearms will be written on individual index   cards.  The cards will all be put in a big hat and the President will draw  one card every month.  Sixty days later that gun will be banned from any  further manufacture/importation or sale in this country, except to the  politically connected and to members of the National Police Force.  The President said, "This law will benefit America two ways.  When the  Gun-Of-The-Month is announced every thirty days, the gun-nuts will run  out and buy thousands of them, boosting the economy even more.  In addition,  over the long run, we will get all of these icky-evil guns off of the  street."  He also announce the appointment of Sarah Brady to oversee  this program, citing her "Honesty, and unbiased view on the subject  of gun control".  Senators Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Feinstein, and Boxer have proposed an  amendment to the Bill which would add additional index cards containing  caliber designations for all know ammunitions.  "Their stockpiling,  stockpiling, stockpiling" screamed Metzenbaum during a press conference  at the national Headquarters of Handgun Control Inc.  Senators Simon, Metzenbaum, and Moyenhan also introduced an amendment  that would make all guns illegal to possess once the last card has been  drawn from the hat.  Senator Simon was quoted as saying, "First we'll  fuck em, then we'll kick em out of bed in the morning", during a press  conference he held in the second floor Mens Restroom of the Senate  building.  He of course was referring to the fact that he would allow  the people to purchase the guns to help the economy, but would require  the BATF to seize all of the guns in America sometime in the year 2008,  after all of the cards have been drawn.  The head of the BATF responded by saying, "We will have to see if this  thing in Waco is over by then.  We may be too busy to seize all those  guns".  US House Representatives Pat Schroeder and David Skaggs of Colorado  declared this proposed law as being "reasonable gun control which won't  affect anybodys Constitutional right to own sporting guns".  - end article -  For the humor impaired :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)                                 Bill Vojak                                vojak@icebucket.stortek.comNRA, ILA,                                Colorado Firearms Coalition------------------------------------------------------------The CBS Nightly Propaganda With Dan Rather.

 30I have been convinced of the right of AMericans to an effective self-defense, but something strikes me as odd among thepro-RKBA arguments presented here.The numbers comparing hundreds of thousands (indeed, even amillion) of instances of law abiding citizens deterringcriminal activity, seem valid to me.  Likewise the numberof gun-caused homicides each year (about 11,000/year?).  However,it is surprising that the "Evil AntiGun Empire " (Darth Vaderbreathing sound effect here) never tries to compare"All legitimate gun defenses" vs. "All gun crimes."  Instead, it's always "All legitimate gun defenses,"  which includescases in which the criminals are shot but not killed, andcases in which the criminal is not here, vs. just criminal gun homicides, which only includes case sin whichthe victim died.Why is this?  Of course, it wouldn't be unreasonable to saythat in each crime already measured (involving guns), theconsequnces are already known and it is safe to assume thata gun-based bank robbery last week will not suddenly turninto a gun-basd robbery+homicide.  Whereas in the legitimategun defenses, one may assume that all those criminals whowere deterred would have committed more crime or moreserious crimes had they not been deterred.-Case Kimkim39@husc.harvard.edu

IsTexas one of those states?Can anyone point me to a source for info on how many people have been killed by legal full-auto weapons in the U.S.?And finally, I think it would be great if anyone was keeping a digestof facts on the Waco incident.

 85Message-ID: <1ra7f7INNc74@dns1.NMSU.Edu>NNTP-Posting-Host: kazak.nmsu.eduX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL9]The Colorado Daily recently reprinted the Wall Street Journal's articleon Paxton Quigley, including the nefarious little paragraph the Journaltacked onto the end.  After recieving much assistance from various T.P.G.type folks, I wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph,and surprise, surprise, surprise, they published it.  The text follows.The Colorado Daily, btw, is the University of Colorado (Boulder) student(I think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup, but every little bit, i guess...(The title was the only thing they changed/added)"Gun Stats"The Daily recently reprinted an article from theWall Street Journal, primarily concerned with PaxtonQuigley, author of "Armed and Female."  The article,in turn, cites a misleading statistic that was originallyreported in the New England Journal of Medicine.  Thearticle states, "A study... found that a gun in the homewas 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner,spouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder."  Thisis an often-quoted statistic, and it is misleading for sev-eral reasons, outlined below:The study gives the impression that, if you own a gun, the likelihood that you will successfully use it to defend yourself is less than that of the gun being turnedagainst you.  The study, however, fails to take intoaccount cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gun to thwart a crime, without actually killing the perpe-trator.The study actually refers to 'acquaintances' ratherthan 'friend'.  This would include the friendly neigh-borhood thug who shows up like clockwork, everymonth, the second your grandmother cashes her socialsecurity check.  Possibly an acquaintance, but hardly afriend.The NEJM study is based on the immediate dis-position of cases and fails to take into account casesoriginally filed as homicides that were later ruled to beself-defense.  Especially considering the small sample size (396), taking these events into account has a sub-stantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted.Criminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif-erent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to be used, successfully, by a private citizen against an aggressor than it is to kill anyone at all.  Further, per-sons defending themselves from aggression by using a gun fare better than those who resist vicimization bysome other means, or who offer no resistance at all.Statistics available from the FBI and other agencies also show that a gun is 245 times more likely to beused by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threatthan to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 timesmore likely to be used to defend against a criminalthreat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 timesmore likely to defend against criminal threat than to beused to commit suicide.It is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can be proved by uncritical quotation of statistics.  One hasto consider carefully what questions were asked bythose gathering the data before one can draw an accu-rate conclusion from them.D.F.

Minor quibble:  The assualt (and it was one) began near dawn.  The fire didnot break out for several hours.  I find it highly unlikely that the BD wouldbe cooking lunch while armored vehicles punch holes in their house and arepumping in tear gas.  The lantern story makes more sense, except the fire seemed to spread too quickly, even given the nature of the buildings and thevery high winds.  And it was daylight, but I guess in the innner recesses itcould be dark--shutters probably closed as well.  Which puts us back to the FBI did it, or the BD did it, or some other screw-up occured, which is quite possible.  The problem with the FBI as a monolithic entity doing it is that it requires*everybody* involved to keep their mouths shut.  While they tended to behave like total idiots, that does not make them homocidal maniacs, either.  And ifit was one nutcase agent, then it serves no purpose to blame the whole agency.  I can believe that a real nut-case like a Koresh would start such a fire,but I'm far from convinced he actually did so.

But if you insist, according to the 1990 UCR, "Firearm murdersof youngsters 19 and under increased 125 percent between 1984 and 1990" Is the National Center for Health Statistics good enough for you?  They statethat "Every day, 12 American children ages 19 and under are killed in gunaccidents, suicides, and homicides.  Many more are wounded". Or how about the National Pediatric Trauma Registry?  They say "Gunshotwounds to children ages 16 and under nearly doubled in major urban areasbetween 1987 and 1990." Do you also doubt the American Academy of Pediatrics Charles???  They statethat "Gunshot wounds among children in urban areas increased 300% from1986 to 1988." Charles, I hope you don't need to be convinced that youth are increasinglyvictims of gun injuries and that they have easy access to guns.  If you don'trealize this fact, (I don't care if you go by CDC or FBI data, or if you gointo the homes, schools, and streets where these kids are and take a pollby yourself), I'm not going to bother to try to convince you.

With regard to this discussion:  We are getting dangerously far from the usualrantings of t.p.g, and close to the realm of r.g, but I'd like to put my twocents worth in.  While there's nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a large frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages tosemi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob's (I know, some people can't standhim and think he's full of bull, but I think that in general his material isvery valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something like that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto's are different, and that"different is good".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also acertain "propriatory nature" of each gun that takes some familiarity to learn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiarwith different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at leastslowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun.|> |> Define "armed better". Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the|> Colt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which|> faster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other|> guys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson|> in hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it's M-16 now to|> 3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops|> like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something|> often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).|> |> A revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.|> |> - A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull|>   the trigger again.|> - A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,|>   but will fire merely by pulling the trigger.Yes, but this is best done with a two hand hold.  With a single hand you eitherpull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semiauto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot.|> - A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again|>   to rotate to the next round.I'm not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DAsemi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the sameround - an advantage you don't have in a revolver where the next trigger pull willalways go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dudbut what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it's very rare, but your round willnow go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slideon a misfire takes very little time.|> - A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the|>   hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an|>   easy motion, even one handed.Actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is notnecessary or usually recommended.  A revolver would have to fall hard enough andat the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into theround to set it off.|> - Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines|>   on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.The best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speedloaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a twohanded job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means thatwhile you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears thegun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always take more time.  You also don't have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacinga partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine canstill be used if needed later).  |> |> - A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell|>   first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often|>   lost as you realize "hey, it's jammed!" before starting to do anything|>   about clearing it.Yes, the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clearit.  Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfirewith factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-autobut even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.).|> - Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round|>   and cock the hammer.

While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I shouldsay that this applies to all of the ones I've looked at.  For the DA semi's it'sno different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firingpin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there's no real advantagecarrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speedof employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I'mnot familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I wasinitially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examiningthe design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), and shooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially ina thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also getsyou more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver.|> |> Some police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly|> switching many officers back to the old revolvers.

I still can't figure out how it's worse than a revolverfor safety.  If you don't pull the trigger it doesn't go off.  I imagine that if allyour revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock triggerfar enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition, if you had developed thatnasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun andrelying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blewoff your foot then you'd have problems when the hammer wasn't there.|> |> Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun|> the police don't know nothing about firearms.

 203Here's something Preston Covey (professor of ethics at CMU) wrote:From: "Preston K. Covey" <covey+@andrew.cmu.edu>Subject: Gun Stats & Mortal RisksDate: Mon, 15 Feb 1993 18:35:05 -0500 (EST)Folks,Hail from the nether world.  On February 4th, the Wall Street Journalcarried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled "Armed Force."  Ifelt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare statthat "A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect."  I sentthe following to the WSJ.-----Gun Stats & Mortal RisksPreston K. CoveyErik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley (~Armed Force,~2/4/93, WSJ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding gunsin the home:  ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in KingCounty, Washington, found that a gun in the home was 43 times morelikely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend or child than tokill an intruder.~  The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days;  ithas grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflatedby one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~  Given the shock value ofthe finding, the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine(NEJM) study is remarkably understated:  ~The advisability of keepingfirearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~  Responsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits ofbringing a firearm into their home.   But what we need to know is this: What exactly are the risks and benefits?  The NEJM testimony is neitherthe whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about therisks.  Further, as with motor vehicles, we want to know:  What controldo we have over the risks and benefits?  And, as with the risks ofcancer or heart disease or auto accidents:  How can we minimize therisks?  Like raw highway death tolls, the NEJM stat is not very helpfulhere. The NEJM finding purports to inform us, but it is framed to warn usoff.  It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat,~ amisleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudiceand terrify.  The frightful statistic screams for itself:  The risks faroutweigh the benefits, yes?   What fool would run these risks?   If yourcar were 43 times more likely to kill you, a loved one, a dear friend oran innocent child than to get you to your destination,  should you nottake the bus?  Uncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad companyof lies and damned lies.   Surely, we can do better where lives are atstake.   Let~s take a closer look at this risky business:The ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing thenumber of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense(the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances  killedby a gun in the home (the dividend).  The divisor of this risk equationis 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 othercases of self-defense.  The dividend is 387:  in the study there were 12accidental deaths, 42 criminal homicides, and 333 suicides.  387 dividedby 9 yields 43.  There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in KingCounty between 1978 and 1983,  so the study leaves 347 deaths outside ofhomes unaccounted.The NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading onsix counts:1.  The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media:  the ~oracquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers andneighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~  The implication isthat the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members,dear friends, and innocent children.  Deaths may all be equally tragic,but the character and circumstance of both victims and killers arerelevant to the risk.  These crucial risk factors are masked by thecalculated impression that the death toll is generated by witlessWaltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors.  This iscriminological hogwash.2.   The study itself does not distinguish households or environspopulated by people with violent, criminal, or substance-abuse histories-- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabitedby more civil folk (for example, people who avoid high-risk activitieslike drug dealing, gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk isvery low indeed.  In actuality, negligent adults allow fatal butavoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people withhistories of violence or abuse, people who are identifiably andcertifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure.  To ignore these obviousrisk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading asignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology, neithergun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms orvehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or drivercrucially affect the risk. 3.  One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed isthat the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to killthan to protect, and this obscures -- indeed, disregards -- the role ofpersonal responsibility.  The typical quotation of this study (unlikeLarson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun:  ~A gun in the home is 43times as likely to kill . . . .~  (The Center to Prevent HandgunViolence, a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic, uses thisparticular formulation.)  We can dispense with the silly debate aboutwhether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing:  again, bytautology, gun  deaths would not occur without the guns.  The questionbegged is how many deaths would occur anyway, without the guns.  In anycase, people are the death-dealing agents, the guns are their lethalinstruments.  The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deathsare personal responsibility and choice.  Due care and responsibilityobviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (bygun or otherwise).  The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person toNEJM~s high-risk pool.  The gun does not create this risk by itself. People have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in theirhomes.  For example, graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protectioncourse do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled andsober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular deathas do reckless or drunk drivers.  Undiscriminating actuarials disregardand obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice, just as theydisregard and obscure the role of socio-economic, criminological andother risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death.  This is why weresent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whosenorms disregard our individualities.  Fortunately, nothing can consignus to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility inthe matter.4.  Suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in theNEJM study.  As against the total deaths by gun in King County,including those outside the home, in-house suicides are 44% of the totaldeath toll, which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by otherstudies.  Suicide is a social problem of a very different order fromhomicide or accidents.  The implication of the NEJM study is that thesesuicides might not occur without readily available guns.  It is truethat attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed.  It is not obviouslytrue that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of thesesuicides.  This is widely assumed or alleged, but the preponderance ofresearch on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise, that this iswishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases.  (See:  BruceL. Danto et al., The Human Side of Homicide,  Columbia University Press,1982;  Charles Rich et al.,  ~Guns and Suicide,~  American Journal ofPsychiatry,  March 1990.)  If suicides were removed from the dividend ofthe NEJM study~s risk equation, the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to~six.~  The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like thecauses, durability, or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is aprofoundly debatable matter.  Quotations of the NEJM study totallydisregard this issue.5.  Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimablerate of justifiable and excusable homicide.  Most measures, like theNEJM homicide rate, are based on the immediate disposition of cases. But many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruledself-defense.  In the literature on battered women, immediate casedispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate ofjustifiable or excusable homicide. Time~s January 18, 1993, cover storyon women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of womenwho appeal have their murder convictions thrown out.  Time~s July 17,1989, cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domesticcases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides werereported as self-defense.  In a May 14, 1990, update, Time  reportedthat 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. InTime~s sample, the originally reported rate of self-defense was in errorby a factor of four.  The possibility of such error is not acknowledgedby promulgators of the NEJM statistic. 6.  While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equationare arguably inflated, the divisor is unconscionably misleading.  Thedivisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed,  notaggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or evenshot at.   The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of thecoin from the harms done with guns in homes.  What kind of moral idiocyis it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ?  Do we measurethe utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- asopposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled, apprehended, ordeterred?  Should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases whereno human life is lost as successful armed defenses?  The question posedto media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this:  Why neglect thecompendious research on successful armed defense, notably bycriminologist Gary Kleck (Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America ,Aldine de Gruyter, 1992)?Kleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use arebased on victimization surveys as well as other studies:  the rate ishigh (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders farebetter than anyone, either those who resort to other forms of resistanceor those who do not resist).  Dividing one million gun defenses a yearby 30,000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense, homicides, suicides, andaccidents) yields 33.  Thus, we can construct a much more favorablestatistic than the NEJM scare stat:  A gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault orother crime than to kill anybody.   Of course, Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation;what is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control.  Weshould indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimationof defensive firearm use, as I have questioned the NEJM statistic. Clearly, the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled byuncritical citation of statistics.   One thing troubles me still:  wecan hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media,  but wehardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned,  even critically.-- Larry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com

Somewhere between 1 out of three and one out of 10 will at some period in their lives experience a violent assault.  The risk is generally higher than emergency medical problemslike heart attack and stroke.'Vast' is probably too loose a term.  With approximately 1,000,000 Americansusing firearms each year, over a 30 year period we get (roughly, since somemay have to do this more than once) 30 MILLION Americans with experience in using firearms for self defense.  30/250 yields 12 percent of the population.(Yes, I know that is a REAL rough estimate.  We're closer to 270 million now, but many of these are minors and should be included etc, thus the percentageif anything is low.)At any rate, most minority groups in this range are not usually referred to as 'tiny' minorities, so I don't see how the other part of the group can be referred to as the 'vast' majority.  A little more work might support a 'simple' majority of Americans never use, own or display a firearm.Certainly when you are talking about OWNERSHIP you are wrong.

The BDs had absolutely NO RIGHT to fireupon the BATF agents. If they didn't know who they were atfirst, then they should have surrendered immediately when theydid realize who they were dealing with. Little groups of looniesdo not get to decide just what laws they will obey or disobeyor what sorts of warrants are justified. Like the rest of us,they get their say at the voting booth and if their personalwants are not backed by the majority of voters, then too bad.If they wanted to keep automatic weapons, then they could applyfor the proper permits. If they had a problem with the warrantthen they get to argue that in court. In no event do they getto establish their own little nation inside our own and pretendthat our laws and law-enforcement personel have no jurisdictionwithin their borders. You live on US territory, you live byUS laws - period. (unless you are a congressman)Sure, the situation was handled badly by both the BATF andthe FBI. It would have been all so easy to detain Koresh andhis core members while they were out in the streets of Waco.The BATF, threatened with budget cuts, was trying for apropaganda coup ... and dragging the press along for the bigcommando-style assault is proof of that. They should beroasted for both their imcompetance and their mindset. On theother hand, they DID have the legal right to do what they did.Once the attack was begun, they should have pressed on andfinished it rather than let an interminable situation like thattake root. The FBI also used poor judgement in a number of ways - but again,the laws we voters have approved, or the lawmakers who createdthem, gave them the right to do what they did. If BATF andthe FBI are latter-day Gestapo, it is because the voters haveallowed them to become that way. Waco was pure Americana -militarist mentality, religious fanaticism and unadulteratedviolence all rolled into one experience. We get what we payfor, or vote for, and this was the result of many choiceswe have made over the years. Don't blame 'them' - blame ourselves. We made 'them', we ARE 'them'.

 20Those of us who questioned the mass suicide line may still have wondered, "If it wasn't suicide, why did so few get out?"  The answer is now available - the gas the government had been pouringin on them is so disabling that its use in wartime is banned by thechemical weapons treaty.The U.S. had agreed not to use this gas against enemy soldiers inwartime, but used it in peacetime against civilians, including nnocent children.For confirmation see Friday's CLINTON:AM press briefing by GeorgeStephanopoulous, posted in alt.news-media and other locations.(When questioned about it, his reply was that the treaty didnot forbid its internal use by law enforcement agencies.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------This posting from Stephen F.

 54Originator: thomasp@surt.ifi.uio.noI have NEVER spoken for a ban against guns in America !What I've said is that there seems to be to MANY of them, and especiallyto many in wrong hands....Now IF you would like to reduce the number, how would you do it without affectinggood/responcible gun owners ??I DO believe in a persons freedom.What I don't believe is that you can have it all and don't pay for it.MOST europeans believe in a society of individuals, and that you HAVEto give 'a little' to make that society work.Cars and guns should really not be mixed, I just tried to make a point.Like America, Norway has some spaces you have to cross to get from a to b,so a car is essential in most parts....Guns on the other hand are not essential in Norway, so we don't argue that IF we 'banned' guns we HAVE to ban cars.....EVERYONE who believe that Hitler and WW2 could be avoided if there weremore guns in Germany in the 30's: PLEASE read some HISTORY!Is this discussion about1. Banning weapons for ALL Americans            or2.

If Koresh & Co. set the fires, why wait through six hours ofwall-bashing and tear-gassing before starting; was there anything "new"that happened just around that point?  Similarly, if the FBI were goingto torch the place (and fake it, of course), why wait so long, wouldn'tit be more "reasonable" to believe the BD's would set the fire earlyafter the assault began?  The most plausible (to me) explaination is that of an accidental startingof the fire by the tanks.  Among other things, I say that because Iwas listening to the radio when the fire started and the reporter(watching from a distance, of course) said that it looked like at leastone of the tanks had penetrated farther into the building than previously.Specifically, he said that one tank apparently was halfway (half ofthe tank's lenght) into the building where it previously had only been penetrating a few feet.reserving judgement,-Aaron
 19Today Rush was criticizing Clinton for not claiming responsibility for theactions and decisions of Janet Reno and the  FBI  early enough to suitRush.About 2 months ago Rush was chortling over the fact that Reagan has stumped"special persecutor Walsh" with his croaking of "I don't remember" whenasked about Ollie North.If Rush's criticism of Clinton were to be applied to Reagan and North... Reagan would have been impeached while North was convicted (and overturned ona technicality).Gosh, Rush sure wants to have it both ways... Clinton MUST be held responsible, but Reagan was clever by using the "amnesia defense".Maybe that's waht Clinton should say about campaign promises and such"Well, there you go again Rush...  but to tell the truth, I wasn't in theloop and I just don't remember."

Lots of heat in otherwords.None of the powder kegs ignited.  One 1lb can of pistol powder ignited.No explosion, as the can opened at the seam as it was designed to do.The black powder cans were charred and got so hot the plastic lidscompletely melted and ran down inside.  The smokless powder wascontained mostly in 8 lb cardboard or metal kegs.  The kegs were charredbadly enough that the paper labels burned completely off and in the caseof the metal cans, the plastic lids melted completely away.Many of the rounds cooked off.  They were in close proximity to woodon all sides so the effects were easy to observe.  In most cases with therifle ammo, the cartridge cases ruptured in the middle.  Many bullets werefound still in the neck.  Small shards of brass were lightly stuck into the wood.  Lightly enough that brushing them with a fingertip would usuallydislodge them.  Primers generally popped out of the primer pockets.The .45ACP rounds that cooked off left empty cases and bullets laying around.No dents were observed above the storage area, indicating the bulletsleft the cases slowly enough not to be a hazard.Ordinary small arms ammo is NOT a hazard when cooking off regardlessof what the FBI says.

EDT     THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federalagents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the lawagainst the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiledweaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-daystandoff ensued.     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made everyreasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end withoutbloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts wereultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they weredealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probablyinsane.     He engaged in numerous activities which violated bothfederal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover,responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during theaction against the compound in February.  Given his inclinationtowards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, noprovocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federalagents against the compound.     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno onan operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure onKoresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.The plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, evenin the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not causepermanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the peoplein the compound to come outside and to surrender.     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  Idiscussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions Ithought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do whatshe thought was right, and I take full responsibility for theimplementation of the decision.     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.Mr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federalagents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were hiscaptives, as well as all the other people who were there who did notsurvive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimateresponsibility for the carnage that ensued.     Now we must review the past with an eye towards thefuture.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice andTreasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation touncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have beendne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independentprofessional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  Iexpect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is requiredto complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments tocooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we cancontinue to be fully accountable to the American people.     I want to express my appreciation to the AttorneyGeneral, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on thefront lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficultcircumstances.     Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorryfor the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the endof this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will betempted to join cults and to become involved with people like DavidKoresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen overthe last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficultsituations which federal agents confronted there and which they willbe doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the futurewill be somewhat better handled and better understood because of whathas been learned now.     Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why,after 51 days, you decided --     Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it isthat Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversationwith --     THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will gofirst and then the other.     Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --     Q  Mr. President --     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but Ican't do it at once.     Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday aboutthe nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney Generalthat the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take anotherstep in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And shedescribed generally what the operation would be -- that they wantedto go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to causepermanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make itvery difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it washoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.     I was further told that under no circumstances would ourpeople fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going toshoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them andthere would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awfullot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.There were no shots coming back from the government side.     I asked a number of questions.  The first question Iasked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasonsI was given were the following:     Number one, that there was a limit to how long thefederal authorities could maintain with their limited resources thequality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might beneeded in other parts of the country.     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this hadnever seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convincedthat no progress had been made recently and no progress was going tobe made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cultmembers to come out.     Number three, that the danger of their doing somethingto themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, withthe passage of time.     And number four, that they had reason to believe thatthe children who were still inside the compound were being abusedsignificantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary andunsafe conditions.     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they hadgiven consideration to all of the things that could go wrong andevaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She saidthat the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them wereconvinced that the chances of bad things happening would onlyincrease with the passage of time.     The third question I asked was, has the military beenconsulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco,that's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obviousthat this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Militarypeople were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and someof the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if themilitary had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that theyhad, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only oneminor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelmingsignificance.     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, Isaid that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that sheshould proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by thattoday.     Q  Mr. President --     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.     Q  Can you address the widespread perception --reported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you weretrying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The onlyreason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the onlyreason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing toadd to what was being said and I literally did not know until ratherlate in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those whohad been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken intocustody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for eventsto unfold.     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why peoplespeculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney Generalon the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.I called her again late last night after she appeared on the LarryKing Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- itis not possible for a President to distance himself from things thathappen when the federal government is in control.     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprisedwould be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that theAttorney General should resign because some religious fanaticsmurdered themselves.  (Applause.)     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in thislife to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  Thesepeople killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They wereheavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly,and they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could toavoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolatethemselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about thechildren.     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno,is when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want youto tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- whyyou believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And shesaid, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that thosechildren are still being abused and that they're in increasinglyunsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easierwith time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word forthat.  So that is where I think things stand.     Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this wasmishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out ofpatience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you reallydecide that way?     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assumeis just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI hasdone a lot of things right for this country over a long period oftime.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed theWorld Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiryto analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else weshould have known?  Is there some other question they should haveasked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I sayfor sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to makethe outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I wantthe inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we havesome independent law enforcement people, not political people, buttotally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the bestevidence we have.     There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort offanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront itagain.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do,particularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it isimportant to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were thepeople who killed others and then killed themselves.     Q  Mr. President, were there any other optionspresented to you for resolving this situation at any point fromFebruary 28th until yesterday?     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports allalong the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you goback -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very goodjob of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursuedany number of other options all along the way, and a lot of themearly on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some ofthe other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed tobe some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and theauthorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and thingsjust began to spin downward.     Whether there were other -- in terms of what happenedyesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did notinvolve other options except whether we should take more time withthe present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said theywanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to getpeople out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.That's what they thought.     Q  Did the government know that the children did nothave gas masks?     Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- areyou in agreement with that?     THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can dowhatever they want.  But I think it's very important that theTreasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bringin some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if anycongressional committees want to look into it, we will fullycooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably themost well-covered operation of its kind in the history of thecountry.   (more, more) -30-

It is my opinion that most educatedor well informed people of this country have some distrust of the government.This should exist because as a bureaucracy, any government given enough timewill tend to exist for it self and not for the original purpose it was created for.  This distrust by the people should keep those in power in-line.That and a properly functioning press.  When a sensationalism oriented pressportrays a group of people as "nuts" or crazies, a violation of thosepeople's civil rights seem justified.   Since we, as American's, have the gurantee of rights as enumerated in the constitution, to include the2nd ammendment, the government must appease the public's opinion or risk voted out of existance, or if it has become corrupt enough to tamper withdomocratic process itself, being thrown out by force.  Our government as it stands, must appease the public.  Therefore the official press releases portray the BD's as fanatics who are a threat topublic safety.  We must not prejudge people based on one sided information.So far the only information that we are being given is comming from the veryagency that was embarrased by the BD(Branch Davidians sp?).  It is to theiradvantage to make the BD's as fanatical and dangerous as possible.  If theywere portrayed as law-abiding citizen's, then they(ATF) had no justificationwhat so ever of doing what they did.   So let's keep an open mind.  Jokes like above, even though it may be funny,may mislead the public from the truth of the matter.Just as an aside,  my understanding of U.S. vs Rock Island and U.S. vs Daltonleads me to believe that the National Firearms Act, which allows the Fed's(in this case ATF) to regulate firearms(machine guns), has been deemed to beunconstitutional since 1986.(By two federal district courts at least).And since, I believe the only reason ATF was involvedin this case is because of firearms violations, it would be interesting to find out whether or not the search warrent was based on the NFA.It would be very embarrassing indeed if a search warrent based on a possiblyunconstitutional law has resulted in 4 deaths(Law enforcement). ****************************************************************************The above opinions are mine and mine only.I'm solely responsible for my opinions and my actions.

Our society does not,   >however, condone their possession or use.  Actually, Joe, I wrote the above.  Peter was responding to my article.I'm actually rather confused by your post.  I suppose I didn'tmake myself clear, cause you seem to have gotten exactly theopposite impression from what I intended.  I suppose "the authorities"might have been a better term than "society".  Carry and use a firearmin many parts of the country (certainly the parts I live in), and expect,at the very least, to have an awful lot of explaining to do.And there is also appears to be  a trend in society at large thatactively opposes what many see as their right to defend themselves.   In a few other parts of our society, handguns are banned or   so restricted as to be practically unavailable to the law-   abiding citizen for self-defense outside the home.  Funny,    though, how the criminals in such places continue to have a    lush supply of guns and no compunctions about using them.     IMHO, you don't need to be either a political philosopher or    a crime victim to realize that there's a flaw in the gun-   grabbers' logic.  Agreed.   You're welcome to your HO, too, the First Amendment being as    important as the Second, but please don't let your obvious    good intentions be subverted by insupportable generalities    about something as big and diverse as US society.My only intention was to comment that the existence of suitableweapons of self defense doesn't mean you'll escape a whole shitloadof trouble should you be forced to use them.   Or by the   naive hope that making gun possession a crime will give pause    to someone who would be a criminal anyway.I made no such statements, nor do I have such a naive hope or outlook.        Wishing you peace and the wherewithal to defend yourself   if others' thoughts are not that kindly,That's all I want: the opportunity to leave in peace, or to have the means to defend myself when that in not possible.I *think* we agree on this issue.

Is it theendangerment of others, so we do a 5' restriction, or the possibilityof being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke anddraw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamentalflaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placingthe responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user.Perhaps Sen.

The State having controlover the heavy weapons should not be justification for the stateto have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such thatthe ability of the State to lock them up isn't so easy.  Otherwise,I would have to assume that State control would rest on theauthority of the Governor and militia officers.>That is eaxctly why I think they should be removed: The select>militia should privide the militia's heavy weapons and highly-trained>specialists.

Similarly, the>select militia should be incapable of action without the>aid of the general militia.I'm having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons,fairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a fewpeople with government support.  Just as you argued above thatthe weapons should be divvied up and under democratic controlso one side doesn't have all of them, I can't see where thissituation is alleviated in having the select militia holdingall the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry.I think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue thatthe Federal army should rely upon the select militia and theunorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.>Consider, then, the effect of removing the National Guard's>infantry and placing the Guard under the control of local>governments. The government-controled select militia could>not fight effectively without infantry support provided by>the general militia (an inherently infantry organization.) >On the other hand, the general militia could function (although>at a disadvantage) without the backing of local governments and>the select militia.We have to assume that there would be those who wouldside with the government-controlled forces, and if they've allthe equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble.I'd like to see that heavy stuff, say tanks, offset by thelocal troups having a few 105's and anti-tank weapons in theirarmory.  These would be much more useful to infantry than thetank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in.I suppose I'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.>>...but a mechanized infantry unit is what builds>>dikes in times of flood, sets up disaster relief cities, and>>the like.>>I would much rather see these things handled by the local, >general militias.So would I, but the resources often aren't available tooutfit local units well enough.

I thinkmain battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and upfield pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 tontrucks, HumVee's, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuffof a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard unitsin Iowa are currently fielding in some units.Perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavyequipment under State control, with little but numbers and lightstuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to thestates should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the localranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly,hence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally,the militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed forother responses.  The Federal army, I'm convinced, should have avery minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militiasfor these functions.< Dan Sorenson, DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu ><  ISU only censors what I read, not what I say.

The "used to kill" is the heart of the misinformation.  It's oneof those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression.What Mr. Quiqley is more than aware of, I'm sure, is that when peopleread this they think violent arguments where one member of the familygrabs a gun and shoots another, thereby creating a tragic situationwhich could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there, ora tragic accident, especially involving a child.       Unfortunately, that's not the way things stack up.  The majorityof that 43 "times" (37 I believe) are suicides.  That is, someone intentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill themselves.  And why it's popular to try and blame suicides on guns,the evidence doesn't support this.  Internal studies, as well ascomparative studies with other countries, indicate that culturalfactors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not.(Japan, for instance, has a slightly higher rate than the U.S.  Therepeople jump off buildings.)       According to the National Crime Survey, 40% of violent crimeis commited by "non-strangers," which mistakenly has been generalizedregarding the King County study to mean, "Friends and family."  Thatis, Mr. Quigley, and others who quote this statistic, are banking onthe mental image that a "Friend, family member, or child," equatesto a loving relationship, and that it was cut short in a moment ofanger.  Unfortunately, all too often husbands beat and kill wives,children assault parents, or vice-versa.  Most rapes are commited by someone known to the victim, for instance.  Essentially, that a gunwas used against a "friend" or family member doesn't mean theyweren't trying to hurt the other person.  Crime is highest amongpoor urban families, and those are also the areas most "at risk"for family problems, especially violent ones.  A son in a gang maynot be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburbankid might.       Finally, it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is theonly value of a self-defense firearm.  Using the minimum figures Iworked out using the NCS I got about an 80:1 ratio between deadlyself-defenses (justifiable homicides) and with-gun self-defenses.Between the FBI Uniform Crime report and the NCS there's an enormousamount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers.As such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only validmeans of determining the success of such a defense, since accordingto the NCS (which has been considered by many to seriously under-reportdefenses) there were far more successful with-gun defenses than intruderskilled.       Not it also confines itself to the home, where attack by a "friendor family member" is far, far more likely, and excludes any defensewhich occurs outside the home.  (I believe a large number occur inbusinesses.)>Studies by the >Western Psychiatric Institute, in Pittsburgh, found that the mere presence>of a gun in the home sharply incresases the likelihood a family member>will commit suicide, even in the absence of psychiatric illness."       I have not seen the exact data for this, so I can't comment.  Iwill point out Canada's and Japan's suicide rate as indications thatculture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates.       There was also a comparative study between Canada (for whatit's worth, considering the difficulty of comparing across culturallines) published in the New England Journal of Medicine (I can get theexact cite if you need it) that concluded that restrictive firearm laws would not significantly impact the over-all suicide rate.------------------------------------------------------------------------David Veal Univ. of Tenn.

Some might consider them just a an organization to create a network of support among conservatives for some individuals in prep. for '96 run.You'd be close to the truth.Their two leading spokesmen are Bill Bennett, former 'Drug Czar' who heartilysupported Bush's semi-auto import ban, and wondered if it went far enough - who helped put the big lie about 'sporting use' into the public's eye - andJack Kemp - who recently came out in support of semi-auto bans.

Ah, clarification by obfuscation.Actually, the words "A well regulated Milita, being necessary to thesecurity of a free state" is a present participle, used as anadjective to modify 'militia', which is followed by the main clause ofthe sentence, the subject being 'the right', the verb 'shall'.  Itasserts that the right to keep and bear arms is essential formaintaining a milita.  The sentence doesn't restrict the right, orstate or imply possession of the right by anyone or anything otherthan the people.  All it does is make a positive statement regarding aright of the people. The PEOPLE, as in you and me, as in the First,Fourth, Ninth, Tenth, as well as the Second amendment.The existence of this right is assumed - it is not granted by theamendment. There is no stated or implied condition relating the rightto bear arms to the necessity of a well-regulated militia to the security ofa free state.In other words, the entire sentence says that the right to keep andbear arms is UNCONDITIONAL.>So in effort not to force my views and not "to destory our Liberties and>Rights,"  I state that nothing I have written, or will write, in>the matter of "Liberties and Rights" is the final word.

 29Flash over is a frequent occurrence with indoor fires.  A fire willstart small and in one location and heat the air.  The temperature inthe room builds up and then everything inflammable in the room catchesfire at once. This may have occurred in the BD compound, I have heard reports thatthe windows were covered which would permit a fire to start unnoticedby those outside the compound.  When the fire got big enough, andbroke through the walls, it appeared to be started in two places butwas really one big fire. Because of the large quantities of tear gas inserted into the buildingit is possible that many of the women and children were in a room freeof tear gas they would try to seal the door to keep out the tear gas.When they learned that a fire had broken out it was too late for themto escape.  They were trapped by the flames in their safe room. I find it hard to believe that the FBI was not recording the finalassault.  I think that they would have wanted to have tapes to showtheir agents of the the FBI overcoming the "forces of evil", akathe Branch Davidians.  The tapes would also allow the FBI to provethat they were not using excessive force. --Rod Anderson  N0NZO            | The only acceptable substituteBoulder, CO                    | for brains is silence.rcanders@nyx.cs.du.edu         |       -Solomon Short-satellite  N0NZO on ao-16      |

In the very clear-cut situation of your hypothetical,I wouldn't have anything to fear from the police (unless I had beenpublicly carrying the weapon concealed, something I'm not inthe habit of doing... Even then, the worst I'd have to deal with was a class 2 misdemeanor.) Even if the situation were not soclear, and I might have to worry about arrest for manslaughter orhomicide, it would still be safer to wait for the police. IfI were to leave and try to avoid police involvement, I'd be committingseveral felonies and ruining my chances of claiming self-defencein court ("If it really was self-defence," the prosecuter wouldask, "why did you run away and hide from the police?")In other states, however, this decision might not be so clear-cut:If someone in, say, Washington D.C. were to use a gun in self-defencehe would _automatically_ be guilty of several felony violations ofthat city's gun control laws. Such a person's choices would bebetween certain conviction for a couple of felonies versus possibleconviction for half a dozen.

 136Originator: vojak@icebucket.stortek.comNntp-Posting-Host: icebucket.stortek.comHere is a letter I sent to David Skaggs, (Dem, CO).  Before anybody sayssomething, yes the letter is a bit "sharp" in tone.  I have been writtingreasonable and polite letters to him for years, and all I get in returnin the HCI party line.  Since he already is NRA F rated, I don't think thatupsetting him will harm the cause.  Sorry if you disagree, but recent eventsin Texas REALLY have me pissed.-------------------April  20, 1993Representative Skaggs,Recently I wrote to you regarding my outrage over the tactics used by theBureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, (BATF), in Texas.  In your responseyou stated that "Events in Texas underscore the need for stricter gun controllegislation to keep guns out of the hand of groups such as the Branch Davidians.My question to you is, "what grounds would you use to deny them access to firearms?"  Best I can tell this statement underscores your apparent totalignorance of the subject, and highlights your personal bias against firearms.I say this because there are only two possible paths of "gun control" which youcould have been referencing.Either:1) You were talking about their access to semi-automatics firearms.  In thiscase I should point out that semi-automatic firearms are legal in most areas ofthis Country, including Texas and Colorado.  In addition the members of the"cult" have never been convicted of any crimes which would deny them the abilityto purchase these weapons.  So under what grounds would you deny them theseguns?  Their religion?  The fact they they live in a large group alone bythemselves?  Because you consider them to be a cult?  Maybe I consider yourChurch to be a cult!This line of reasoning by you borders on the concept of "thought crimes."  Youand Pat Robertson should really get along.2) You were referring to the ALLEGED FULLY automatic weapons possessed by the"cult."  Under current US law, FULLY automatic weapons have been covered bysome of the strictest gun control laws in this Nation.  So if David Koreshillegally possessed them, he would have had to circumvent some of the strictestlaws we have.  How will more laws help?  By the way, it has been reported thatDavid Koresh possessed a Federal Firearms License which would have permitted him to possess FULLY automatic weapons.  If true, the 85 people who perishedMonday in the fire, died so that the Federal government could collect a couplehundred dollars in taxes on guns David Koresh didn't declare.I have heard claims that they were "stockpiling weapons."  Yet considering thenumber of people in the complex, even 200+ weapons would not have been out ofline with gun ownership statistics for all of Texas.  What's next?  A siege ofDallas/Ft Worth for alleged "stockpiling?"Face it David Skaggs, You have voted for virtually EVERY gun control law thathas passed through Congress, yet you claim that you are only for "reasonable"restrictions.  Bull****!   Handgun Control Inc. is struggling to maintain250,000 PAID members, while the NRA has just exceeded 3,000,000 members.  Theyare still growing at a rate of 2,000 new members per day.

 50For those who didn't figure it out, the below message was a reply to anotherin sci.crypt, for which the poster put t.p.g. in the Followup-To line. Ididn't notice that. Apologies to those who were confused.The substance makes little sense unless one reads the prior messages.However, I don't wish to enter into this discussion here, as it will be yetanother rehearsal of a long-tired set of arguments. Suffice it to say that Idisagree both with the interpretation of "well-regulated" in the SecondAmendment offered by gun lovers, and what I think to be their distortion ofthe same phrase in the associated Federalist papers. My Webster and myreading of the language convinces me that the word meant both under control,and disciplined, and not 'of good marksmanship'. I think the latter aspecial interest pleading. No one has yet shown a contemporateous referencein which "well regulated" unambiguously meant 'of good marksmanship', andnot under control/disciplined, etc.Thus I continue to believe the Second Amendment is a militia clause and notan 'arming everyone' clause. Others are welcome to disagree (as I know manydo) and little would be served by rehashing this topic in this particularforum.To avoid flames, or unproductive rehashings, I note that I've come in hereto post this one message, just to clarify the one below.

You'd have to be very unfamiliar with US history to   think that we have substantially fewer rights today than in   in 1932.  The police could generally get away with a lot more  in those days, there were few citizens and media "watchdog"   organizations, no "Miranda" rulings, and women, blacks, gays,  and other such groups had very few right indeed.  Moreover  censorship of media and similar artistic expression was rampant  at that time (think about "banned in Boston" or the Hays  Commission).    My comments were directed against those who see these sorts  of incidents as proof that rights as we know them are about to   vanish.---peter

By the way, where did I say that they were minorities?  Do you thinkthat only minorities have gangs?  Not so.  As far as the quotes are concernedit was totally obvious that they weren't just practicing for marksmanship.  Idon't know about you but I have never seen anyone else practice marksmanship bytaking their gun out of their coat as fast as possible and start shooting.  Ifyou would have been there Andy it would've been obvious to you too.  Of courseit might not have been.  Who knows.  All I do know is that I was there, I livehere and I know that they were gang bangers.  When you live here long enough itbecomes pretty easy to spot them via gang colors, gang signs, etc.  One lastthing.  My sister is a social worker.  She makes it her point to find thesethings out (gang signs, colors, etc) because it is in her best interest to doso.

There are not all that many people|who have both the skill AND motivation to assemble worthwhile|firearms from scratch. High-ranking crime figures could|obtain imported Uzis and such, but the average person, and|average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun - and would|pay through the nose for it. This is not borne out of reality; the old Soviet Union had a veryserious domestic handgun and submachinegun trade, guns that wereof commercial grade because they were produced in honest-to-goodnessmachineshops. Why would all production have to be local; don't wehave a road system that is the envy of the world?I seem to recall incidents in the past where Chinese entreprenaursattempted to smuggle AK-47s (semi-autos) into this country toget around import number limitations (May have been Gunweek whereI read that years ago...)Any person with high-school drafting skills and vocational schoolmachineshop training could produce a submachinegun. You talk aboutthe average person not being able get even a zip-gun; well now, thinkof all that private CNC controlled machinery that is not being used for3 shifts a day; do you think that if guns were being sold on theblack market for say, $150, an enterprising mechanical engineercould be using that machinery to produce workable submachinegunsfor sale? After all, GUNWEEK had an article and pictures on how BATFwas looking for the manufacturer of quite efficient silencers thatwere of commercial quality and finish.Look at it this way, 25% of the U.S. households have a handgun. Sayat least half of those keep one for self-defense. You are talking apotential market of of tens of millions of people who would seekfirearms for the purpose of self-preservation. Only a fool wouldbelieve that market would not be filled, regardless of governmentprohibitions.

He heard SOME KIND OF EXPLOSIVES go off, he saw he was beingATTACKED with no overt action from him (yet).  He could no more say 'oh,its ok, its only stun grenades' anymore than I could.  He slammed the door atthat point and proceeded to repel the attackers.  He felt in genuine fearof his life - I know I would be in fear of MY life at that point.  Haveyou ever been shot at?  How clear and logically could you think, underthat pressure, when you MIGHT have ALL OF 1 or 2 SECONDS to evaluatewhat is going on?  And, it would not be the first time that 'lawenforcements' intended to bring in their suspect horizontally.  Forall we know, he was informed by someone saying something like "Hey,guy, the BATF is coming like gangbusters, and they mean to WASTE you..."According to the latest news, the released warrant (so we are told) saidthe reason for this WW III raid was that Korash's group had spent around$200,000.00 on firearms and related stuff (over an undetermined period).Now, even assuming that the figure isn't calculated like the Feds do adrug siezure, for 90 people, that isn't really all that much (you priceddecent guns lately?).  Hell, I can think of a person right now that probablyhas that much for ONE INDIVIDUAL, mostly machineguns!!!  Sure, he isan avid collector, but unless a new law has been passed, it is NOT illegal,nor an indication of anything illegal, to have a lot of guns.  Also notethat the warrant had NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT MACHINE GUNS.  So, whatis the justification of this cowboy raid, other than a romp gone badfor some anti-gun media hype, to support Clinton's push for disarmingthe unconnected citizen of any and all effective defensive weapons?This administration has only one thing in mind.

The idea that my Ruger Mark II Bull Barrel (a semi-auto 0.22 caliberhandgun) was designed to kill or hurt people, even for self defense,would, I'm sure, come as a surprise to its designer.  It certainly isn'twhy I have it.  It certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it,and might even kill them, but it is simply wrong to say it was designed tokill people.>This is not designed to act as a tool for home  defence where you show>someone  that you have a gun and they go "Gee, perhaps I should leave".In fact, that is what happens most of the time.  Most self defensive usesof firearms don't involve firing any shots.  Most criminals would prefernot to be shot, and will go to some effort not to be, including doing whatyou say when you point a gun at them.If you were called on to design a tool, that could be easily carried, toimmediately stop someone attacking you, what would it be?  A handgun isabout the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does workthe best.[3]>No, you see the gun was designed to fire that little bullet into a human>body and hurt them.  Not a tough concept to swallow, for most.Certainly, no one argues that handguns (of the type we are discussing)aren't deadly weapons.  However, it simply isn't true to say that all ofthem were designed to kill people.  Moreover, what exactly is wrong withhaving deadly weapons?  There are times when it is perfectly legitimate touse deadly force, e.g. in self defense.  I consider it not just my right,but my duty to defend myself and my family, and that includes having andknowing how to use the tools to do that."The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and beararms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny ingovernment."- T.

Right?Right, but there are times when killing things is called for.  I hope Inever have to shoot a person, but I've had to kill a number of animals fromrodents to cows, and when I do, I don't want them to suffer any more thanis necessary.  I prefer they die instantly, but failing that, I want themto drop so I can quickly finish them with the next shot, and failing that,I don't want them to go fast or far.  I try to choose the best weapon andammunition I have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal I'mafter, but it doesn't always work as I plan.  Without belaboring the point,people who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns,particularly handguns, haven't used them much for that purpose.[1] Accidental deaths in 1988:48700 deaths by auto11300 deaths by fall 5300 deaths by drowning 4800 deaths by fire 4400 deaths by poison 3200 deaths by food 1400 deaths by firearm     Source: Statistics Department, National Safety Council.

At the rate of the last sixty years, it will reach zero sometime around 2025 AD.CONCLUSION==========Firearms have been a declining factor in accidental deaths for over sixty years, despite rising per-capita gun ownership.[1] = Year.[2] = Population.[3] = Accidental deaths.[4] = Accidental deaths per 1,000,000.[1]   [2]          [3]    [4]       [1]   [2]          [3]    [4]   1932  124,840,000  3,000  24.03     1961  183,691,000  2,204  12.001933  125,579,000  3,014  24.00     1962  186,538,000  2,092  11.21     1934  126,374,000  3,033  24.00     1963  189,242,000  2,263  11.96     1935  127,250,000  2,799  22.00     1964  191,889,000  2,275  11.86     1936  128,053,000  2,817  22.00     1965  194,303,000  2,344  12.06     1937  128,825,000  2,576  20.00     1966  196,560,000  2,558  13.01     1938  129,825,000  2,726  21.00     1967  198,712,000  2,896  14.57     1939  130,880,000  2,618  20.00     1968  200,706,000  2,394  11.93     1940  132,122,000  2,375  17.98     1969  202,677,000  2,309  11.39     1941  133,402,000  2,396  17.96     1970  204,879,000  2,406  11.74     1942  134,860,000  2,678  19.86     1971  207,661,000  2,360  11.36     1943  136,739,000  2,282  16.69     1972  209,896,000  2,442  11.63    1944  138,397,000  2,392  17.28     1973  211,909,000  2,618  12.35    1945  139,928,000  2,385  17.04     1974  213,854,000  2,613  12.22    1946  141,389,000  2,801  19.81     1975  215,854,000  2,380  11.03    1947  144,126,000  2,439  16.92     1976  218,035,000  2,059   9.44    1948  146,631,000  2,191  14.94     1977  220,239,000  1,982   9.00    1949  149,188,000  2,330  15.62     1978  222,585,000  1,806   8.11    1950  151,684,000  2,174  14.33     1979  225,055,000  2,004   8.901951  154,287,000  2,247  14.56     1980  227,757,000  1,955   8.58    1952  156,954,000  2,210  14.08     1981  230,138,000  1,871   8.131953  159,565,000  2,277  14.27     1982  232,520,000  1,756   7.55    1954  162,391,000  2,271  13.98     1983  234,799,000  1,695   7.22    1955  165,275,000  2,120  12.83     1984  237,001,000  1,668   7.04    1956  168,221,000  2,202  13.09     1985  239,279,000  1,649   6.89    1957  171,274,000  2,369  13.83     1986  241,613,000  1,600   6.62    1958  174,141,000  2,172  12.47     1987  243,915,000  1,400   5.74    1959  177,073,000  2,258  12.75           1960  180,671,000  2,334  12.92Sources: U.S. Bureau of the Census, Historical Statistics of the United States, Colonial Times to 1970, Bicentennial Edition, Part 2, Washington, DC, 1975.U.S. Bureau of the Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States: 1982-83.

Months toget ready, unlimited funds, knowledge of a threatened mass suicide by fire,and no fire trucks on hand?   This is "extreme professionalism and care?"      I can understand the first screwed-up raid by the BATF.  Theyunderestimated the opposition, which happens.  But not this one.  The FBI had their first team in place, massive resources, ample time for planning and bringing up any specialized equipment or people necessary.  They still botched it.      The FBI Director and the FBI SAC in overall charge should resign,or be fired for incompetence.      I don't blame Reno or Clinton.  They gave the FBI clear orders:don't go in unless you can do it without casualties; if you can't do that,wait it out.  Those were reasonable orders.  The FBI said they couldpull off a tactical solution, and they couldn't.John Nagle

 44Everyone is complaining about the debacle in Waco. It is hard to understand all this angst. What happend there is nothing less thanwhat we wanted to happen. Why all the sour grapes ?BATF was looking for a propaganda event to counteract their impendingbudget cuts ... the attendance of the press at the initial bigcommando raid is proof. It would have been ever so easier to grabKoresh and his central followers as they shopped in Waco. Alas, nopropaganda value there. The FBI screwed-up big time, all the time. They should have never allowedthe situation to drag out like that. A quick second assault, before theBDs could decide on a strategy, would have been the better plan. The BDs themselves were the biggest screw-ups though. They imaginedthat US law and US law-enforcement had no jurisdiction within theirlittle 'country'. WRONG ! They had no right whatsoever to fire onthe BATF, and if they mistook their identity initially, they shouldhave surrendered at once when they did realize who they were. If theBDs had a problem with the warrants, they take it to court, just likethe rest of us. If they wanted full-auto weapons, they could haveobtained the proper permits, just like the rest of us would need todo. What they may NOT do is decide for themselves what US law appliesto themselves and which does not. They get their chance like the restof us - at the voting booth. If the BATF and FBI have become latter-day Gestapo, then they havebecome that way because WE have desired them to be so. We get tovote on laws, and on the lawmakers. By our choices over the years,we have approved the creation and form of the BATF and FBI. Whenthe FBI was out chasing 'pinkos', the general public didn't seemto mind a bit of extra-constitutional activity. When the BATF israiding militant black organizations, we don't mind the heavy hand.When the FBI is dicking around with the rights of potheads, thepublic doesn't mind. Suddenly, when we see a bit of ourselves inthe current 'enemy' choosen by these agencies, we get all bent outof shape. SUPRISE ! You reap what you sow.Waco was an encapsulation of the All-American experience - religiousfanaticism, militaristic thinking and overwhelming violence. Don'tblame it on 'them', the FBI and BATF. They were just acting withinthe parameters we have set over the years. We made 'them'. We ARE 'them'.-- Jim Mason

Did Bush veto it?  If so, when? Also, the state of Virginia, I believe, just passed a gun control bill onFebrauary 25 of this year.  I think it limits gun purchases to one a month -is this correct?  What was the bill number? Anyone?

Afairly simple problem, given our size and numbers.  Do you agree?  Weall believe criminals, particularly violent criminals, should not havefirearms.  The problem is making a law that does this without troddingupon the rights of the vast majority.  Nobody here seems to be able todo it, and I doubt anybody in Norway can either.  Thus, we are left witha philosophical difference: does the safety of a few justify restrictingthe many?  We say "no," while others say "yes.">Now IF you would like to reduce the number, how would you do it without>affecting good/responcible gun owners ??Can you provide a method that cannot be abused?

What is in contentionis how much one has to pay.>MOST europeans believe in a society of individuals, and that you HAVE>to give 'a little' to make that society work.It is this "giving a little" that makes Americans wary...We have seen this argument before.  You might remember how aChamberlain "gave a little" to a particular fascist/short asshole,and how such "appeasement" worked.  While it might work in someinstances, it doesn't work in others, and since we cannot predictthe future we must be cautious in using actions that have ahistory of failure.>Cars and guns should really not be mixed, I just tried to make a point.>Like America, Norway has some spaces you have to cross to get from a to b,>so a car is essential in most parts....>Guns on the other hand are not essential in Norway, so we don't >argue that IF we 'banned' guns we HAVE to ban cars.....Cars are not essential in Norway any more than they are inthe USA.  I'm willing to bet that you have neighbors that would bewilling to drive you anywhere you wanted to go for a price.  Thus,cars are not essential for your transportation.  However, thearguments presented show that, since cars are used to kill far morepeople than guns in the USA, it makes much more sense to restrictcars than it does guns.  How one defines "essential" often dependsupon what one is willing to go through for that service.  When welook at the raw data, such comparisons are not individually weighed.>EVERYONE who believe that Hitler and WW2 could be avoided if there were>more guns in Germany in the 30's: PLEASE read some HISTORY!This depends upon what the populace was willing to do.  AsDesert Storm proved, even an armed populace won't just revolt evenwhen given a chance.  Still, would Hitler have done all that he didwith an armed populace?  We have to wonder, as some of his firstacts were to confiscate firearms.  Other points in history showthat dictators were overthrown by arms in the hands of the populace.Thus, we're left wondering if Hitler would have been overthrownor if King George was just unlucky in keeping the USA as a colony.One can argue both sides; one also has to live with each action.>Is this discussion about>1. Banning weapons for ALL Americans>            or>2. Making it harder for criminals to get one ??It is about #2, but so far all proposals to curtail #2 havewound up enforcing #1 as well.

If they would ofhad the proper equipment and personal then they could of captured thecompound on the initial assault and none of this would of happened.The BATF needs more people, better weapons and more armoredtransports. When they meet hostile fire they should be able to usemore force instead of retreating to a stand off. If you are going todo a job then do it right. The BATF is there to protect us and theymust have the proper equipment and people to do the job.With the WoD and the increased crime in the streets the BATF is neededmore now then ever. If they blast away a few good fokes then that isthe price we all have to pay for law and order in this country. Lookat all the good people that died in wars to protect this great countryof ours.With the arms build up in Waco they needed to hit that compound withmega fire power. They could of gone in there blasting and killed a fewwomen and kids but it would of been better then letting them all burnto death 51 days later.

Compared to what most criminals use, a9mm with military ammo (FMJs), or a military rifle (use is extremelyrare), .223 or 7.62mm with military ammo (FMJs), the .32 H&R magnum with"civie" bullets is more lethal.  Most of the arms which criminals (andthe military) use are among the least lethal arms in existance.What if we just punish the criminal and leave the law abiding citizenalone?  It hasn't been tried in recient times, but it might work.

And they are very, very good about it, in both thetactical and legal parts of it.

But they had to use their ownguys, nobody elses SWAT team was good enough for the holy cause of guncontrol.   I also find the timing of the raid to be extremely interesting. Initial raid: two days before the NJ senate was going to overturn their"assault weapon" confiscation law; a couple weeks before the BATF's budgetwas going to come up in congress for review;  shortly after Reno gotconfirmed as AG (I don't need to remind you about her anti-gun line);right around the presidents 100th day in office.

Lessee, let's pull out the old Almanac.       In 1980, total U.S. government budget outlays were 590.9 billiondollars.  In 1992 (est) they were 1.4754 trillion dollars, an increase ofapprox. 884 billion dollars.       In 1980, National Defense cost 133.9 billion dollars.  In192 it was 307 billion dollars, and increase of 174 billion dollars.That leaves an increase of 710 billion dollars unaccountedfor.  (This represented an increase of 230%)       In 1980, Income Security (which includes retirement programs,Housing Assitance, and unemployment benefits, and I believe welfare)cost 86.5 billion dollars.  In 1992 it was 198 billion dollars, ormore than national defense started.  (This represented an increaseof 230%)       In 1980, the Federal Government spent 32 billion dollars onMedicare.  In 1992 they spent 118 billion dollars.  (an increase of368%)       In 1980, the Feds spent 9 billion dollars on housingcredits and subsidies of that like.  In 1992 it was 87 billion.       In 1980, Health care services and research was 23 billiondollars.  In 1992, it was 94 billion dollars.       Agriculture, up 9 billion to 17 billion.       Science, up 11 billion to 16 billion.       Resource conservation up 7 billion to 20 billion.       Education up 14 billion to 45 billion.       Veteran benefits up 12 billion to 33 billion.       Trasnportation up 13 billion to 34 billion.            About the only things I see which was seriously decreased was under the Energy category, primarily under "Supply," and "Community Development,"in the area of "disaster relief," and between the two of themrepresent a loss of less than 11 billion dollars.

The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking.                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyramwere murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split overwho to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just likeMohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims considerChrist to be a prophet the same as Jews, I'm led to understand.  Makeno mistake, this was no messiah we're talking about in Smith).  Thethought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handeddown father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was onlyentering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to havebeen bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  TheCouncil of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn't of much helphere, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects.Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waitedfor Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The otherclaimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)Both sects practiced the "1-year food stockpile" doctrine,and this being frontier and farming country most carried or atleast owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were amilitaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather thanface large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered agreat deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quitejustified in making military training a good thing.  Remember,this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these peoplehad nobody to turn to save themselves.Just a little context to put this all in perspective.>So what did the Mormons get?

LDS and RLDSphilosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the trueChurch as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on hisown merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS mayas well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  Youcan only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejectedit.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans toBuddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong theywill not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hooverliked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbadealcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like.These people are the "salt of the Earth" and as such are moreeasily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.That's my somewhat educated guess, anyway.  Both sects havesplinter groups that don't mirror the masses, but these are smalland rare, and hardly worth noting their common ancestry.None of this has any relevance to guns, though.

 19I do not think it is at all unlikely that Clinton ro his policywonk facilitators arranged the Waco raid as a display piece for  theGun War on the Constitution.  Look at what the Bush administration did toget material for the Drug War on the Constitution--remember that baggie ofcrack George waved at the cameras?  They took a dealer from the ghettoand brought him to the White House so they could say drugs had beendealt onb the White House Lawn.And I don't think anybody could honestly think Clinton would have anymoral qualms about the raid...The only really worrisome thing is that the BD's heroic defense oftheir ranch will make Clinton's Gun War on the Constitution _more_successfull--exactly as he wanted.  The media and politicians willfilter this so that the general public will think the BD'sare bad guys!  Don't help them.  Stand up for the BD's with yourfriends and family adnd in public anytime you can--their supposedmoral qualms are not important to the issue.

It canbe used for welding, in miners lamps, for gassing gophers, or formaking carbide bombs and doing some illicit fishing.

Furthermore, if you get specific then the oldstandby is to insert a clause allowing the list of banned things tobe added to, generally without going through the hassles of anothervote and public reading of the law.

Now I'm not going around making these things, but it's not 'cause of anylaw; I simply don't get any marginal benefit out of killing anyone.  Anylaw you enact in this respect is only going to give you the ability to add a charge against someone who does make and use said weapons.  In thecase of chemical agents, I seriously doubt that you would even know thatsomeone had set up a lab until after the weapons had been used.  Part of the trouble with the chemical-weapons ban treaty between the USand the USSR is that many of the precursors to chemical weapons such asGB and Sarin, etc., is that they have very valid commercial uses, and it is very easy to divert those precursors to chemical weapons manufacturewithout anyone knowing about it.>>< Dan Sorenson, DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu >>><  ISU only censors what I read, not what I say.

 38Well, the question of why fire equipment took so long to reach the compound has been answered. ABC aired a report including the 911 tapes from Monday. The FBI called 911 within 4 minutes of the fire's breakout. Unfortunately, dispatch of vehicles outside the Waco city limits required approval of a deputy chief, who was not available (literally out to lunch?); the 911 operator desperately called around to local community volunteer fire departments to get something out there. By the time trucks arrived 27 minutes later, the whole complex was aflame and it was clearly too little, too late; there were just two pumpers and no water supply. The FBI made another call requesting a tank truck, but the Waco department apparently depended on hydrants and did not have one. Though clearly unwilling to risk firemen's lives in the line of fire, it seems they might have done so had there been sufficient equipment and water to make a difference.They even aired a tape of a woman who called Waco 911 from Georgia asking if anything was being done. Civic-minded, but probably irresponsible; if everyone watching television did that, no local calls could get through.ABC also aired the comments of an independent fire investigator who viewed tapes from more than one side of the compound (not just the standard "pool shot"), and agreed that the fire a) must have been started in at least 3 places, and b) must have had an accelerant to spread so fast.Neither of these is conclusive proof that the Koresh crowd offed themselves more than the FBI offed them, but it's a heck of a lot stronger proof than some of the "theories" floating around the net.Score 2 FBI, 0 Branch Davidians.

From the police who I have talked with who run some of these gunbuyback programs, I get the impression that they really think they arehaving an impact on the community.  When I ask them if they have an evaluatorycomponent to the program, they say "well no..."  So, in answer to yourquestion, no, false hope is not the intent.  I think the intent is toshow folks that police are attempting to do something to curb interpersonalgun violence whether its effective or not.  Look, if you can't measurethe impact of these programs using some sort of pre-test and post-testevaluation, what is the point?  It must be symbolic in nature.  The police areessentially saying "look, if you have a gun lying around and you don'twant it, we'll give you $50 for it...because we care about the community".If you, I and Joe could think of a way to measure the effectiveness orineffectiveness of these programs we could become rich and famous. >>>> >>I do know that the vast majority of guns that are used by youths or>> >>brought to school by youths on a daily basis (about 135,000 youths) are>> >>obtained easily and quickly, through a personal friend, or more often>> >>"borrowed" from a parent without their knowledge.>> >>> >I suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these "statistics" - I>> >suspect you'll find if you look carefully that 135,000 is the number of>> >students *estimated* to have carried *a weapon* (not necessarily a gun)>> >to school at least once in the past year, and not the number of students>> >who carry a gun to school daily.>> >>>  Well Joe, I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence>> or the Centers for Disease Control.

 14Just saw a new commercial(?) by the NRA. It starts out with a bunch of politicians talking about how to get rid of crime.They finally realize that they need to put criminals awaylonger but there isn't enough jail space so they decide on another gunlaw.( During this whole seen there quoteing various statistics on howeasy criminals get off ) In the next seen the politician is announceing on tv how this gun law will get rid of crime and there is this grungy looking guy (criminal)watching him on tv just laughing his ass off.Classic.Sean

 48Greetings,    Specious reasoning alert!  Sorry folks, I don't like gun controltoo much, but this is just too crazy.    1)  The main gun control law is similar to (or even BASED ON) aGerman gun control law.    2)  Germany was Controlled With Evil Nazi's at the time.    3)  Nazi's are bad.    Therefore gun control is bad!  (If this seems reasonable to you,try reading it as GunControlIsANaziPlot!  That's pretty much what it'ssaying.)    Look, let's try to beat gun control with reason and sense, not bytrying to appeal to emotions, and threatening conspiracies.  DenounceGCA '68 as wrong because it's WRONG, not because it's based off of alaw from someone else's government.    As for the 'Lots Of Brave Men Died Fighting Nazi's, So Their LawsHave No Place On Our Books!'  Well, lots of brave men died fightingEngland.  Wanna bet we've got lots of English laws on our books?  Oh,but they're our ALLIES now, so everything's hunky-dory.  I'm *VERY*sure that the GCA is not the only law that we have on the books whichis similar, or even based on, a law on the german books.  HOWEVER,that does not give invalidation in and of itself.    WE, THE PEOPLE, must state that we find the law unappealing andcontrary to our freedom.  We must use logic, and reason, and compellingarguments.  To use emotion, and appeal to fear is to lower yourselvesto the level of your enemies.    A side issue...  When talking about the Amendments, it bothersme to see people acting as if they empower them, but require noresponsibility from them.  Free speech also assumes restraint, wellarmed militia expects well TRAINED militia, the right to vote expectsthe citizen to try to become educated enough to make a reasonabledecision.  You are not granted these rights without any responsibilityto the society that offers them.  You have a responsibility in return,and it's to do more than bitch.                                                     --  Morgan Schweers-- Hacker, Furry, SFFan, gamer, writer, MUDder, climber.  24 hours isn't enough!mrs@netcom.com   | Finger mrs@netcom.com or mrs@mcafee.com for my PGP 2.1 key!|New chrome grass! \\ B1 S4 a b g j++! k l? p r- s t+ u v- w+ x y- z, approx.__/Low-level D&D monsters practicing war games @ night.

If the Mormons fortified Utah and armed it to the teeth,>and were involved in illegal activity, then they deserve whatever they get.Actually, after surviving being driven out of Nauvoo, and later Carthage,the Mormons DID fortify Utah.  They still arm themselves to "defend thefaith", and stockpile food as well.  They have been involved in quite alot of illegal activity - including multiple (and often underage) wivesfor the leaders - a practice still in vogue with some splinters of theirsect.  The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking.So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J. Edgar Hoover was veryimpressed with the way they kept secrets.  (They're pledged to defendsecrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood.  Many actuallydo - even to the point of suicide.)  So he hired virtually no one butMormons, until the FBI was almost exclusively staffed by members of theChurch of Later Day Saints.  Though J. Edgar is finally gone, the FBIpersonnel (especially the field agents) are still heavily Mormon.I have often wondered how this might affect the FBI's treatmentof religious organizations a Mormon would consider heretical.-- ==========Michael McClarymcclary@netcom.comFor faster response, address electronic mail to:michael@node.com
 86I wrote :  Nice strawman indeed.  The discussion is not about whether there weretanks  used in sixties riots; instead, it is about whether those tanks firedtheir  main guns in one of those riots.  You claim they did.  That claim is  ludicrous.Awesley replied:     I repeated what I had been told, under what context I had heard it,  supporting the claim that tanks were indeed used in Detroit in 67.The issue has never been whether tanks were used in Detroit in 1967.  Ithas been whether they fired their main guns.  You did not merely claim thattanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppresssniper fire and that they were "quite" effective at this.  You continue toback away from this claim and defend something else that nobody isdisputing.Awesley went on:  I  spent a few minutes in a library today -- found their computer was  down and they don't have a card catalog.  Anyway, it took about 10  minutes to find this in _Nightmare in Detroit, A Rebellion and It's  Victims_ by Sauter and Hines, on page 133, telling of the death of  Tonia Blanding, age 4.           "When the tank was fired upon by snipers it turned in the direction  the shots came from. [...] the fifty-caliber machine gun mounted on the  tank belched fire into the buildings.  After a short round into the front  of the buildings, the tank guns spit again, tearing apart huge holes out  of the side of the apartment."         Well, it's not the main gun.  "Well, it's not the main gun."  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are younow going to admit that you were wrong?I wrote:  will I see any pictures of tanks firing their main  guns?  Will I see pictures of buildings damaged by the shells?  Will Iread  the reports of the tank fire?  I'll bet you dollar to doughnuts I won't.   It will take more than second-hand accounts from a few old National Guard  sergeants shooting the shit to convince me that tanks shelled American  cities in the Sixties.Awesley replied:    Well, if you bothered to read them, it wouldn't take long at all to  find reports of tank * fire * -- although not necessarily of the main  guns.I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken placewithout it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The Americanmilitary firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would havebeen *big* news.Awesley goes on:  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussiongrenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would beperfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, sinceit makes your other claim seem more plausible.And on:  I don't  expect to convince you; you'll have to open your mind and eyes andactually  do a little research to be convinced one way or the other.  Let me know  what you find.I already know what you found: nothing.  If I claimed that the Marines usedF-4s to launch rockets at buildings in Trenton, New Jersey would youbelieve me?  Would you suspend judgment until you had a chance to researchit?  Or would your bullshit filters kick in?If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have beenscreaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know aboutit.  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I preferto live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe thatthose tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.--John L. Scott
 64A few comments on the ATF's botched handling of this case:1. Attempting to storm the compound in broad daylight?  The explanation   we were given (at least at one point) was that they thought the cult   members would be at religious services.  My only comment on this bit   of idiocy is that if you're going to operate as a quasi-military unit,   you'd better understand basic military tactics.  One cardinal rule   is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is   incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously.2. We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were   outgunned, they didn't expect such heavy resistance.  When   questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault   was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were   thought to be heavily armed.  Can you say contradictory?  I knew   you could!3. The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant,   hotdoggers.  I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and   referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes.  I'm   more than ever convinced that's right on target.  An anecdote not   related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up   some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing.  There's   now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by   the FBI will not be admissible in court.  This is not hearsay.  I   was told this by a relative of my wife's who happens to be an FBI   agent.  His opinion of the BATF was, ummm, well, let's just say   uncomplimentary.4. I have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that   the BD's had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the   reason for the raid in the first place.  BTW, we're *still* hearing   this justification.  AG Reno, on CNN yesterday, made references   to this issue, without any substantiation.  She also waved around   the "He's a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children!"   flag.  Sigh.5. A point re the Feds in general: their handling of the whole siege   reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought   processes of the cultists.  AG Reno said they pushed the button   because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing.  My   only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to   the edge, what the hell did she think their reaction would be to   an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in   the walls and CS gas pumped in?  If I were a BD, I'd expect the   forces of the godless government to assault me at any time.  In   that light, whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones   Kool-Aid is irrelevant.  Also, look at how the siege was conducted:   Bright lights, loud rock music, cutting off communications and   other contact with the outside.  All measures designed to make the   BD's feel more and more isolated and threatened.  This might have   been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals.  As it   was, it looks to me like everything they did fed into Koresh's   paranoid delusions.-- #include <std_disclaimer.h>Dan S.

On thismorning's news, there was an item about the BATF warrant being unsealed.That they bought $200,000 worth of LEGAL weapons has not been denied byanyone.  When they were accused of harming others in the past, the localsherriff had no problems in serving a warrant; our rights as free peoplewere violated by the BATF going in shooting.  This country was founded on the superiority of the rights of the individual.Remember Pastor Niemoller's remarks.-- Herman Rubin, Dept. of Statistics, Purdue Univ., West Lafayette IN47907-1399Phone: (317)494-6054hrubin@snap.stat.purdue.edu (Internet, bitnet)  {purdue,pur-ee}!snap.stat!hrubin(UUCP)
