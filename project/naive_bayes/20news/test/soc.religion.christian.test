I'm curious to know what purpose people think these lists serve.Lists like this seem to value quantity over quality, an "argumentfrom article length."  And the list you have here is of poorerquality than most.  Since the quotes seem to be taken from anon-line bible, I doubt that there will be much problem withverses quoted inaccurately.  But that isn't the problem here.I've known a lot of fundamentalists in my life, but none whodenied that there were errors in transmission, etc.  And many ofthe contradictions here -- Solomon having 40,000 horse stalls inone verse, and 4,000 in another -- are just the sort ofcontradiction that fundies don't have a problem with, in myexperience.  So how do these sorts of contradictions amount toanything more than attacking a straw man?Some of the others are just silly, or rely on taking quotes outof context, or have reasonable explanations.  But even the onesthat are genuine contradictions need to have more said aboutthem than what is given here.  (At the very least, some effortshould be made to understand and respond to the common repliesgiven by fundies.)  Look for example at the research that DaveButler put into an article examining a false prophecy about Tyre.That would be an excellent start for an anti-inerrancy list thatwould have some teeth.  (One well-researched and documentedcontradiction is worth more than one hundred quotes taken outof context and thrown together in a list.)Lists like this that just toss a bunch of quotes together tomake a bible verse salad just don't cut it.  Those of us whowant to argue against inerrancy should find this sort of thingas embarassing as the fundies should find Josh McDowell.djP.S. You can find some good material at ftp.rutgers.edu in/pub/soc.religion.christian/others/contradictions.  The qualityis very uneven on both sides of the argument (it is just acompilation of things many people have written), but some ofit would be useful in an anti-inerrancy FAQ.  After exams, Imight be willing to help put it together.

Why do atheists organize in groups?  What is there to discuss?Response:Many things are discussed here, including:* Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one's  family* Prayer in schools* Discrimination against atheists* Sunday trading laws* The Satanic Child Abuse myth* Whether one should be an overt atheist or 'stay in the closet'* How religious societies prey (sic) on new college students* How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers* Whether religion is a danger to society and/or the individual* Why people become atheistsOf course, inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical Christianslooking for someone to convert.  Most readers of the newsgroup don't want to be preached to, although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure from tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings.------------------------------Subject: Hitler was an atheist!Typical posting:Hitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!Response:Adolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist.  As he said himself:   The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in   his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_   superficially_of_God's_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God's_will,_and_   not_let_God's_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]   For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their   abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the   Lord's creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be   active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every   man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who   in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his   religious community and tries to butt into the other.   [...]   Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will   of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_   fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]          -- Adolf Hitler, from "Mein Kampf", trans. Ralph Mannheim.Of course, someone bad believing something does not make that beliefwrong.  It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed to believe in God.  We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist, though.------------------------------Subject: The Bible proves itTypical posting:In the Bible it says that...Response:Most of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionableaccuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who wererecording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn't to say that TheBible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before beingaccepted.Many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage issubject to "interpretation", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing andone thing only is not legitimate.Note that this feeling tends to extend to other books.It is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore otherequally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.------------------------------Subject: Pascal's WagerTypical posting:If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --but if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go tohell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.Response:This argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.Firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there aremany mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is oftendescribed as the "avoiding the wrong hell" problem.  If a person is afollower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.Secondly, the statement that "If you believe in God and turn out to beincorrect, you have lost nothing" is not true.  Suppose you're believing inthe wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine infavour of prayer.Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of comparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly theargument is only likely to convince those who believe already.Also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on evidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or cost-benefit analysis.Formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:  1. One does not know whether God exists.  2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does     exist.  3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.  4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.There are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as anassumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, inthe abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This isconsidered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has noinformation about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial informationcan be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violatesinformation entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, atno "cost".The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  Theproblem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states theChristian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. Theargument thus collapses to "If you are a Christian, it is in your intereststo believe in God" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascalintended the argument to be viewed.The biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God isomniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes asa wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at allwhether people believe in him.------------------------------Subject: What is Occam's Razor?Typical posting:People keep talking about Occam's Razor.  What is it?Response:William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's Razor.  In its original form, it said "Do not multiply entities unnecessarily."  That is, if you can explain something without supposingthe existence of some entity, then do so.Nowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor, they generally express it more generally, for example as "Take the simplest solution".The relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations for what we see around us:1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, whichcame into being as a result of natural processes.2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and there is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be of non-zero complexity.Given that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.Unfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:3. There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.  We just imagine that there is.This third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people find unacceptable. ------------------------------Subject: Why it's good to believe in JesusTypical posting:I want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.Response:Preaching is not appreciated.Feel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings thatare on a "conversion" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism andwill be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgrouptalk.religion.misc).You would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favouritenewsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you wouldhave them do unto you!Often theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthyanalogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know thebasic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tellatheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it,since it tells us nothing we have not been told before.------------------------------Subject: Why I know that God existsTypical posting:I *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.Response:Just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worshipexists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do notexist.  That evidence varies from person to person.Furthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, manypeople have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have beenabducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.------------------------------Subject: Einstein and "God does not play dice"Typical posting:Albert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you're cleverer than him?Response:Einstein did once comment that "God does not play dice [with the universe]". This quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in theChristian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein'srefusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore,Einstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.A better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following:"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony ofwhat exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions ofhuman beings."Einstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in anobjective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to randomevents and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed thatQM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need forstatistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found,and much evidence suggests that it never will be.A longer quote from Einstein appears in "Science, Philosophy, and Religion, ASymposium", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religionin Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  Init he says:  "The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events   the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side   of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him   neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an   independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a   personal God interfering with natural events could never be   *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this   doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific   knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.   But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives   of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine   which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,   will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm   to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers   of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal   God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past   placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they   will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable   of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity   itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably   more worthy task..."Einstein has also said:  "It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,   a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a   personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.   If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the   unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our   science can reveal it."The latter quote is from "Albert Einstein: The Human Side", edited by Helen Dukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.  Also from the same book:  "I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics   to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind    it."Of course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does not in itself imply that Christianity is false.------------------------------Subject: Everyone worships somethingTypical posting:Everyone worships something, whether it's money, power or God.Response:If that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much aboutthose things that atheists care about.  If the atheists' reactions to (forexample) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.------------------------------Subject: Why there must be a causeless causeTypical posting:Sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, sochains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.Response:The set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but hasno smallest member.Further, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that doesnot imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, andespecially not that any such entity must match the description favoured byany particular religion.------------------------------Subject: The universe is so complex it must have been designedTypical posting:The presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely youdon't think all this appeared here just by chance?Response:This is known as the Argument From Design.It is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in theuniverse. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of livingcreatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read thenewsgroup talk.origins for a while.There is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here.However, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour ofso-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence,observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of theuniverse and life on earth.The origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence ofsomething as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable thatsurely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaosdeliberately.But if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mindcapable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings mustbe immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of theexistence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationistposition.This leads us to the familiar theme of "If a creator created the universe,what created the creator?", but with the addition of spiralling improbability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was notcreated and just "is" (or "was").From here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universejust "is" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book"A Brief History of Time", explains his theory that the universe is closedand finite in extent, with no beginning or end.The Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called Watchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch onthe beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that itevolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the watch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the universe too must have a creator.The Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above those common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates watches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have created the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are clearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.Secondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in the world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear reactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument would therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a different part of creation.Finally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore stands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the argument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not random, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus internally inconsistent.------------------------------Subject: Independent evidence that the Bible is trueTypical posting:The events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentaryevidence.  For example...Response:The writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentaryevidence.Early versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus orJames; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Manyscholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, butthat this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several "reconstructions" ofthe original text have been published to this effect.Much information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320C.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberatefalsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'thefirst thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' It is Eusebius who isgenerally given the title of authorship for this material.Aside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus ismore well-documented.  For further information, please consult the FrequentlyAsked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.------------------------------Subject: Godel's Incompleteness TheoremTypical posting:Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for theBible to be both true and complete.Response:Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary arithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be valid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system.  (Technicallyspeaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decisionprocedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal system.)Essentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a "Liar Paradox."  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is "This sentence is false."  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.The logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claimsthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible toprove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.One can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove theexistence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom. This is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.It may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axiomsthat both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to showthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, thatwould still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God existswithin the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything aboutwhether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.Note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing aboutthe actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.Another frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstratesthat a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot beboth consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formalsystems, so such claims are nonsense.------------------------------Subject: George Bush on atheism and patriotismTypical posting:Did George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?Response:The following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I.Sherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Shermanis a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member ofthe press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announcefederal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to thepresidential primary: RS: "What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?" GB: "I guess I'm pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in      God is important to me." RS: "Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of      Americans who are atheists?" GB: "No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens,      nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under      God." RS: "Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation      of state and church?" GB: "Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I'm just not      very high on atheists."UPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations werestill angry over the remarks.The exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27,1989.  It can also be found in "Free Enquiry" magazine, Fall 1988 issue,Volume 8, Number 4, page 16.On October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane,cochairman of the Bush-Quayle '88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned alawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated SchoolDistrict 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son topledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as "one nation under God"(Bush's phrase).  The following conversation took place:  RS: "American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.      Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?"  EM: "It's bullshit."  RS: "What is bullshit?"  EM: "Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit."  RS: "Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush      campaign is on this issue." EM: "You're welcome."After Bush's election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retracthis statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to thePresident, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood byhis original statement, and wrote:  "As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports   atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or   supported by the government."For further information, contact American Atheist Veterans at the AmericanAtheist Press's Cameron Road address.------------------------------Subject: I know where hell is!Typical posting:I know where Hell is!  Hell is in Norway!Response:There are several towns called "Hell" in various countries around theworld, including Norway and the USA.  Whilst this information is mildlyamusing the first time one hears it, readers of alt.atheism are now getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.------------------------------Subject: Biblical contradictions wantedTypical posting:Does anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions?Response: American Atheist Press publish an atheist's handbook detailing Biblicalcontradictions. See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources fordetails.There is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from thearchive-server@mantis.co.uk. See the contacts file for more information.------------------------------Subject: The USA is a Christian nationTypical posting:Because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn't theUnited States be considered a Christian nation?Response:Based upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clearthat they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.  Here are somequotes; there are many more.  "What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?   In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the   ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen   upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been   the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert   the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient   auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it,   needs them not."      - James Madison, "A Memorial and Remonstrance", 1785  "I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of   the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved--the Cross.   Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!"      - John Adams, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson  "History I believe furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people   maintaining a free civil government.  This marks the lowest grade of   ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will   always avail themselves for their own purpose."      - Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt, 1813  "I cannot conceive otherwise than that He, the Infinite Father, expects or   requires no worship or praise from us, but that He is even infinitely   above it."      - Benjamin Franklin, from "Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion",        Nov. 20, 1728------------------------------Subject: The USA is not a Christian nationTypical posting:Is it true that George Washington said that the United States is not in anysense founded upon the Christian religion?Response:No.  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treatyof Tripoli (8 Stat 154, Treaty Series 358):   Article 11   As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense   founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of   enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, -- and as   the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility   against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no   pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption   of the harmony existing between the two countries.The text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collectionssuch as Charles Bevans' "Treaties and Other International Agreements of theUnited States of America 1776-1949", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).The English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate onJune 7, 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  It wasrecently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks thequotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.The person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, ConsulGeneral at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent ofChristianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since thereis no Arabic version of that article to be found, it's hard to say.In 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained thequotation.End of FAQ Digest*****************

I know>that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds, yet>hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless, saying' You fools,>do you still think that just believing is enough?'Actually I don't think there is any conflict if we really understandwhat these passages say.  First, what is faith?  If you study the meaning of the Greek and Hebrew words so translated I think you willcome to the conclusion that the word means a *lot* more than mere belief.  Faith means both trust and action.  If you do not put your belief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith.  I think this is what James means when he says that "faith without works is dead" and, "I will show you my faith by my works."  Remember James was writing to "the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad."  This probably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much later and wouldn't understand the meaning of the original Greek.(Indeed I suspect James was writing to us, today, among others heintended to reach.)  Paul, on the other hand wrote mostly to thepeople of the Roman empire who generally understood the meaning ofthe Greek.Another key to why there is no conflict is to look at Paul'sstatements in their context.  I think you will find that when Paulcontrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing thegospel with the Law, meaning the Law of Moses.  This was the greatburden of Paul's life.  As the apostle to the Gentiles he would goconvert a bunch of people, then the "Judizers" would come along andtry to convince them that they also had to obey the Law of Moses (cfActs chapter 15).  In this context Paul condemns the idea of beingsaved by the works of the Law, saying that we are saved by the bloodof Jesus and our faith in him.  I believe that a better translationfor today would be that we are saved by *faithfulness*.  I think"faithfulness" today has a meaning closer to what the originalwriters intended.>Now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves>and not by God, according to Romans that person is still saved by there faith.I think you misunderstand Romans.  What Paul is really saying isthat God prefers a faithful Gentile who does not "keep kosher" to akosher Jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important mattersof following the Lord and having charity toward his fellows.>But then there is the bit which says that God preferes someone who is cold to>him (i.e. doesn't know him - condemned) so a lukewarm Christian someone who>knows and believes in God but doesn't make any attempt to live by the bible.In the sense of faith described above, you cannot have real faith and be lukewarm.  If you know God but are lukewarm (unfaithful), you are worse off than the person who never heard of Him.  Remember, Jesus inthe parable of the pearl of great price (Mat 13:45-46) and again inthe one on the treasure hidden in the field (Mat 13:44) indicates thatthe price of the Kingdom of God is *all* we have.[I agree with you in general, including the fact that "pistis" hassome of the force of "faithful".  However if you take that too far,you can end up with something that Paul definitely would not haveintended.  Being faithful means following God in all things.  To saythat we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that weare saved by commiting no sins.  I assume that's not what you meant.I have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula thatcompletely captures this.  However I think Paul is describing what I'dcall a basic orientation, including aspects such as trust andcommitment.  Jesus speaks of it as rebirth, which implies a basicchange.  We may still do things that are sinful, and may fail to showthe new life in Christ in many situations where we should.  But in anyChristian there had better be the basic change in orientation thatJesus calls being born again.--clh]

Maybe clh may wish to provide the first response.There is a lot of talk about the Sabbath of the TC being ceremonial. Answer this:Since the TC commandments is one law with ten parts on what biblicalbasis have you decided that only the Sabbath portion is ceremonial?OR You say that the seventh-day is the Sabbath but not applicable toGentile Christians.  Does that mean the Sabbath commandment has beenannulled?  References please.If God did not intend His requirements on the Jews to be applicable toGentile Christians why did He make it plain that the Gentiles were nowgrafted into the commonwealth of Israel?Darius[Acts 15, Rom 14:5, Col 2:16, Gal 4:10.

Maintaining a `just friends' level of relationship is much easier said than done.  People usually end up getting hurt.  This is especially likely to happen when they start off with feelings of attraction.  When people feel attracted those feelings can cloud their judgement.  I've had the experience of going quickly from believing that I shouldn't date non-Christians to believing that dating this man would be okay to believing that premarital sex is fine when people really love each other.  When the relationship ended my beliefs immediately returned to their original state.  This is an especially extreme case because I was young and away from home and fellowship.  I don't think it would work exactly this way for most people.  However, it's important not to underestimate the power of feelings of attraction.  Jayne Kulikauskas/ jayne@mmalt.guild.org

The people before Jesus didn't have Jesus, right (so far, I'veannounced that space is a vacuum)?  The people who lived during the timeJesus lived (especially disciples) were taught this:  "I tell you thetruth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing.  Hewill do even greater things than these, because I am going to theFather.  And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son maybring glory to the Father.  You may ask me for anything in my name, andI will do it." (John 14:12-14)So, Jesus asked them to pray for things in his name.  Since that time,the request has been the same, not to ask for intercession from otherbeings, but from Jesus.  Remember that "there is one God and onemediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself asa ransom for all men--the testimony given in its proper time." (1Timothy 2:5-6.  Also, "there have been many of those priests [talkingabout priests among the Hebrews], since death prevented them fromcontinuing in office; but because Jesus lives forever, he has apermanent priesthood.  Therefore he is able to save completely those whocome to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them."(Hebrews 7:23-25).  Hebrews is also full of areas talking about Jesusbeing our mediator rather than any other man.Joe Fisher["The people before Jesus didn't have Jesus, right" may not be asobvious as you think.  In what sense to you mean didn't have?Christian thought has generally said that they had Jesus in the sensethat they were saved by his death.  God is not bound by ourchronology.  So in some real spiritual sense they did "have Jesus".Even in terms of knowledge, while they surely didn't have the explicitknowledge that we have, Christians have normally seen messianicprophecy as knowledge of Jesus, even if knowledge from afar.--clh]

No one can browbeat youinto believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in drivingyou further away.  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions:1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attainit.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain thissalvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certainmodern offshoots like the "new age movement" teach or does he require God'shelp?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can suchhelp come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and forsome people it did comprise their life's writings, so I am hardly in aposition to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.  Few,of us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives (certainly not me).The spritual life is a difficult journey (if you've never read "A Pilgrim'sProgress," I highly recommend this greatest allegory of the english language).>Peace and Love>In God(ess)'s name>James MossNow I see by your close that one possible source of trouble for you may be aconflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing.  Youwrote that "I (in my own faith) accept and live my life by many if not mostof the teachings of christ".  Well, Christ referred to God as "My Father",not "My Mother", and while the "maleness" of God is not the same as themaleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does nothonor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory,or politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intentto do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women - english just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).  After all, Godchose a woman as his only human partner in bringing Christ into the humanpopulation.Well, I'm not about to launch into a detailed discussion ofthe role of women in Christianity at 1am with only 6 hours of sleep in thelast 63, and for that reason I also apologize for any shortcomings in thisarticle.  I just happened across yours and felt moved to reply.  I hope Imay have given you, and anyone else who finds himself in a similar frame ofmind, something to contemplate.Karl Dussik

(And there are plenty of other examples.)>Can you reconcile this?The problem you see here is that some Christians claim things aboutthe Bible which they don't actually believe or practice. I've knownall sorts of Christians, ranging from the trendiest of liberals tothe fire-breathing fundamentalists, and although many on the conservative side of the Christian faith do claim that the Bible isa (perhaps *the*) source of absolute truth, I don't know of anyonewho treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition.While I am not a Roman Catholic, I believe this is close to the officialposition of the RC church (perhaps an RC would like to comment).The particular practice you refer to will usually be explained interms of the social context of the time. You would think the fact that the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophat-and-cane and give you some big song-and-dance routine about why this (other passages as well) aren't directly applicable today would show them that what they claim about the Bible and what they actually practice are two different things, but mostly it doens't.While this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of Christians,I would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy, in thiscase, making claims about the Bible which the claimants don't actuallyput into practice. But if we step back from the name-calling andlook at what people are attempting to say, we see that they are tryingto express very concisely the unique place the Bible holds within theChristian faith. So when people use such words or phrases as "Word ofGod", "inerrant", "infallibale", "The Manufacturer's Handbook", "Theonly rule of faith and practice in the church today" to describe theBible, we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look atthe mere words they use. Some of the above descriptions are demostratablyfalse and others are self-contradictory, but in my experience people aregenerally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker evenwhen the speaker's words are at variance with their intentions. A Biblicalexample is from the garden of Eden where God asks "Where are you?" and Adamexplains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself. If Adam hadanswered God's words he would have said something like "I'm here in thistree." The problem seems to arise when Christians insist that thesewords are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif. Most peoplehave not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding ofthe place of the Bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrasesand explanations that others use.I hope this helps.--                                                                     ___Bill Rea                                                            (o o)-------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---| Bill Rea, Computer Services Centre, | E-Mail   b.rea@csc.canterbury.ac.nz || University of Canterbury,           | or     cctr114@csc.canterbury.ac.nz || Christchurch, New Zealand           | Phone (03)-642-331 Fax (03)-642-999 |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Luke's prolog isabout the only thing we have from the author describing his process.The prolog sounds like Luke is from the next generation, and had to dosome investigating.  There are traditions passed down verbally thatsay a few things about the composition of the Gospels.  There aredebates about how reliable these traditions are.  They certainly don'thave the status of Scripture, yet scholars tend to take some of themseriously.  One suggests that Mark was based on Peter's sermons, andwas written to preserve them when Peter had died or way about to die.One tradition about Matthew suggests that a collection of Jesus wordsmay have been made earlier than the current Gospels.  In the ancient world, it was much more common to rely on verbaltransmission of information.  I think many people would have preferredto hear about Jesus directly from someone who had known him, and maybeeven from someone who studied directly under such a person, ratherthan from a book.  Thus I suspect that the Gospels are largely from aperiod when these people were beginning to die.  Scholars generally dothink there was some written material earlier, which was probably usedas sources for the existing Gospels.Establishing the dates is a complex and technical business.  I have toconfess that I'm not sure how much reliance I'd put on the methodsused.  But it's common to think that Mark was written first, around 64AD., and that all of the Gospels were written by the end of theCentury.  A few people vary this by a decade or so one way or theother.--clh]

The part I quote above seems to me to indicatedisapproval of capital punishment - it is to be used only whenother means are not sufficient; I would say this is a strongerrestriction than saying that capital punishment is useable whenjustifiable. I would certainly say there are cases where acrime justifies death (perhaps this is the Old Testamentinterpretation), but my reverence for life would say that Iwould oppose the actual infliction of the death penalty (a NewTestament interpretation?). It is a matter for debate whetherthe death penalty works to keep the peace in a way thatnon-violent provisions do not. I don't believe it does, and Iwould certainly observe that in the USA, where you have thedeath penalty, there is a far higher murder rate than here inthe UK, where we do not.Matthew Huntbach

The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because they are not quoted by the NT authors.That is not quite accurate.  Otherwise we would have the bookof Enoch in the canon (as Dave noted).  One can say that the apocrypha are not quoted by Christ.  Dave also writes:III. The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because they teach doctrines contrary to the (uncontroverted) parts of the canon.  then I answer:  These is a logically invalid *a priori*.  Besides, we are talking about OT texts-  which in many parts are superceded by the NT (in the Xtian view). Would not this same principle exclude _Ecclesiastes_? This principle cannot be consistently applied. I have to reject your argument here.  The Spirit speaks with onevoice, and he does not contradict himself.  The ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspiredby the Spirit, i.e., God-breathed.  It is a test which is moreguided by faith than by reason or logic.  The early church decidedthat the Apocrypha did not meet this test--even though some bookssuch as The Wisdom of Ben Sirach have their uses.  For example,the Lutheran hymn "Now Thank We All Our God" quotes a passagefrom this book.The deutero-canonical books were added much later in the church'shistory.  They do not have the same spiritual quality as therest of Scripture.  I do not believe the church that added thesebooks was guided by the Spirit in so doing.  And that is wherethis sort of discussion ultimately ends.David H.

We know that early Christianssuffered totures because of their witness to Christ.  For example:ACT 5:40    His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had            them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of            Jesus, and let them go.ACT 5:41    The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been            counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name.It appears that the Jewish rulers of that time had a particular aversionto even hearing Jesus's name.ACT 5:28    "We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name," he said.            "Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are            determined to make us guilty of this man's blood."Finally, the first apostle's death, James of Zebedee was certainlynot by Rome's hand any more than the first martyr Stephen. >The idea of resurrection is one which can be found in a host of different>forms in the religions of antiquity.

What I mean is that our culture is such that we tend towards satisfying our own wants ratherthan considering things with others in mind and not making prayer an initial and primary part of the decision process. People tend totreat church as they would a club and when something is less than totheir liking, off they go to another one.I think that scripture presents the idea that God takes a different perspective on the "church choosing process". It seems to me from 1Cor 12that God doesn't subscribe to the idea of us choosing a church at allbut that he places us in the body as he wants us. So, I think a betterquestion is not how do I choose a church but how do I figure out whereGod is trying to place me.If a person was instrumental in leading you to Christ, the church theygo to is a logical first choice. You have been born into the family ofGod. People should hop around from church to church as often as theyhop from natural family to family.If you met the Lord on your own (so to speak) there may not be an easily identifiable church to try for starters. Here you are morelike an orphan. Prayerfully go and "leave yourself on a few doorsteps"and see if anyplace feels like home. I wouldn't expect that God want to place you in a church where youhave difficulty fitting in with the people, but on the other handthere are no perfect churches. If you have an attitude of lookingfor problems you will both find them and make them. On the other handif you have an attitude of love and committment, you will spread thatwherever you go. In general, I think that God will try to place you in a church thattalks about the Lord in the way that you have come to know him and isexpanding on that base.-- Peter Whitedisclaimer: None of what is written necessarily reflects      a view of my company.Phil    I want to know Christ and the power of his3:10 resurrection and the fellowship of sharing inNIVhis sufferings, becoming like him in his death

What I'm trying to point out is that, in matters of faith(i.e. tenets which are not logically persuasive), one may be convincedof the truth of certain things through, for instance, personalrevelation.  And its certainly fine to share that revelation or thosebeliefs with others.  And I don't think that its arrogant, persay, toaccepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself.  Where I think theconflict arises is in assuming that, where disagreements on beliefsarise, all others *must* have been given the same truth, and that God must reveal His truth to everyone in such a way that all would honestly agree.  I think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest; that they are rejecting something they *know* to be truth because it is inconvenient for them, or because they wish to spurn God.I would say that this is equivalent to assuming that *all* truths one holds are universal and absolute.  And the problem I see with this is that it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships withGod.  This does not mean there is no absolute truth; just that some areasof doctrinal disagreement may be areas where God has not established or revealed that truth.  -- comments, criticism welcome...-Kenalvin@ucsu.colorado.edu[I agree with you.  --clh]

Itgrew up in reaction to Nestorianism, which held that the Son and Jesusare two different people who happened to be united in the same bodytemporarily.  Monophysitism is held by the Copts of Egypt and Ethipoiaand by the Jacobites of Syria and the Armenian Orthodox.  It believesthat Jesus Christ was God (which is correct), that he was man (which iscorrect), that he was one person (which is correct), but that he hadonly one nature and one will and oen energy (which is heretical, theorthodox position is that he had two natures and two wills and twoenergies, both divine and human, though the wills were in perfectharmony).  That is what Mike is trying to get across, that while Jesuscame in human form, Mike says He did not have a human nature or a humanwill.  In reality, he had both, though neither made him subject tooriginal sin.It is interesting to note that the Monothelites were a reaction to thisconflict and attempted to solve the problem by admitting two natures butnot two wills or two energies.  It also was condemned, at a late councilin Constantinople I believe.Andy Byler[These issues get mighty subtle.  When you see people saying differentthings it's often hard to tell whether they really mean seriouslydifferent things, or whether they are using different terminology.  Idon't think there's any question that there is a problem withNestorius, and I would agree that the saying Christ had a human formwithout a real human nature or will is heretical.  But I'd like to bea bit wary about the Copts, Armenians, etc.  Recent discussionssuggest that their monophysite position may not be as far fromorthodoxy as many had thought.  Nestorius was an extremerepresentative of one of the two major schools of thought.  Moremoderate representatives were regarded as orthodox, e.g. Theodore ofMopsuestia.  My impression is that the modern monophysite groupsinherit the entire tradition, not just Nestorius' version, and thatsome of them may have a sufficient balanced position to be regarded asorthodox.  --clh]

Ifthe crucification was the will of God how could Jesus pray that thiscup pass from him.  Was this out of weakness.  NEVER.  Many men andwomen have given their lives for their country or other noble causes.Is Jesus less than these.  No he is not.  He knew the crucificationwas NOT the will of GOD.  God's will was that the Jewish people acceptJesus as the Messiah and that the kingdom of Heaven be established onthe earth with Jesus as it's head. (Just like the Jewish peopleexpected). If this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine whatkind of world we would live in today.  It would be a very differentworld.  And that is eactly what GOD wanted.  Men and women of that agecould have been saved by following the living Messiah while he was onthe earth.  Jesus could have established a sinless lineage that wouldhave continued his reign after his ascension to the spiritual world tolive with GOD.  Now the kingdom of heaven on the earth will have towait for Christ's return.  But when he returns will he be recognizedand will he find faith on this earth.  Isn't it about time for hisreturn.

Is the person's childhood takeninto account?I'm sure these must sound like over-simplifications tomost of you, but I figure that you're the experts.-Quinn[Eschatology is an area on which Christians do not agree.  I suspectthat's because our primary source of information is prophets andvisionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic.  Howeverboth Jesus' teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelationto John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life andeternal death.  On a number of occasions Jesus does say things thatimply some sort of differentiation, e.g. Lk 10:14 and a number ofsimilar passages where Jesus says things like "even XXX will be betteroff than you in the judgement."  Also, I Cor 3 talks about someone whogets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were.  But thesepassages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens,so much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven orhell (and not all Christians would even go as far as that).  The onlyChristian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is theMormons, and they are very far from mainstream Christianity (farenough that many of our readers would not call them Christian).  Theirideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations, in additionto the Bible and "Holy Tradition" of a more generic Christian sort.Note that many Christians will cringe at the very thought ofassociating grading with God.  The whole point of Christ was to freeus from the results of a test that we couldn't possibly pass.  If youlike test analogies, God grades on a very strict and unbending scale,but he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam thatwas prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading.Because some people end up in heaven and others in hell, it's easy tosee why you'd be inclined to think of it as grading.  While there aredifferences among branches of Christianity on details, I think we allagree that in one way or another, God cheats.I am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactlyhow far God's cheating extends.  Will he accept people who don'texplicitly acknowledge Christ, but somehow still follow him in theirhearts?  Many Christians believe that this is possible, at least inprinciple, but certainly not all do.  Jesus provided us with a cleardescription of how to be saved, but it's not clear to me that heprovided an exact description of how he's going to place the dividingline.  Certainly he made it clear that we can't expect to know whetherother individuals are saved or not.--clh]

Suppose that thatchapter had been written with the sexes reversed. We have Godcreating woman, and then saying, "It is not good that woman shouldbe alone. I will make a help meet for her." Feminists would beoutraged. The clear implication would be that God had started at thebottom and worked up, making first the plants, then the fish andbirds, then the beasts, then woman, and finally His masterpiece, theMale Chauvinist Pig. The statement that woman is not capable offunctioning by herself, that she needs a man to open doors for her,would have been seen as a particularly gratuitous insult. The factthat the creation of woman from the dust of the ground was givenonly briefly and in general, while the creation of the Man was givenin six times the number of words, would have been cited as evidenceof the author's estimate of the relative importance of the sexes.The verdict would have been unequivocal. "No self-respecting womancan accept this book as a moral guide, or as anything but sexisttrash!" I suggest that Moses, fearing this reaction, altered hisoriginal draft and described the creation with Adam first and thenEve, so as to appease Miriam and other radical feminists of the day.For some reason, however, it did not work.

However, the study I did I intend to publish (Iam in the process of organizing and showing the fulfillments, then Iwill be ready to write and send it to a publisher).  With any luck(and/or free time) I should have it finally done sometime aroundSeptember (I hope).Joe Fisher

The point is that God understands the sufferingwe go through, not just intellectually like when we watchthe Somalians on TV, but _really_ understands, He can "feel" our pain. This fact is manifested by Jesus' life. We can arguethat someone in history might have suffered more than Jesus,we can think of more horrible torture than crucifixion, we canthink of cases of betrayal and fruitless effort leading toworse despair, but the main point is that Jesus is in thetrenches with us, He is in everyone, whatever I do to the leastof humanity I do to Him, and whatever I do for the least ofhumanity I do for Him.Now, to reconcile this with the existence of hell is beyond mycapabilities, but that wasn't my goal.> I'd be surprised to see the moderator let this one through, Thankfully our moderator is surprising.> but I seriously want a reasonable explanation for this.As I re-read this I must admit that this is more of a descriptionof my faith than an explanation, but perhaps that's allI can do, hopefully that's all I have to do.Chris Mussack

So what distinguishes, for example, the>Branch Davidian "cult" from the Presbyterian "church"?  Doctrinal>differences don't answer the question, IMHO, so don't use them as>an answer.As far as I can see, one of the big differences between Davidians andChristians is in who they follow.  I have sometimes tried to put myselfin the feet of one of Jesus's disciples.  Basically, they gave up alot --- career, possibly family, and well, a whole bunch, to followJesus.So what is the difference?  It is quite plain.  Jesus was good andDavid Koresh was not.The problem is, I think, is that we try to legislate what is goodand what is bad in terms of principles.  For instance, there are thousands of laws in the U.S. governing what is legal and what is not.  Often, it is hardto bring people to justice, because it is not possible to finda legal way to do it.  If only we could trust judges to be just,then we could tell them to administer justice fairly, and justicewould be followed.  But since judges don't always get it right,we have a complicated system involving precedent and bunchesof other stuff which attempt to make the imperfect (the justiceof man) into something perfect.  But what I hear about the justicesystem in the U.S. tells me that quite the opposite is true.There is also a problem that we tend to judge the presentationmore than the material being presented.  So we might consider a ranting Christian to be bad, but an eloquent person from anotherreligion to be good.  This goes along with the American desireto protect the Constitution at all costs, even if it allowspeople to do bad things. I think that it is the message that is important.  If a man ispresenting a false message, even if he is ever ever so mild mannered,then that man is performing a tremendous disservice.I know that I am rambling here.  I guess that what I am trying tosay is that we shouldn't be looking for principles that tell uswhy the Davidians got it wrong.  It is not wrong to follow andworship a person.  But it is important to choose the right person.It is simple.  Choose Jesus, and you got it right.  Chooseanyone else, and you got it wrong.  Why?  Because Jesus is thebegotten son of God, and nobody else is.  Jesus was without sin, andnobody else was.Stephen

I am not posting here as an immature flamestart, but rather to express an opinion to my intended audience.The meaning of my existence is a question I ask myself daily.  I live in fear of what will happen when I  die.   I bet some of you are licking your lips now, because you think thatI'm a person on the edge of accepting jeezus.             I was raised in a religious atmosphere, and attended 13 years ofreligious educational institutions..  I know the bible well. So wellI can recognize many passages from memory.  <<****Strong opinions start here...****>>1) The human being is an _animal_ who has, due to his/her advancedmental facilities, developed religious as a satisfiable solution toexplain the unexplainable.  (For example the ancient Greeks believedthat Apollo drove his chariot across the sky each day was real.  Dueto the advancement of our technology, we know this to be false.  Christianity is an infectious cult.  The reasons it flourishes are because 1) it gives people without hope or driven purpose in lifea safety blanked to hide behind.  "Oh wow..all i have to do is follow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness."For all of you "found jeezus" , how many of you were "on the brink?"but i digress...   The other reason christianity flourishes is itsinfectious nature.  A best friend of mine breifly entered a christiangroup and within months, they set ministry guidelines for him whichbasicaly said this -->Priority #1 Spread the Word.We are _just_ animals.  We need sleep, food, and we reproduce.  And wedie.      Religion (especially Christianity) is nothing more than a DRUG.Some people use drugs as an escape from reality.  Christians injectthemselves with jeezus and live with that high. It pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religiouswars, of which Christianity has had no small part.When Christians see a "non-believer", they say that person is blindto the truth, but they cannot realize that it is _they_ who livewith this mask of fakeness each day.  Jesus was just prophet #37696 who happened to have a large influence because at that time the Romanswere (circa 69ad) dispersing the Jewish population and communitiesneeded some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that timeof dire need.I must go.  These are but a few of my thoughts on Christianity.-- //Damien Endemyr the Unpure Knight of Doom                          ////"So I've acquired a taste for blood and have adopted a nocturnal  ////lifestyle.

The non-falsifiability trick.  Howcan I prove it when not all the evidence may be seen?  Answer:  Ican't.  The fallacy is in assuming that it is up to me to prove anything.  When I say it has never been proven, I'm talking about the onesmaking the claims, not the skeptics, who are doing the proving.The burden of proof rest with the claimant.  Unfortunately, (pontification warning) our legal system seems to be headed inthe dangerous realm of making people prove their innocence (endpontification).But truthfully, Corinthians was so poorly written (or maybe justso poorly translated into English) that much remains unknownabout just what Paul really intended (despite claims of hardproof one way or another).  Some will see his writings in1 cor 12-14 as saying don't do this don't do this and usingsarcasm, metaphor, etc. while yet others take what he says literallysarcasms and metaphors notwithstanding.Me?  When I read 1 Cor 14 about praying/speaking in tongues regardingbuilding oneself/the church, I see him using compare/contrast,saying do this because it build the church, while doing thisbuilds onself (implying don't do that).  It's a common usageof writing that we all employ, and it is easily seen how itCOULD be interpreted this way.  Why some do and some don't isa mystery.

This argument is basedon Paul's letters, Acts, and in a more general sense, Jesus'teachings.  Further, most people argue that Scripture shows worshipoccuring on Sunday, and Paul endorsing it.  I understand that thesepoints are disputed, and do not want to go around the dispute one moretime.  The point I'm making here is not that these arguments areright, but that the backing they claim is Scripture.Accepting the principle of "sola scriptura" does not commit us toobeying the entire Jewish Law.  Acts 15 and Paul's letters are quiteclear on that.  I think even the SDA's accept it.  The disagreement ison where the Bible would have us place the line.By the way, Protestants do give authority to the church, in mattersthat are not dictated by God.  That's why churches are free todetermine their own liturgies, church polity, etc.  If you accept thatthe Sabbath is not binding on Christians, then the day of worshipfalls into the category of items on which individual Christians or(since worship is by its nature a group activity) churches are free todecide.--clh]

Why wouldthat apply to the baby's physical needs only but not his/her spiritualneeds to have God's grace?The purpose of confirmation is for the baby (now young adult) to decide to re-affirm for himself/herself the promises that his/herparents made at baptism.  That is where accepting Jesus into yourheart comes in.  In baptism, the parents ask Jesus to come into theirbaby's heart; at confirmation the child repeats that request independently.(By the way, these are my personal feelings, though I believe they arepretty close to what the doctrinal position of the Catholic Church onthis issue.

Additionalreason for my leaving the Catholic faith - lack of any selfless spiritualguidance by priests in my parishes.  AKA "wishy-washy". As you may gather from my comments, I feel that it is very important, ir-regardless of denominational guidelines, to have a service/Mass which promotesthe true reason that we are gathered there.  I am quite comfortable in atraditional Mass, with receiving Holy Communion on the tongue, the Sacramentof PENANCE (not Reconciliation), Stations of the Cross, so on and so forth.The reason other types of Masses and parishes exist is because these feelingsare not shared by everyone.I want more people to attend church and to find the Lord, but I don't want them attending a show.  It's not.  My church works hard to have a meaningfulservice during Lent on Wednesdays, but follow traditional Lutheran Book ofWorship guidelines.  Where things are changed or omitted during Lent (suchas the Hymn of Praise) it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that itis Not there.Quite frankly, it is very hard for a non-Catholic to go to a Mass and "fit in".My dear wife never could (former Methodist).  And Holy Week Masses and Vigilswould intimidate the daylights out of a non-Catholic.  Those Catholics whohave beared with me this far understand what I mean.Please keep in mind why we are there - to gather together in worship.  Notto worry about how something is done or not done.  If there is somethingwrong that you feel needs addressing, by all means talk to your priest orpastor.  I have only ever met one who wouldn't listen.  They are there to provide spiritual guidance and to help.  Use them.

I get a little queasy around the phrase "aren't morally responsible", perhaps because I've heard it misused so many times.(I remember in college some folk trying to argue that a person whowas drunk was not morally responsible for his actions.) In general,most folk can't control their dreams, but perhaps what you do all dayand think about has some impact on them, hm? And I'm not sure what"actions" are in a dream. But I will note that Jesus does seem adamantabout the fact that our thought-life is at least as important asour actions.

I've had dreams, somefairly vivid ones; is an OOBE just a very vivid dream? I would argue thatextreme interest in this sort of phenomena is a tad risky; it is probablymuch better to think about who Jesus is, and who we are in relation to that,than to cultivate a strong interest in dreams.

I know exactly one case oftwo people who had substantially the same dream at the same time, andas they were brothers who had spent the day doing the same things I couldsee why their dreams might be similiar. Anyway, the only "other plane" Iknow of is the spiritual realm. I don't think *anyone's* dreams,perhaps outside the occasional prophet's, represent actual actions on analternate plane. If they were real actions, or conscious thoughts, thenyes they would have direct moral significance.>3) Like (2), but here we assume that [garbled text: "because the dream occursin a different environment, then different moral laws apply" is my guess ofwhat you said.]I don't see the slightest hint in Christian writings that ones "environment"changes the way a person determines what is moral. For a Christian won'tit *always* come down to "what Jesus would have us do?">So... There it is.  Is one of these cases the truth, or does anyone know>of another alternative?  respond by post or email.Truth? I don't claim to be an expert in dreams. I'll note that the Bibledoesn't talk much about dreams outside of the realm of God using them to speakto us, with the caveat that such messages are not always very clear, as itwarns somewhere in the OT. Given that, I would not give them a lot ofattention unless you feel your dreams are trying to tell you something.I would discount talk of "alternate planes," though. The only places suchconcepts are commonly bandied about are for the most part hostile toChristianity, though I've run into the occasional exception. If you are,or want to be, a Christian, you want to be very careful about ideas likethis.

The problem is,Premise #1 presupposes 1:1 odds between belief and non-belief. This isflat out wrong, because of the sheer number of religions out there and thefact that, for the most part, the religions are mutually exclusive. I haveheard theists referred to as "99% atheists" because they believe in theirgod (or gods) to be the _one_ god (or set of gods). The consequence ofthis is "what if I pick the wrong god?"

Perhaps they were "strong inthe faith?"---------------------------[No, I don't believe that Paul can overrule God.  However Paul waswriting for a largely Gentile audience.  The Law was regarded by Jewsat the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but not on Gentiles.  Thereare rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called Noachiclaws), but they are quite minimal.  The issue that the Church had toface after Jesus' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted tofollow Christ.  The decision not to impose the Law on them didn't saythat the Law was abolished.  It simply acknowledged that fact that itdidn't apply to Gentiles.  Thus there is no contradiction with Mat 5.As far as I can tell, both Paul and other Jewish Christians didcontinue to participate in Jewish worship on the Sabbath.  Thus theycontinued to obey the Law.  The issue was (and is) with GentileChristians, who are not covered by the Law (or at least not by theceremonial aspects of it).Jesus dealt mostly with Jews.  I think we can reasonably assume thatMat 5 was directed to a Jewish audience.  He did interact withGentiles a few times (e.g. the centurion whose slave was healed and acouple of others).  The terms used to describe the centurion (see Luke7) suggest that he was a "God-fearer", i.e. a Gentile who followedGod, but had not adopted the whole Jewish Law.  He was commended byJewish elders as a worthy person, and Jesus accepted him as such.This seems to me to indicate that Jesus accepted the prevailing viewthat Gentiles need not accept the Law.However there's more involved if you want to compare Jesus and Paul onthe Law.  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law, wehave to come to grips with Paul's apparent rejection of the Law, andhow that relates to Jesus' commendation of the Law.  At least as Iread Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in acertain sense superceded.  Again, this issue isn't one of theabolition of the Law.  In the middle of his discussion, Paul notesthat he might be understood this way, and assures us that that's notwhat he intends to say.  Rather, he sees the Law as primarily beingpresent to convict people of their sinfulness.  But ultimately it's animpossible standard, and one that has been superceded by Christ.Paul's comments are not the world's clearest here, and not everyoneagrees with my reading.  But the interesting thing to notice is thateven this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law.It still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iotaor dot may be removed.  For its purpose of convicting of sin, it'simportant that it not be relaxed.  However for Christians, it's notthe end -- ultimately we live in faith, not Law.While the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in theend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  Thequoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the restof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets theLaw.  The "not an iota or dot" would suggest a rather literal reading,but in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretationsemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonialdetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitudetowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewishdiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving atenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things thatreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups andplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people whouse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, andthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specificview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining theLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.Paul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law beingsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the"ceremonial law", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quiteconcerned about maintaining moral standards.The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law beingsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believethey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul isembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in lettersresponding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of theLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewishceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standardsof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seemsto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals andhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were laterto give Paul so much trouble.It's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, butwe should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at theway terms like "family values" take on special meaning from thecurrent context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying tofigure out why "family values" should be used as a code word foropposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  Ithink Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul wasinvolved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish valuesthat go along with the term "Law", any more than people who concernedabout the "family values" movement are really opposed to familyvalues.--clh]

The Bible "ends"with the book of Revelations. But does God's reign end there ? No.So who can say for sure that God's messages are either no longerhappening or still happening ?I can now hear the clamor for proof. 8-)With the cold response I've gotten from the past from thisgroup, it's very hard to get the point across. I'll onlygo over the physical stuff so that skeptics can lookat documents stored somewhere. I've cited the uncorruptedbodies of saints before. They're still there. 8-)The apparitions at Fatima, Portugal culminated in a miraclespecifically granted to show God's existence. That wasthe spinning/descending of the sun. It was seen in severalcountries. That event is "approved" by the Pope. Currently,images of Mary in Japan, Korea, Yugoslavia, Philippines, Africaare showing tears (natural or blood). These are still underinvestigation by the Church. But realize that investigationstake decades to finish. And if the message is Christ will comein ten days, that's a bit too late, isn't it 8-).Other events under investigation are inner locutions ("comingto know"), stigmata (the person exhibits Christ's wounds. Andthey don't heal. And doctor's don't know why).Non-believers are welcome to pore through documents, I'm sure.This stuff is not like Koresh. Or Oral Roberts (give me $5Mor God will call me home). It's free. Find out why they'rehappening (as we ourselves are studying why). If anybodycan figure this out, tell us ! You can be of any religion.If you have the resources, go to one of the countries I mentioned.These are not "members only" events. God and Mary invites everybody.So in conclusion (finally) ...We RC's believe in the modern day manifestations of God and Mary.We are scared to death sometimes although we're told not to.There are more proofs and events. And that is why "not everythingis in the Bible". Although in a lot of the apparitions, we are toldto read the Bible.As far as the Protestant vs. Catholics issue is concerned...In the end, God's churches will unite. I'm not sure how.I have some idea. But the point is we shouldn't worryabout the "versus" part. Just do God's work. That's allthat matters. Unity will come.BTW, I'm just a plain person. I'm not the Pope's spokesperson.But I am RC.-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------Mark Ashley                        |DISCLAIMER: My opinions.

(Take a few>seconds and honestly ponder that thought and it's implications!!!)I have thought about the implications, and it is scary.  We have a whole generation of families broken up because some men have decided that is is okay to leave their wives and children for thethrill of a younger, more attractive woman.  If we accept that it islegitimate for Jane to have divorced, how can we not accept anyone'sdecision to divorce because he has found someone with whom he canhave a more "deep, committed relationship."Marriage is not a state of being, it is a mutual journey in life.Love is not a passive feeling, it must be actively willed.Is it acceptable for an older executive to dump his wife of many years who stayed home to care for the children because hecan't be happy sexually unless he is with a beautifulyoung blonde?  The real solution for both in the couple tomake a renewed effort.  Hold fast to the faith.  Has not the Lord repeatedly compared Hisrelation to His people as a faithful and enduring husband?  Welearn something very deep and very mystical when we marry andremain faithful through times of trial.My spouse has a brain tumor that has left her partially paralyzed.If it were to resume growing (it is in remission, thanks be to God!)then perhaps the time would come when we could not have sexualrelations.  That's life...the Lord would certainly not give mepermission to seek someone else to satisfy my "needs."  The idea that it is alright to divorce if a couple "grows apart"seems to me to lead to such a monstrous destruction of the meaningof marriage that I feel we must make every effort to avoid any hintof compromise.  We have become so petty and small-minded thatsome husbands are threatening to divorce their wives unless thewives lose weight!I praise the Lord for guiding me to marry my wife.  She married meanyway despite the possibility that I could have a terrible illness.And it turned out that she was the one with the brain tumor, buthad I known I wouldn't have cared either.  And maybe I'll be ina car accident tomorrow and become paralyzed from the neck down.A married couple should deal with these situations with the helpof the Lord, not divorce and run away from them.

It wasn't long after Sagan's admonitions thatone of our boys was adding another level of reality into his model ofthe nuclear winter scenario at ERL in Boulder.  He decided to assumethat the atmosphere is more like a two-dimensional thing, than a one-dimensional thing.  He also assumed that it rained and that the windsblow in the real atmosphere.  On returning to Georgia Tech, he showeda transparency of atmospheric cooling rates according to the year theywere generated by the models.  There was an unmistakable correlationbetween the age (meaning simplicity of assumptions; i.e., remotenessfrom reality) of each model and the degree of cooling.  Whereas Sagan'smodel showed an approximate 40-degree cooling episode, the next model in sophistication showed about half that, and so on until we got toour boy's model, which showed a 1-2 degree drop if the war happened inthe winter and less than a 10 degree drop if it happened in the summer.He predicted that when we would include the presence of oceans, chemistry,the biosphere, and other indicators of reality in the models, we wouldprobably see even less cooling.  Thus nuclear winter was reduced to evenless than a nuclear autumn, one might say, to a nuclear fizzle.To quote from H.S. Yoder,The postulated models have become accepted as the realityinstead of the lattice of assumptions they are.Authoritarianism dominates the field, and a very criticalanalysis of each argument is to be encouraged.... Skepticismof the model approach to earth problems is warranted becausemany key parameters have not been included.This statement surely applies equally well to cosmogony.  Only whenconvincing observational evidence substantiates the modeled resultsmay one suggest that the model may describe the reality.  Just thoughtI'd clear that up before things really got out of hand.  -- boundaryno teneis que pensar que yo haya venido a traer la paz a la tierra; no hevenido a traer la paz, sino la guerra (Mateo 10:34, Vulgata Latina)

Why can't>God just repeat the miracle done for Mary to make all the rest of us>sinless, without the need for repentance and salvation and all that?   Yes, Mary is fully human.  However, that does not imply that she wasjust as subject to sin as we are.  Catholic doctrine says that man'snature is good (Gen 1:31), but is damaged by Original Sin (Rom 5:12-16).In that case, being undamaged by Original Sin, Mary is more fully humanthan any of the rest of us.   You ask why God cannot "repeat the miracle" of Mary's preservationfrom Original Sin.  A better way to phrase it would be "why _did_ Henot" do it that way, but you misunderstand how Mary's salvation wasobtained.  Like ours, the Blessed Virgin Mary's salvation was obtainedthrough the merits of the Sacrifice of Christ on the Cross.  However, asGod is not bound by time, which is His creation, God is free to applyHis Sacrifice to anyone at any time, even if that person lived beforeChrist came to Earth, from our time-bound perspective.  Therefore,Christ's Death and Resurrection still served a necessary purpose, andwere necessary even for Mary's salvation.----------Steve Creps, Indiana Universitycreps@lateran.ucs.indiana.edu

I know there's a specificterm for this form of logic, but it escapes me right now. However, if itwere sound, then you should be able to apply it this way; If the Bibledoesn't specifically say that something is wrong, then it must be OK,which, coincidentally, leads perfectly into a question I've often pondered.If slavery is immoral (which I believe it is, can I assume that everyoneelse in this group does too?), why doesn't Jesus or any of the apostlesspeak out against it? Owning slaves was common practice back then. Paulspeaks about everything else that is immoral. He apparently thought itwas important enough to talk about things like not being a drunkard. Whydoesn't anyone mention slavery? If God's morals are eternal and don'tchange like the morals of society, then it must have been just as immoral thenas it is today.

What they are doing is wrong, just as whatJoseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong.They intend it for evil.

But notthe same good that He would have brought if the Serbians hadrefrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does thegood He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.]So what you're saying then, is that God exercises direct control, orinfluence upon humanity. He doesn't control our every thought or action,but takes what we do, whether it be intended for evil or not, and turnsit into something good. It seems to me, that this idea conflicts withthe belief that God gave humans FREE WILL. As far as I can determine,it is impossible to reconcile these two different ideas. If God were toexert his influence upon anyone or anything at anytime, he would be impeding upon someone's free will. Unless, of course, you believe thatGod did not give us complete and unabated free will, but rather, some sortof conditional free will. Something that allows us to make our own choicesand control our own lives except when God wants to use us to fulfill somegood purpose of his own by "hardening our heart" or controlling us in someother way. I hear alot of people who look at various events, mostly catastrophies or things like the AIDS epidemic and make comments aboutGod's will. I have a very difficult time understanding why people believethat God controls anything that happens on this planet. Except, possiblywhen being asked to through someone's prayer. According to the Bible,Pharoah was going to let Moses' people go after one or two plagues, butGod kept hardening his heart so Moses could cast all 7 plagues upon theEgyptians, the last plague causing the death of many innocent children.So then, God impeded upon Pharoah's free will and used him as a puppet.God did this not just to free the Hebrews, but to free them in some sortof a grand fashion. I suppose from the Hebrew's point of view, this couldbe seen as turning something bad into good, but I'm sure the Egyptians didn'tsee it this way. All of your examples of how God turned something bad intosomething good are based upon showing favortism to one group of people overanother. After all, it's only good based upon your point of view. Why doesGod, who is supposed to be the god of all of humanity, play favorites?

It is easy to say that the onebody represents a particular sect of Christianity (generally our own), andthe parts are clearly the various offices of ministry. There is a place forthat. But having met people who are walking closeely with God in a widevariety of doctine - Catholic, Protestant, liberal, conservative, Orthodox,etc. - I am willing to encompass a wide spectrum of views within thecontext of the 'body of Christ.' And I am equally sure that one day, afterwe shug off this mortal coil, when we no longer see through a glass darklybut see clearly, face to face, we will all be ashamed at some of the thingswe held as truth. We ought all fellowship, worship, and serve where we arecalled, and understand that where we are called may not be where everyoneelse is called.One of the fathers of the reformation (help me out - can't recall the name)put it quite succiently:In essentials, unity.In nonessentials, liberty.In all things, charity.While I agree with Lewis (Mere Christianity) that calling oneself a Christianimplies some basic, fundamental standards of belief if the word is to meananything at all, I think most of us define the bounds of essentials a bittoo broadly, deny the place for liberty in questionable issues near thosebounds, and ignore the requirements of charity all together. Me? I attend a Vineyard church, speak in tongues, am effectively aninerrantist, though I'll grant some inaccuracy in translation, am moderatelypre-mill, and evangelical. But, I'm not ready to damn those who use icons,say mass in latin, uphold the Virgin Mary (though I really don't believethat she was sinless), vote on Church membership, or insist on baptism forsalvation. Of course, I think my doctine is pretty close to the truth -why would I follow it if I believed something else was closer to the truth?But my understanding of the reality of a walk with Christ is continuallyevolving as I spend more and more time walking with Him, studying His word,and fellowshiping with others in the (often extended) family. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.                      --T.S.

In v. 4 he stated that theadoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service ofGod, and the promises were given to the Israelites.  It is a package deal. He goes on to identify those who are true Israelites.  Vs 6-8 makes itplain that the true Israelites are not those who are born that way butthose who accept the promise of God.  Paul continued to emphasize that hewas an Israelite in 2 Cor. 11:22, then in Gal 3:29 he says that all thosewho belong to Christ are Abraham's seed, and heirs to all the promisesgiven to the Israelites.  The promises come with the law.  It is all ornothing.  Why is it that you only want to discard one part of the law? Certainly you would want your husband to be faithful to you.  Or do youbelieve that adultery is no longer forbidden?  Same law.BTW  please give a reference for your statement that the Gentiles are onlyrequired to observe the basis commandmants.  Could you list thoseplease.  Acts 15 deals with circumcision and the law of Moses which wasadded because of transgression of God's eternal law (Gal 3:19; Rom 4:15)++++++++++++Darius A.

Topical, current, personal revelationI'd say is necessary.  New revelation for all people for all timesis not necessary as we have that in Scripture.You also seem to confuse canon with scripture.

If prophecy is meant to encourage,exhort or correct then is an overlap with scripture.  If prophecy ismeant to bring a `word' of the form "the man you live with is not yourhusband" then that is knowledge.

Mybrother was living with someone like that and things were almost as bad(although he left after a considerably shorter amount of time due toother problems with the relationship).  Anyway, the best thing to dowould be to get everyone in the same room together (optimally in a roomwith nothing breakable), lock the door behind you, throw the key outunderneath the door (just as far as the longest hand can reach.  Youwould like to get out after the conclusion, I would imagine), and hashthings out.  More than likely, there will be screaming, crying, andpossibly hitting (unless of course someone decided to bring some rope totie people down).  Some of the best strategies in keeping things calmerwould include:   have each individual own their own statements (ie, I feel that thisrelationship is hurting everyone involved because.... or I really don'tunderstand where you're coming from.)   reinforce statements by paraphrasing, etc. (ie, So you think that wedid this because of...?  Well, let me just say that the reason for thiswas ....)   don't accuse each other (It was your fault that ... happened!)   find a common ground about SOMETHING (Lampshades really aredecorational and functional at the same time.)   Guaranteed, in a situation like this, there is going to be somegunnysacking (re-hashing topics which were assumed resolved, but weretruly not and someone feels someone else is to blame).  However, thisshould be kept to a minimum and simply ask for forgiveness or apologizeabout each situation WITHOUT holding a smoldering grudge.  The relationship really can work.  It's just a matter of keeping thingssmooth and even.  It's sort of like making a peace treaty betweenwarring factions:  you can't give one side everything; there must be acompromise.  Breaks can be taken, but communication between everyoneinvolved must continue if the relationships here are to survive.Joe Fisher

To me the wages of sin area spiritual death, not necessarily a physical death.

It defined "R T & B" as"an individual's belief in a relation to a Supreme Being involvingduties superior to those arising from any human relation, but [notincluding] essentially political, sociological, or philosophicalviews or a merely personal moral code."In the 1965 case of UNITED STATES V.

Justice Tom Clark, delivering the Court's opinion, said:   We have concluded that Congress, in using the expression "Supreme   Being" rather than the designation "God," .... the test of belief   "in a relation to a Superme Being" is whether a given belief that   is sincere and meaningful occupies a place in the life of its   possessor parallel to that filled by the orthodox belief in God   of one who clearly qualifies for the exemption. Where such   beliefs have parallel positions in the lives of their respective   holders we cannot say that one is "in a relation to a Supreme   Being" and the other is not...."My immediate reference is THE FIRST FREEDOM, by Nat Hentoff,(Delacorte 1980, Dell 1981).

Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the finalresting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one everclaimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why?Because everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.Although there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption ofMary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelationthat describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crownedin the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has otherinterpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.The assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship toChrist.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled therequirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, weare to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking hismother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, hetook his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not toallow her flesh to rot in the grave.One last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrineon the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Marydid not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe.The dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid sayingwhether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholictheologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would makesense: Christ died, and his Mother, who waited at the foot of thecross, would want to share in his death.Brian Finnerty

These people -- and those associated with them    ("Now there were with us seven brethren", Matt. 22:25) -- would not    be receptive to such higher blessings as eternal marriage.  Hence,    the people in the story would likely not be married in the eterni-    ties; but that doesn't mean other, more faithful people could not    have this blessing.(2) Jesus was making a distinction between the state or condition of    =being= married, and the process of =becoming= married.  The latter    activity (marrying and giving in marriage) will not take place in    the eternities, because all eternal marriages will be taken care of    before then.(3) The account as we have it (in all three of the synoptic Gospels) is    missing something that would make its real meaning clearer.  Note    that we (LDS) do not believe in Biblical inerrancy, so we do not in    general feel obliged to reconcile each and every Bible text with    modern revelation through Joseph Smith and other latter-day proph-    ets.  Nor are we particularly upset that the account in question    was not significantly revised in the "Joseph Smith Translation" or    "Inspired Version" of the Bible, since we do not believe this work    was completed or that failure to revise a passage in the JST con-    stitutes divine approval of that passage as it stands in the KJV.-- Rich Wales <richw@mks.com>       //      Mortice Kern Systems Inc.

In the last fewyears it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass.  It'sdriving me crazy!  The most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition isthat what happens is something we _all_ do together, because we all know how to do it.  Led by the priest, of course, which makes it a kind of dialogue we present to God.  But the best Masses I've been to were participatory prayers.Lately, I think the proportion of participation has fallen, and the proportionof sitting there and watching, or listening, or generally being told what to do(which is necessary because no one knows what's happening next) is growing.Example.  Last Sunday (Palm Sunday) we went to the local church.  Usuallyon Palm Sunday, the congregation participates in reading the Passion, takingthe role of the mob.  The theology behind this seems profound--when we say"Crucify him" we mean it.  We did it, and if He came back today we'd do itagain.  It always gives me chills.  But last week we were "invited" to sitduring the Gospel (=Passion) and _listen_.  Besides the Orwellian "invitation", I was really saddened to have my (and our) little role taken away.  This seemstypical of a shift of participation away from the people, and toward themusicians, readers, and so on.  New things are introduced in the course of theliturgy and since no one knows what's happening, the new things have to beexplained, and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass we're justsitting there listening (or spacing out, in my case) to how the Mass is aboutto be done.  In my mind, I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay"experts", but that may not be just.  I do think that a liturgy committee has abias toward doing something rather than nothing--that's just a fact ofbureaucratic life--even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier forpeople to be aware of the Lord's presence.So we've been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Massgoing down?  I don't mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday orFriday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware of God's presence.  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses...maybe I should just offer it up :)  Has anyone else noticed declining congregationalparticipation in Catholic Masses lately?John Murray

Should theyfail to make a sufficient attempt to teach their children, the parent would be held responsible-- not for their children's sins, but for notteaching them properly.Whenever the Lord installs someone to a position of authority in either the family or the church Heexpects that person to teach those in his charge.In Ezekiel 33:7-9 someone called to care for others is likened to "a watchman unto the house of Israel.""If thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that man shall die in his iniquity; buthis blood will I require at thine hand.Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, heshall die in his iniquity; but thou hastdelivered thy soul."Even though the D&C prefaces this commandment with"parents have children in Zion" I believe allparents are responsible for teaching their children whatever good principles they understand.However, LDS parents accept greater responsbilityand could be judged more strictly.A IDLER

"Oh wow..all i have to do is >follow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness.">For all of you "found jeezus" , how many of you were "on the brink?"I disagree that Christianity is "an infectious cult".  It hascertainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, inspite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.That it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is"infectious" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it providesa workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that thisis the case).I disagree that Christianity is "a safety blanket" which supplantshope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the oneSource of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about aChristian's source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness toyou is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purposeand externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss ofcontrol over one's own life the problem or is it something else?Finally, one does not appropriate "eternal happiness" by followingChristian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existanceof Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save peoplefrom their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to theChristian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christianin the Person of God's Spirit.Heaven is one of two final states thatChristian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generallynot motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by thispromised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceivedbenefits to them in the here-and-now.>but i digress...

However, it is not the penultimatepriority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,convert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).Rather, such evangelism is generally best done through respectingthe opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefitsof a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerfulthat it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask"Why?"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-plished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), itdoes not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christianis required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds offriendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannotevaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate orharm others if the sole purpose of being a "friend" is to gain aconversion).As a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-ticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a "hurry-up"attitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than noconversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he wascoerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been opento it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).The Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which bringsconviction of wrong-doing to people.

But if you can contriveto control the action in dreams or do an OOBE, it seems like a morality applies.Now, there seem to be 3 alternatives:1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.  In this case no moralityapplies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene', that is, not tryingto think about anything evil, or indulgining in overly sexy or violentthoughts.2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane')Evidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done incommon by more than one person.  Amark of objective fact is that >1 people report the same objective experience.In this case, the same interpersonal morality/ethics applies in dreams andOOBEs as does in waking life.3) Like (2), but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have areal existence, a different moral/ethics apply there, and no (or maybe different) moral laws apply there.So... There it is.  Is one of these cases the truth, or does anyone knowof another alternative?  respond by post or email.thanks very much*dt*========================================================.

In fact he says repeatedly that faith establishes rather that annulsthe law.  Paul's point is germane to both Jews and Greeks.  The Law cannever be used as an instrument of salvation.  And please do not combinethe ceremonial and moral laws in one.In Matt 5:14-19 Christ plainly says what He came to do and you say He wasonly saying that for the Jews's benefit.

Homosexual acts and acts of beastiality aretopically aranged together in the law.  This is very important.Anyone who would want to say that this command against homosexualitydeals with temple prostitution (and I think you would agree that thereis no proof for this.)  If the Law reveals the character of God, and is "holy, just, and good" as is written in the New Testament, thenthose who consider we who are against commiting homosexuals actsto be biggots have to address this passage of Scripture.  Why must we only discuss Scriptures that involve consensual humanadult relationships?  Isn't that bordering on sophistry?  The pointwe are making is that God did not ordain certain kinds of sex acts.Not everyone who brings up these Scriptures is just trying to use and emotionalargument that compares homosexuals to beastophiles and child molestors.The issue we are dealing with is that some sex acts are ungodly.  I do not have problem with a loving, nonlustful relationship with a memberof the same sex.  I have them, and we all do.  The issue at hand is the sinfulness having sex with members of the same sex, or lusting after.So other forbidden sex acts are a valid topic for conversation. And the idea that these relationships may be  emotional  relationshipsbetween adult humans is red herring.  We all agree that it is okay for adults to  have caring relationships with one another.Link Hudson.

Like I said before, I can understand why non-Christians would be denied *access* to holy ceremonies, but the ceremony itself (communion) was not secret.  In fact, all four gospels record the first "breaking of the bread" in some detail.  Communion was a fellowship meal, and it was (and still should be, in my opinion) inappropriate to invite those who did not share in the fellowship of the Body of Christ.  The fact that unbelievers, denied access to these communal meals, began to imagine all sorts of secret and debased rituals during communion does not by any means imply that the early Christians were in fact hiding shameful things from the general public.  In fact, I think if you read some of the early church fathers, you will find that they were not at all bashful about describing what went on during communion.  That's why it seems funny to me when Mormons, who claim to be the only true restoration of 1st century Christianity, insist on hiding certain rituals on the grounds that they are "too sacred."- Mark[Actually, that's not quite the case.  John omits the central elementsof the Last Supper.  His Gospel is full of symbolism of bread andwine.  But the actual story isn't there.  Some people think he hasomitted some of the details because they were not talked about inpublic in his community.  There is also evidence that some aspects ofbaptismal practice were kept secret. See Morton Smith's "SecretGospel" -- I don't agree with his lurid speculations on what thesecret practices actually were, but there does seem to be someevidence that Mark omitted certain details because they were inappropriate for publication.  --clh]

The pastor here seemsto have a most unbaptist view of baptism- one that seems to demand theceremony even when comprehension and choice are absent.We do baptize converts, but no one who has been deceived into hearingthe word is likely to be a convert.  If in fact the grace of God mightwork in such a situation, there is no harm done in waiting a day ortwo.Baptist believe in regenerate membership.

The Orthodox have said that>they accept all that it says, with the exception of the filioque, but>it is not "in use."Which is exactly what I pointed out.  (Though I was wrong about your useof the Creed, the 1913 Catholic Encylcopedia in which I read about itsaid the Orthodox do use the Creed minus the filioque.  Apparently thathas changed.)  The Athanasian Creed has always had the Filioque, theNicene - Constantinopolitan did not.Of course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the NiceneCreed (it wasn't there to begin with), but they certainly did from theAthanasian Creed, which did have it from the beginning.I might point out that the whole problem started over the difference inways of explaining the generation of the Blessed Trinity, the Eastemphasizing the idea of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Fatherthrough the Son, and the West using proceeding from the Father and theSon.  In fact, some, such as Tertullian, used both formulations (seebelow)"Following, therefore, the form of these examples, I profess that I docall God and His Word, - the Father and and His Son, - two.  For theroot and the stem are two things, but conjoined; the fountain and theriver are two kinds, but indivisible; the sun and the ray are two forms,but coherent ones.  Anything which proceeds from another mustnecessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds; but it is not onthat account separated from it.  Where there is second, however, thereare two; and where ther is third, there are three.  The Spirit, then, isthird from God and the Son, just as the third from the root is the fruitof the stem, and third from the fountain is the stream from the river,and thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray."-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 8, 5 (about 213 AD)and"I believe that the Spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the Fatherthrough the Son"-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 4, 1 (about 213 AD)And as St. Thomas showed in his Summa Theologica Part 1, Question 36,Articles 2 and 3, there is no contradiction between the two methods ofgeneration, and in fact, the two methods of reckoning the processionemphasize what St. Augustine, among others taught, that the Holy Spiritproceeds from the Father and the Son, but He proceeds from the Father ina more preeminent way."For whatever the Son has, He has from the Father, certainly He has itfrom the Father that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him ... For theFather alone is not from another, for which reason He alone is calledunbegotten, not, indeed, in the Scriptures, but in the practice oftheologians, and of those who employ such terms as they are able in amatter so great.  The Son, however, is born of the Father; and the HolySpirit proceeds principally from the Father, and since the Father givesto the Son all that He has without any interval of time, the Holy Spiritproceeds jointly from both Father and Son.  He would be called Son ofthe Father and of the Son if, which is abhorent to everyone of soundmind, they had both begotten Him.  The Spirit was not begotten by each,however, but proceeds from each and both."-St. Augustine of Hippo, The Trinity, 15, 26, 47 (400 to 416 AD)So, in a sense, all of the formulations are correct (to the West atleast), because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son, butin proceeding from the Son, the orgin of that procession is theprocession from the Father, so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from theFather through the Son, but as all that the Son has is from the Father,the Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the Father, without anymention of the Son being necessary.In any case, I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of PopeSt. Leo I, St. Fulgence of Ruspe, St. Cyril of Alexandria, Pope St.Damsus I, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Epiphanius of Salamis, St. Ambroseof Milan, St. Hilary of Poitiers, Tertullian, and others among theFathers, who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholicposition, which I enunciated above.As for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden, Iwill point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spokeof the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone "to produce,write, or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined bythe Fathers of Nicea."  That Creed is a different Creed than that ofConstantinople, which is commonly called the Nicene Creed.  Not ofcourse in that they were condemning the adoption of theConstantinopolitan Creed, which is but an enlargement upon the Creed ofNicea, but that they were condemning the impious opinions of Nestorious,who had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by theChurch, which among other things denied the procession of the HolySpirit form the Son.  Thus, the additions of the ConstantinopolitanCreed were not thought to be in violation of this, and as the CouncilChalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the HolySpirit from the Son, which Nestorius denied, they could hardly have beenagainst explaining in a fuller way the Creed, for they themselvesapproved of previous additions to it.  And if the further explanationsof the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the workdone by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way heretical, it followsthat the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputedby the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Ariansin Spain, because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church untilmany years later under Photius and others.  And that the filioque wasnot disputed, I provide more quotes below."Since the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed toGod, and he actually proceeds from the Father and Son, it is abundantlyclear that He is of the divine essence, in it in essence and proceedingfrom it."-St. Cyril of Alexandria, The Treasury of the Holy and ConsubstantialTrinity, Thesis 34, (423-425 AD)"The Holy Spirit is not of the Father only, or of the Son only, but heis the Spirit of the Father and the Son.  For it is written: `If anyoneloves the world, the Spirit of the Father is not in him'; and again itis written: `If anyone, however, does not have the Spirit of Christ, heis none of His.'  When the Father and the Son are named in this way, theHoly Spirit is understood, of whom the Son himself says in the Gospel,that the Holy Spirit `proceeds from the Father,' and that `He shallreceive of mine and shall announce it to you.'"-Pope St. Damasus I, The Decree of Damasus, 1 (382 AD)"The only-begotten Holy Spirit has neither the name of the Son nor theappelation of Father, but is called Holy Spirit, and is not foreign tothe Father.  For the Only-begotten Himself calls Him: `the Spirit of theFather,' and says of Him the `He proceeds from the Father,' and `willreceive of mine,' so that He is reckoned as not being foreign to theSon, but is of their same substance, of the same Godhead; He is Spiritdivine, ... of God, and He is God.  For he is Spirit of God, Spirit ofthe Father, and Spirit of the Son, not by some kind of synthesis, likesoul and body in us, but in the midst of Father and Son of the Fatherand of the Son, a third by appelation...."The Father always existed and the Son always existed, and the Spiritbreathes from the Father and the Son; and neither is the Son created noris the Spirit created."-St. Epiphanius of Salamis (which is on Cyprus), The Man Well-Anchored,8 and 75 (374 AD)"Concerning the Holy Spirit, I ought not to remain silent, nor yet isit necessary to speak.  Still, on account of those who do not know Him,it is not possible for me to be silent.  However it is necessary tospeak of Him who must be acknowledged, who is from the Father and theSon, His Sources."-St. Hilary of Poitiers, The Trintiy, 2, 29 (356 to 359 AD)Thus, as I have pointed out before, Gaul, Spain, Italy, Africa, Egypt,Palastine, and the lands of the Greeks, all of Christnedom at that time,all have Fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrineexpressed by the filioque.  I suggest to those of the Orthodox Churchthat they come up with some of the Fathers, besides St. John of Damascuswho all will admit denied the filioque, to support their views.  It isnot enough to bring up the "proceeds from the Father" line of the Creedor the Gospel of John, for that says what we believe also.  But it doesnot say the Holy Spirit does not proceed from the Son, only that He doesproceed from the Father.Andy Byler

Where Luke (1:17) reportsthe angel Gabriel prophesying that John will go before Christ "in the power and spirit of Elias", In Matthew 11: 14, Jesus himself says of John,      "And if you care to accept it, he himself is Elijah, who    was to come".It is interesting that Jesus prepended the words, "If you care to acceptit", as if to say that the implications of this truth, namely of rein-carnation, I will not force on you, but for those who can accept it, here itis.  A Jewish poster to other newsgroups on Jewish esotericism and othertopics has outlined the esoteric, cabbalistic Jewish teaching of ofreincarnation and Karma, a teaching that is little known among Jewstoday, but which is apparently widespread enough in Israel that HannahHurnard ("Hinds Feet on High Places") was told about it by a Rabbishe was trying to convert back in the 1940s as a missionary in Palestine.Thus there may well have been a small number of Jews who knew about this,whereas the large number of people did not.  The statement of Jesus about John, the greatest human personality in the New Testament, is guardedbut nevertheless quite direct.  Again, the subject of reincarnation, oneway or another, is not a subject of the New Testament, nor is the fate in generalof the human being between death and the last judgement.  But there are occasional indications that point to it.As for the "popular belief" that Elijah would come again, it was more than a popular belief, as Jesus confirms it in more than one place, and he never corrected those who were expecting Elijah --  for example, those who thought that Jesus himself be he.Gerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)

Does He grade ona curve, does He cheat? That is interesting. Not to mention thoughtprovoking. My own concept is that He is a Father and we are Hischildren. In that He loves us, with a love that we can never understanduntil we are with Him. The Bible says that He looks on the heart as thefinal measure. From that perspective, in a grading context, the heart isthe final test.Specifically, most Christians would agree that there is only one Heavenand one Hell. From that perspective, it is Heaven or Hell. You either goto one or the other. The "grading" on a pass/fail basis is done by Godthe Father with intervention by Jesus the Son. Not by others. For onlyGod sees the heart. The Bible says of the heart, "...who can know it." Iwould say there has always been, and always be, an unchanging method.That is what makes a relationship with Christ so secure. In an uncertainand ever changing landscape He is always the same. Yesterday, today andtomorrow. Concerning whether or not our childhoods are considerd as partof the test, my own conviction is no. Were that the case I certainlywouldn't be going to Heaven. The Bible speaks very plainly about thelove and care Jesus had for and about children. The reality is that weare all children. Some of us just have bigger bodies and grey hair. Butthe Father, our Father is always there. Like most Fathers He wants onlythe best for His own. There maybe decipline, but there is more love.It's sometimes looks like Christianity is a test, to see who makes itand who doesn't. Those who do pass=Heaven, and those who don't go to theother place. But it is really much more than that...There are few experts. Most of us are just travelers looking for thelight and the way Home. Praying that we can bring others with us.

A week ago, I managed to find time to consulta Septuagint Concordance and a LXX text with apparatus at the library,and I can now usefully conclude my look at the Greek words for love asused in the Christian background of the Septuagintal translation of theJewish scriptures.The principal result is that there is a cluster of uses of the verbalnoun from _erao:_, _eraste:s_ meaning "lover."  This cluster occurs justwhere one might most expect it, in the propethic image (and accusation)of Israel as faithless spouse to YHWH.  The verses in question are Hosea2:5,7 & 10; Jeremiah 4:30, 22:20 & 22; Lamentations 1:19; and Ezekiel16:33, 36 &37 and 23:5, 9 & 22.[ Hosea seems to have originated this usage, which Jeremiah and  Ezekiel picked up;  Lamentations is dependent on, though not  likely written by, Jeremiah. ]The "erotic" meaning (in its allegorical use, not at all literally) isevident.  So too in English, unless you complement it with a phrase like"of the arts" the word "lover" is going to have an overtone of sexualrelationship.  There is no surprise here, but it is worthwhile to seethat standard Greek usage *does* show up in the translations from theHebrew! :-)More interestingly, and some confirmation of my guess that later Koineusage avoided the verb _erao:_ because of its homonymy to _ero:_ (say),_eromai_ (ask), there is an error in Codex Vaticanus (normally, a veryvaluable witness) where a form of _erao:_ is used in a completely absurdcontext -- 2 Samuel 20:18, where the  meaning *must* be "say."In addition to the above (and the uses I have already mentioned in Proverbs),Esther 2:17 uses the verb in its most natural application, kai e:rasthe" ho basileus Esthe:r  --  and the King loved Estherand, rather more interestingly, 1 Samuel 19:2 supplies a modest degree ofsupport to the gay appraisal of the relationship of David and Jonathan:kai Io:nathan huios Saoul e:[i]reito ton Dauid sphodra-- and Jonathan, Saul's son, loved David intensely[ I'm using the bracketed [i] for io:ta subscript, which I  don't yet have a reasonable ASCII convention for. ](The relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit aboutthe "historical" facts, but just that a quasi-official translation ofthe Hebrew text in the Hellenistic period makes no bones about using the"erotic" verb in this context.  Given the quite general usage of _agapao:_for erotic senses, this need not mean anything "more" than _agapao:_ alonewould mean, but it DOES disambiguate the relationship, as far as thistranslator goes!)-- Michael L.

Am I mistaken with this understanding?Yes, to some degree. There was an excellent discussion in sci.skepticon the nature of scientific work two weeks ago, I hope it did notescape your notice. The correct word is 'likely'. There is no way to be sure our models andtheories are absolutely correct. Theories are backed up by evidence,but not proved - no theory can be 'true' in a mathematical sense.However, theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations ofphenomena. It is extremely important to test whether theories can_predict_ something new or not yet observed. All successful theoriesscience has come up with have passed this test, including the BigBang theory of cosmic evolution, the theory of natural selection etc.It does not mean they _must_ be correct, but they are not mere'best fits' for the data. > = But if you claim that there must be> = an answer to "how" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from > = "nothing", science has some good candidates for an answer.> All of which require something we Christians readily admit to: ``Faith''.Well, yes, if you want to _believe_ in them. This is not what sciencerequires - take a good look at the theory and the evidence, see ifthe theory has made any successful predictions, and use your reason.Disbelievers are not punished. > The fact that there are several candidates belies that *none* are conclusive.  > With out conclusive evidence, we are left with faith.This is what puzzles me - why do we need to have faith in _anything_?My fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist - someone who isunable to believe, ie, fails to entertain any belief in God.

No, it is not, although it does look like one. This is a true dichotomy,either something exists, or nothing exists. If nothing exists, nobodywould ask why. If something exists, it is possible to ask why, butactually no existing being could give an answer. Imagine, for a moment, that the nobodies in non-existence could alsoask: "Why nothing exists?" This is equivalent to my counter-question,"why nothing exists in nothingness". Now, "why anything exists" is equivalent to "why something exists insomethingness".  _This_ is what I meant with my tautology, my apologiesfor the poor wording in my previous post.> I might add, the worldview of "Things that exist do, and things that> don't...don't" is as grounded in the realm of the non-falsifiable,> as does the theist's belief in God.

However, they will stillleave open the question "why this, and not that", and this is wheretheistic explanations come in.Science cannot give reasons for any _particular_ human being's existence.> We come to this. Either "I am, therefore I am.", or "I am for a reason."This is a deep philosophical question - is determinism true, or not?Also, is God deterministic or not? I tend to think this question hasno meaning in His case. If I am for a reason, I've yet failed to see what it would be. From our perspective, it looks like 'I' exist for truly randomreasons. I just rolled two dice - why did I get 6 and 1? How canI believe there is any better reason for my existence?> If the former is a satisfactory answer, then you are done, for you are> satisfied, and need not a doctor.

Yes, I am satisfied with this reason, until I find something better.My 15 years of Christianity were of no help in this respect, I haveto admit, but I am patient.> = Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence.> = This sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God> = Himself exist, then?

Of course, thisshould not be any obstacle to belief in His existence.> I also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer "why".   It> appears that M. Pihko agrees (as we shall see).  But because a tool is> inadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question.  Asserting> that 'why' is an invalid question does not provide an answer.  It is impossible to know unknowable things. However, the question "why do I exist, in particular" is _not_ an invalid question - thisis not what I said. But from our perspective, it is impossible totell, and I can't just believe in any given explanation instead ofanother, especially since I found I was deluding myself. > My apologies.  I was using why as "why did this come to be".  Why did> pre-existence become existence.  Why did pre-spacetime become spacetime.I think "pre-existence" is an oxymoron. There is no time 'outside' ofthis spacetime (except in some other universe), and from that perspective, our universe never was. It exists only for those whoare inside it. > But we come to the admission that science fails to answer "Why?".

I also worship on Saturday to honor the Lord.  Your mention of "[esteeming] all days alike" IMO has to do with the fast days observed by the Jews.  But no matter how you interpret that passage, I do accept your worship on Sunday as being done in honor of the Lord, in contrast with what many of my fellow SDA believers may believe.  To me, though, the bible overwhelmingly points to Saturday as the day to be kept in honor of creation and of God's deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.  To those who would attempt to point out that my observance of Saturday is being legalistic, this is simply not the case.  Rather, keeping Saturday allows me a full day to rest and contemplate God's goodness and grace.>>However I'd like to be clear that I do not think there's unambiguous>proof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.

Paul wanted them to lay aside money for the collection as first priority, before spending their money on other things.  I do not have any proof in front of me for this though, although it would explain why they would lay aside money in their homes instead of a meeting.  >So I think the most obvious reading of this is that "on the first day>of every week" simply means every time they gather for worship.  >>I think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements>is that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian>worship was.It would seem to me that you assume that the christians in the NT regularly worshipped on the first day.

Random Misconfigured SiteLines: 60Approved: christian@aramis.rutgers.eduThe problems with Catholic liturgy are likely to continue forsome time.  The problem is, in a nutshell, this: the Liturgy is asymbolic action - in other words Catholics do [or should] believe thatthe _signs_ during the mass - Water, Blessings, Vestments, Altar,Relics, etc - are real. That is the sprinkling of water bestows real,almost tangible, holiness, the Vestments are a real indication of realsacred time. The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by allto be connected to an underlying REAL referent. This kind of thinkingprecludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, itsimply IS holy.But, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially ifwell- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. We are more likelyto see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but whichcould be replaced with other signs. In concrete terms, this means themass has become a commercial for God's grace rather than the realthing. You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn'tdare with the real thing [ask Coca-Cola Co.!]. These attitudes havebeen encouraged by Liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusingon _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning inliturgy. You can only create signs, symbols have to come from God [orthe heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. The most dramaticexample of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment ofthe sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. Now, with pitabread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands coveredin particles. If the Host is a sign of Grace, this isnt and issue; butCatholics in the past would have been distraught at this realdesacration of the real symbol of Jesus' body.Modern Catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift. Wetry to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniacpriest get up and 'explain' what we are doing - so we stop doing it andstart pretending to do it. This is not a soul filling experience.It doesn't help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two andthree chord ersatz-folk music [again a result of mis-analysis: complicatedtunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was thegenius of Wesley and the 19C Anglican hymn writers]. Taize' is onlyslightly better.What are we to do? Well I suggest rejecting the parish system if itdoesn't work for you. Search out a Church where the liturgy is wellprepared not well-explained. They exist in every city. This is not BTWa matter of particular style: the music might be old or new. It isthe attitude of the church that counts. Also, note that a conservativeliturgy - harking back to pre-Vatican II days, does not necessarily meanthe Church will be socially conservative.In NYC I can recommend:Corpus Christi - W 12st St.Corpus Christi - W 12st St. - very conservative liturgy, St. Joseph's, Greenwich Village.  - Modern, "clean", largely gayOratorian Church, Brooklyn - Very beautifulAvoid, anywhere, anytime a church with electric candles.Happy Easter: Christos Aneste', Christos Voskrezhne, Christ is RisenPaul HalsallHalsall@murray.fordham.edu

The basic problem with your argument is your total and complete reliance onthe biblical text.  Luke's account is highly suspect (I would refer you tothe hermeneia commentary on Acts).  Moreover Luke's account is written atleast 90 years after the fact.  In the meantime everyone he mentions has diedand attempts to find actual written sources behind the text have come upwith only the we section of the later portion of acts as firmly established.Moreover, Pauls account of some of the events in Acts (as recorded in Galatians) fail to establish the acts accounts. What we need, therefore, is a reliable text, critically appreciated, whichdocuments the death of Christians for belief in the Resurrection.

The reason I am threatened by Sciencehas nothing to do with my need for proof of my Lord's existence--God reveals Himself in many ways, including, to some degree,Science.My problem with Science is that often it allows us toassume we know what is best for ourselves.  God endowed uswith the ability to produce life through sexual relations,for example, but He did not make that availible to everyone.Does that mean that if Science can over-ride God's decisionthrough alterations, that God wills for us to have the powerto decide who should and should not be able to have children?  Should men be allowed to have babies, if thatis made possible.People have always had the ability to end livesunnaturally, and soon may have the ability to bring livesinto the world unnaturally.  The closest thing to artificiallycreated life is artificially created death, and as Godhas reserved judgement about when people should die toHimself, I believe we should rely on God's wisdom about howpeople should be brought in to the world.This is not to say that I reject all forms ofmedical treatment, however.  Treatment that alleviatespain, or prevents pain from occuring, is perfectlyacceptable, I believe, as it was acceptable for Jesusto cure the sick.  However, treatment that merely prolongs life for no reason, or makes unnecessary alterations to the body for mere aesthetic purposes,  go too far.  Are we not happy with the beauty Godgave us?I cannot draw a solid line regarding where Iwould approve of Scientific study, and where I would not,but I will say this:  Before one experiments with theuniverse to find out all its secrets, one should askwhy they want this knowledge.  Before one alters the bodythey have been given, they should ask themseles why theirbody is not satisfactory too them as it is.  I cannotmake any general rules that will cover all the cases, butI will say that each person should pray for guidancewhen trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe, andshould cease their unravelling if they have reason to believe their search is displeasing to God.---Malcusco

In a way, some view "work" as a blessing (Ecclesiastes is a fun book! - for melancholies).I hope I do not sound caustic, maybe you can enlighten me further.Well, this is certainly a delicate subject, and I guess you accomplished what you state as your purpose "It summarizes arguments for allowing Christian homosexuality", not for me the most noble goal, but you are writing a FAQ.I wonder if you might temporize the apparent "sentence" of the specific homosexual you propose (arguably tenuously define).> The danger in advising Christians to> depend upon such a change is clear: When "conversion" doesn't happen,> which is almost always, the people are often left in despair, feeling> excluded from a Church that has nothing more to say but a requirement> of life-long celibacy.   Perhaps that would be true of "celibacy from homosexual relations", or refrainng from their choice relationships, but that does not forbid heterosexual.  Could they not have/enjoy heterosexual relations "for what it was worth"? [This depends upon the person.  In some cases I think the answer isno.  Even with those who could, consider what you're asking.  I assumewe're talking about marriage -- I certainly would not want to suggestsex outside that.  You're talking about a permanent commitment to akind of sexual relationship that they aren't really sure they can livewith.  There may be people for whom this is a possible solution, but Iwonder whether it's entirely fair to the other partner.  I have acousin who was a victim of exactly this situation.  We found out later(after her death) that her husband had had problems with his sexualidentity.  His family (conservative Christians) knew it, and pushedhim into getting married.  He continued having problems, and they werenear divorce.  She died in an accident whose circumstances some of therelatives consider odd.  He has since had a sex change operation, andhas been moving around from state to state without being able to holda job, keeping their children in a kind of home life both sets ofgrandparents consider irresponsible.  I hope you can understand why Iam not enthusiastic about pushing homosexuals into marriage.  I reallyliked my cousin.  This is sort of an emotional issue for me.  Again,it may be possible for some, but this is the sort of situation thatneeds to be dealt with pastorally and not as a matter of fixedideology.  --clh]

This just really blew my socks off.  Read I Tim1: 3-11.  Verses 3-8 speaks against those who have perverted the teachings ofthe Mosaic Law.  In vv.9-10, we have, *IN ORDER*, the 5th thru the 9thcommandments and in the midst of this listing is "homosexuals."  The decalogue,above everything else, is seen as God's absolute.  If you don't believe inabsolutes, then you have nothing do do with Jehovah of the OT, which Paulreveals to be the Messiah of the NT. "Lord Christ Jesus" transliterates to read"Jehovah's Anointed Savior."    In I Cor5, we see the same emphasis of moral separation from the pagangentiles as we do in Lev 18-20.  In I Cor 6:9-10, only one notation (drunkards)is not found in Lev 18-20.  Paul was not naive in his use of the LXX.  He knewfull well how he was using the Law of God that was given in the OT, forapplication in the NT.  As I've said, the Law was fulfilled, not done awaywith.>>of questions we are trying to deal with.

We can do better than "probably" which is not an adequate defense against thestatement that Paul's culture didn't have the same understanding ofhomosexuality as ours.  Again read the article because it uses facts.>>I claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is>>not entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.>>I don't see how you come to that conclusion.I think I do, because I have worked in the homosexual community by means ofworking with AIDs patients.  The pastoral is merely the practical applicationof the theological truth however.  Those who are working thru the issue ofhomosexuality need to have our love and understanding just as with a friend whois contiplating cheating on his wife or a friend who lives with his girlfriend,yet you continue to witness to him.  But, once the choice is made, and there isno remorse, then I feel that Paul's "pastoral" care, as presented in theCorinthian Church, come to bear significance.  THe one in active rebellionshould be placed outside of the church if a believer, and if a non-believer,then one wipes his sandels and leaves it in Gods hand.  If there was a memberin your youth group who was constantly pawing at the little girls, you wouldn'thesitate to deal with the matter quickly and decisivly.  That, in part, betraysthe present "political correctness" of the issue.  Pederasty is not accepted atthe present, but some how we are to accept homosexuality because the latter ispolitically correct, while the former is not -at least not yet.  THis is howthe morals decay.  I guess this would follow the liberal application in the political realm ofeconomics.  The liberals want to tax the rich in the federal, yet in their ownstates, when they try to get businesses to settle there, they give taxincentives to these same richies.  It comes down to a moral code ofrelativeness, or to use the cultural thing, politically correct -at the moment.--Rex[You might want to look over 1 Tim 1:10 again.  If this is really the5th through 9th commandments, we seem to be missing thieves, andhomosexuals would have to be fit in under adultery.  This is of coursepossible if "arsenokoitia" has a narrower meaning than homosexualityin general, but I think that's not your thesis.  I have no objectionper se to the idea that the author of 1 Tim might have quoted the 10commandments, but 5 through 9, minus one and plus a few things, beginsto look a bit marginal.  --clh]

There is no question here of thesimplistic idea of karma as a machine that is the sole determinerof one's destiny.  Even the eastern traditions, or many of them,do not say that, as one knowledgeable poster pointed out.And if in fact that Paul did not know about or believe in reincarnationdoes not say anything one way or another about it.  Even John the Baptist,who Jesus says emphatically is Elijah (Matt 11:14), does not appear to have been aware of it, at least at the point at which he was asked. But it is interesting that his threefold denial -- to the question whether he is the Christ, the Prophet (i.e. Isaiah), or Elijah, is emphatic in the first case and very weak in the third.I would like to add once again that, while it is important to discuss thedifferent passages that may point directly to the teaching of repeatedearth lives, one way or another, what I really see as important in ourtime is that the subject be revisited in terms of the larger view ofChristianity and Christian doctrine.  For the most part, those who doaccept it either reject the central ideas of Christianity or, if theyare Christians, hold their conviction as a kind of separate treasure.I believe that Christianity has important new understanding to bringto bear on it, and vice versa, much that is central to Christianitytakes on entirely new dimensions of meaning in light of repeated earthlives. It has a direct bearing on many of the issues frequently discussed in this newsgroup in particular.I have said openly that I have developed my views of repeated earth liveslargely from the work of Rudolf Steiner.  Not that I hold him as anauthority, but the whole picture of Christianity becomes clearer in lightof these ideas.  Steiner indicated that the old consciousness of reincar-nation necessarily had to fade away that it could be renewed in latertimes, after a time of development of the Christ idea through the firsttwo millenia after Christ's deed on Golgotha.  In our own time, it becomes important that, having received the basic gospel of salvation, our understanding of life and of the human being can now grow to embrace the significance of this idea.  For the discussions in this newsgroup, I have tried to focus on that which can be related as directly as possible to scripture and to fundamental Christian teaching and tradition.Gerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)

Put another way, the question is whether homosexualintercourse is the only act that Christians are supposed to believeis immoral solely on the basis that God says it is, with no insightbeing offered as to *why* it is immoral. No one could answer myquestion in either form from the Bible. (I did get an interestingresponse based on Roman Catholic theology).However, I think now that I can at least answer my first question.Link Hudson pointed me to it in his recent comments about sleepingwith one's aunt. Incest is held to be immoral in every society,that is, there are some degrees of relationship where marriage(and thus, intercouse) is prohibited. The Bible is no exception.The trouble is that it may be difficult to see *why* a particularrelationship qualifies as incestuous. Societies differ as tohow they define incest. Genetic reasons are sometimes offered, butall the Biblical cases cannot be dealt with that way. Why can'ta man sleep with his step mother--assuming that his father isdead and that he has "married" her? How does this case differfrom the *duty* to marry one's brother's childless wife.Are these two cases parallel? Does the Bible prohibit some incestuousmarriages and homosexual marriages for the same reason, perhapsthat God knows they are not good for us and yet we are incapableof understanding why.P.S. Please don't bother writing me to tell me that I am a homophobe,as some did last time. My mind is not made up on these questions.You don't know whether I am homophobic or not. You don'tknow me. To call me or anyone else a homophobe without knowing theperson may be as much an expression of bigotry as some homophobicremarks.-- Stan Armstrong.

That thetrue reality underneath the the physical is spirit.  That this world isa school of sorts, where we learn and grow, and our souls mature.  Thatgives a purpose to my little purposes, and takes some of the pressureoff.  It's not so necessary to make this life a success in human termsif you're really just here to learn.

We have biblical accounts ofboth his mother's ancestry and his father's, both tracing backto David.  It seems reasonable to assume, therefore, that Jesuswas Semitic.As an interesting aside, Jesus' being semitic makes himneither "white" nor "black," and in some sense underscores thepoint made earlier that his color was not important, it was hismessage, his grace, and his divinity that we should concentrateon.Finally, I would direct anyone interested in Africaninvolvement in the church to the account of the conversion ofthe Ethiopian eunuch in Acts chapter 9 (I think it's chapter9).  This is one of the earliest conversions, and the eunuch,treasurer to the queen of the Ethiopians, was definitelyAfrican.  Because "Ethiopia" at that time indicated a regionjust south of Egypt, many also speculate that this man was notonly the first African Christian, but the first black Christianas well.

It statesclearly that the visitors were angels.  But "all the men from everypart of the city of Sodom--both young and old--surrounded thehouse.  They called to Lot, `Where are the *men* who came to you tonight?  Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.' " For the rest of the story the angels are referred to by the menof Sodom and by Lot as *men*.  Furthermore we know from Gen 18:20,21that the Lord had already found Sodom guilty of grievous sin--beforethe angels visited the city.  It is clear that the grievous sinof Sodom and Gomorrah involved homosexual sex.  It appears thatthe men had become so inflamed in their lust that they hadgroup orgies in the public square--which simply indicates the extremity of their depravity.  It does not show that lesser degrees of homosexuality are not sinful, as Michael would have usbelieve.Ultimately our understanding of God's will for sexuality comes fromthe creation story--not solely on the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.  Hecreated us male and female, and instituted marriage as a relationshipbetween one male and one female, "Therefore a man will leave hisfather and mother, and be united with his wife, and they will becomeone flesh."  This marriage relationship is the only sexualrelationship which God blesses and sanctions. He regulates andprotects the marriage of man and woman, and even uses it as a pictureof the relationship between himself and his church.  But we find notone word of blessing or regulation for a sexual relationship between two men, or between two women.Everything else that we find in the Bible about sexuality derives fromor expresses God's will in instituting and blessing marriage.  Thusthe Levitical code, which was given only to the Jews, forbade incest,homosexuality, bestiality; the Ten Commandments forbade adultery andthe coveting of our neighbor's wife; other commandments forbade rape.The men of Sodom and Gomorrah were regarded as sexually immoral andperverse (Jude 7) because they abandoned and/or polluted the marriagerelationship.  Thus also Paul regarded homosexuality as `unnatural',Romans 1:26,27--not because this was simply Paul's opinion,but because it was contrary to God's purpose in creating usmale and female.

Post it onlyif you think it of general interest.Here is a copy of something I wrote for another list. You mayfind it relevant.A listmember asks: > What makes common-law marriages wrong?A common-law marriage is not necessarily wrong in itself. There isnothing in the Bible (Old or New Testament) about getting married bya preacher, or by a priest (Jewish or Christian). And in fact Jewishpriests have never had any connection with weddings.There is a common notion that the marriage is performed by theclergyman. In fact, the traditional Christian view (at least in theWest) is that the bride and groom are the ministers of the marriage,and that the clergyman is there only as a witness.HOWEVER!The essential ingredient of a marriage is mutual commitment. Twopersons are considered to be married if and only if they have boundthemselves by mutual promises to live together as husband and wife,forsaking all others, till death do them part.      The reason why those who have reason to be concerned about whois married to whom have always insisted on some kind of publicceremony is in order that society, and the couple themselves, may beclear about whether a commitment has been made.Suppose that we do away with the public ceremony, the standard vows,etc. Instead, we have a man and a woman settling down to livetogether.      After a year or so, the man says to the woman: Hey, honey, itwas great while it lasted, but I think it's time to move on.      She says: What are you talking about?      He says: I am leaving you and looking for someone prettier andyounger.      She says: But you can't. We are married!      He says: What are you talking about? We never got married.      She says: I remember distinctly what you said to me the nightwe first made love. You said: "My love for you is as deep as theocean, as eternal as the stars. As long as I live, I am yours,utterly and completely. When I lie on my deathbed, my last feeblebreath will utter your name. My..."      He says: Oh that! That was just rhetoric. Just poetry. When aman is in a romantic mood, he is bound to say all kinds of sillythings like that. You mustn't take them literally.And that is why you have an insistence on a formal ceremony that isa matter of public record.      The Church insists on it, because it is her duty (among otherthings) to give moral advice, and you cannot give a man moral adviceabout his relations with a woman if you have no idea who is marriedto whom, if anybody, and vice versa.      The State insists on it, since the state has a concern withproperty rights, with child care and support, and therefore needs toknow who has made what commitments to whom.      Prospective fathers-in-law insist on it, because they don'twant their daughters seduced and abandoned.      Prospective spouses insist on it, because they want to makesure they know whether what they are hearing is a real commitment,or just "poetry."      And persons making vows themselves insist on making themformally and publicly, in order that they may be clear in their ownminds about what it is that they are doing, and may know themselvesthat this is not just rhetoric. This is the real thing.      Hence the insistence on a formal public explicit avowal of themarriage commitment.  The Church goes further and insists that, whenChristians marry, a clergyman shall be present at the wedding andrecord the vows on behalf of the Church, not because it isimpossible to have a valid wedding without a clergyman, but in orderto make sure that the couple understand what the Christian teachingabout marriage is, and that they are in fact promising to be marriedin a Christian sense. The Church also prefers a standard marriagevow, and is wary of letting couples Write their own vows, for muchthe same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when theydraw up a will or a contract. Certain language has been repeatedlyused in wills, and one can be sure how the courts will interpret it.Try to say the same thing in your own words, and you may find thatthe probate judge's interpretation of them is not at all what youintended.  Similarly, the Church prefers to avoid endless debatesabout whether "You are my main squeeze" and "I am here for the longhaul" do in fact cover the same territory as "forsaking all others"and "till death do us part."      This topic has come up on the list before. (Is there any topicthat hasn't?) One listmember was asking, "If a couple love eachother and are living together, isn't that marriage in the eyes ofGod?" Eventually someone asked, "In that case, what is their statusif they break up? Is that the moral equivalent of getting a divorce?Are they in a relationship that God forbids either of them to walkout on? " The original questioner said: "Good grief, I never thoughtof that!" In fact, there are reasonable grounds for suspecting thatsomeone who says, "We don't need a piece of paper or a ceremony infront of a judge or a preacher in order to show that we love eachother," is trying to have it both ways -- to have the advantages ofmarriage plus the option of changing his mind with a minimum ofbother.At this point someone may say, "None of this applies to me and mymate. We are quite clear on the fact that we have assumed a lifelongcommitment, 'for better or worse, forsaking all others, till deathus do part.' So in our case, no ceremony is needed."     To this my reply would be: The reason for requiring a driver'slicense is to keep dangerous drivers off the road.  What is wrong initself is not the existence of unlicensed drivers, but the existenceof dangerous drivers. However, testing and licensing drivers is anobvious and reasonable means of pursuing the goal of reducing thenumber of dangerous drivers on the road. Therefore the State rightlymakes and enforces such laws, and you the citizen have a positivemoral obligation to refrain from driving without a license no matterhow much of a hotshot behind the wheel you think you are.Back to the original question. We have a listmember who knows acouple who have been living together for around 20 years. He asks:At what point did they stop fornicating and start being married? Ianswer: at the point, if any, where they both definitely andexplicitly accepted an obligation to be faithful to each other, forbetter or worse, as long as they both lived. If they have acceptedsuch an obligation, what are their reasons for not being willing todeclare it in front of, say, a justice of the peace? Yours, James Kiefer

It seems to me that it takes 3 parties to make a marriage:husband-to-be, wife-to-be, and God.  If you promise beforeeach other and God that you will convenant together to bemarried, then...you are (IMO).So why do we have the ceremonial part ?

I was just reading John 14 this morning (I think that is theright chapter, anyway it is close and I don't have a Bible at work tocheck with.) and in it Jesus is talking to his disciples about hisimpending death and he says that he will be going away and then laterhe will be with them.  He said something along the lines of "I willbe in you and you will be in me."  (Again I cannot provide the exactquote or citation.)  Anyway, my understanding of this is thatthe Second Coming will not be an outward event.  It is an inwardevent, Christ will come to live in our hearts and we will live in him.If you look for a person you will be deceived.It seems to me that the Jews had been looking for a Messiah that wouldbe a political or military leader and so didn't recognize Jesus whenhe came.  Jesus tried to show that his Kingdom was not of this earth.A lot of what I have seen written about the Second Coming seems tobased on an expectation of Christ coming back and finally taking overthe world and running it the way it should be.  It sounds a lot likewhat the Jews were looking for.  The First Coming wasn't like that andI see no reason for the Second Coming to be like that either.Oh and by the way, I don't expect it to happen once.  There is no oneSecond Coming, there are a lot of little ones.

First of all looking atthe titles of her other books, I would personally consider her to be engaged in a bizarre form of Christian-like mysticismheavily influenced by eastern philosphies (great titles like _The_Astrology_of_the_4_Horsemen_).However, other than the Chapter One into, there's nothing original,biased, or even new this book.  It is basically a collection of previouslypublished works by those who claim that there exist Buddhist and Hindustories that Christ visited India and China (he was known as Issa) during the period from late teens to age 30.Conclusion:  the book actually lets you come to your own view by presentinga summary of various published works and letters, all of which youcould verify independently.  It includes refutations to such works aswell.  Therefore, even if you think she is theologically warped, this book is a nice reference summary for the interested. -- Rob Butera        |ECE Grad Student  |     "Only sick music makes money today" Rice University   |Houston, TX 77054 |               - Nietzsche, 1888

I don't find anywhere that God restricts heaven to particular   ethnic groups or religious denominations or any other category   that we humans like to drop people into. But He does REQUIRE   that we believe and trust Him. In Hebrews it says that God spoke   of old by the prophets (the old testament), but in these last days   he has spoken to us by His son Jesus Christ. And we learn of   Him through the pages of the New Testament. The Bible tells us   what we need to believe. For those who have never heard, I leave   them in God's capable care, He will make himself known as he   desires. It behooves each one of us to act upon the knowledge   we have. If you reject the claims of Jesus, and still go to   heaven, then the joke's on me. If you reject him and go to hell,   that's no joke, but it will be final.

He had noargument with the pharisees over any of the OT canon (John10.31-6), and explained to his followers on the road to Emmaus that in the law, prophets and psalms which referred to him - the OT division of Scripture (Luke 24.44), as well as in Luke 11.51taking Genesis to Chronicles (the jewish order - we would sayGenesis to Malachi) as Scripture.>See Dr. Lee MacDonald's _The Formation of the Christian Biblical Canon_>(Abingdon, 1988) for a clear and faithful examination of the origins and>issues of the canon.I am not familiar with the book.

Jesus replies that Elijah has come, but they did not recognize him. It then says that the apostles perceived that he was refering toJohn the Baptist. This seems to me to clearly imply reincarnation.

These are books intended for use in undergraduate Bible   courses.  They give historical background, discussion of literary   styles, etc.  And generally they have good bibligraphies for further   reading.  I typically recommend Kee, Froehlich and Young's NT   introduction...Two other Intros to consider:The "Introduction" by Ku:mmel is a translation of a strandard NT text.The references are slightly dated and the style is somewhat dense, butthe book contains a wealth of information.Perrin and Duling's Intro is also very good.  It's somewhat moremodern than Ku:mmel's but not quite so densely packed.  Also theauthors tend to go through the books of the NT in the historical orderof composition; this gives a very useful perspective on thedevelopment of the NT.   ... There are also some good one-volume commentaries.  ... Probably the   best recommendation these days would be Harper's Bible Commentary.A slight dissent: I think the Harper's is "OK" but not great.  Oneparticular problem I have is that it tends to be pretty skimpy onbibliographic material.  My feeling is that it is OK for quicklook-ups, but not real useful for study in depth (e.g. I keep a copyin my office at work).   ... (I think there may be a couple of books with this title...So far as I know there is the only one book with this exact title(James L Mays, general editor, Harper and ROw, 1988) although I thinkI recall a (older) series under the name "Harper Commentaries".  Alsothere's a separate Harper's Bible Dictionary (most of my comments onthe HC also apply to the HBD.)My favorite one-volume commentary is the "New Jerome BiblicalCommentary".  The NJBC is rather Catholic in focus and somewhat biasedtowards the NT.  (The reader can decide for her- or himself whetherthese are pluses or minuses.)  In any case the scholarship is by andlarge excellent.NOTE: The NJBC is a completely reworked, updated version of the"Jerome Biblical Commentary", copies of which can still be found onsale.Nichael

A complete lie willrarely be readily accepted, while a half truth (the lie subtly hidden) is morepowerfully offered by one who masquerades as an angel of light.Satan has (for some people) loosened the grip on treating the earth as somethingother than God's intricate handiwork, something other than that on which thehealth of future generations is based.  It is being treated with respect.  Youthink he's going to happily leave it at that?  No.  When one error is rejected,it is his style to push people to the opposite error.  Therefore the earth isnot God's intricate handiwork, not because it is rubbish, but because it isGod.  Mother earth is the one you are to primarily love and serve.I see two facets of a response to it:1: Care for the environment.  Treat it with proper respect, both because it is   God's intricate handiwork and the health of future generation, and because   showing the facet of one who is disregardful of such things does not   constitute what the Apostle Paul called "becoming all things to all men so   that by all possible means I might save some."   Don't say "Forget the environment, I've got important things to spend my time   on." - putting your foot in your mouth in this manner will destroy your   credibility in expressing the things that _are_ more important.2: Show that it is not the ultimate entity, that it is creature and not   creator.

I agree entirely.  Speaking as an atheist (heterosexual, for what it'sworth), this is one of the least attractive parts of some varieties ofChristianity.  Although I'm sure it's possible to argue theologicallythat we shouldn't make analogies between discrimination on the basisof sex and race and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation,morally the case looks unanswerable (for those outside religion): thethree forms _are_ analogous; we shouldn't discriminate on the basis ofsex, race or sexual orientation.I found the moderator's FAQs on the subject instructive, and recommendeveryone to read them.There seem to be three different levels of acceptance:1) Regard homosexual orientation as a sin (or evil, whatever)2) Regard homosexual behaviour as a sin, but accept orientation(though presumably orientation is unfortunate) and dislike people whoindulge3) As 2, but "love the sinner"4) Accept homosexuality altogether.My experience is that 3 is the most common attitude (I imagine 1 and 2are limited to a few fundamentalist sects).I suppose I can go along with 3, except that I have this feeling thata 14--15 year old living in a community with this attitude, ondiscovering that they were more attracted to members of the same sex,would not feel the love of the community, but would rather feel thepressure not to exhibit their feelings.

For certain persons have crept in unnoticed, those who were long   beforehand marked out for this condemnation, ungodly persons who   turn the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny our only    Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.                                      Jude 4 (NASB)What is defined by God as a legitimate marriage?   For this cause a man shall leave his father and his mother, and   shall cleave to his wife; and the shall become one flesh.                                      Gen 2:24 (NASB)   And He answer and said, "Have you not read, that He who created them   from the beginning MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE, and said, 'FOR THIS    CAUSE A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER, AND CLEAVE TO HIS WIFE;   AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH'?  Consequently they are no longer   two, but one flesh.  What therefore God has joined together, let no   man separate."                                       Matt 19:4-6 (NASB)   But because of immoralities, let each man have his own wife, and let   each woman have her own husband.  Let the husband fulfill his duty   to his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband.                                      1 Corinthians 7:4,5 (NASB)>  There are plenty of>laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of>which Christians ignore completely.

Leviticus 18:19, 20 (NASB)These verses are just as relevant as:   You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an   abomination.                                   Leviticus 18:22 (NASB)Why was God telling the Israelites not to practice such things?   Do not defile yourselves by any of these things; for by all these   the nations which I am casting out before you have become defiled.   For the land has become defiled, therefore I have visited its    punishment upon it, so the land has spewed out its inhabitants.   But as for you, you are to keep My statutes and Judgments, and    shall not do any of these abominations, neither the native, nor   the alien who sojourns among you                                    Leviticus 18:24-26 (NASB)He is the Lord...  Listen to what he has to say... Nobody wants to dismiss homosexuals.  We do love you, but we don't agree that what you practice is not sin.  You have not truly repentedof your sin.  We hate the sin that is within your lives.  I hate sinthat is in my life.  All Christians should hate the sin that is withintheir own lives.  Confrontaion with sin should bring about repentance. Yes I agree with John 3:17, but I also know that Jesus said, "Repent forthe kingdom of heaven is at hand"  Matt 3:17.  If you don't agree thathomosexuality is sin than how can you repent from it?  This means thatyou remain in bondage to it.

If you think otherwise, try to construct a proof thatyesterday happened. Obviously it did; anyone old enough to bereading this was there for it and remembers that it happened.But *proof*? A proof starts with axioms and goes somewhere.You need axioms to talk about logical proof. You can say thatyou remember yesterday, and that you take as axiom that anythingyou clearly remember happened. I could counterclaim that youhallucinated the whole thing.To talk about proofs of historical events, you have to relax theterms a bit. You can show evidences, not proofs. Evidences of theresurrected Jesus exist. Proofs do not.I think Christianity goes down in flames if the resurrection isever disproved. I also think that this will not happen, asthe evidence for the resurrection is quite good as these thingsgo. It is not entirely fair to claim that you can only takethe resurrection on faith. There are reasons to believe itthat appeal to the mind, too.

This is in response to a question aboutthe Immaculate Conception.  I explained it, but left justificationup to our Catholic readers.  --clh]There is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for themention of Mary's _blessedness_/full of grace in the "Annunciation" byAngel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28 And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _"Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women."_Now, now, hold that line of thought - "the Lord is with Mary &blessed art thou among women" - while you read on....In the book, "First Lady of the World, A Popular History ofDevotion to Mary" by Peter Lappin:The _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicatedthan the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possiblethat the feast of _Mary's Conception_ under the title "The Conceptionof Saint Anne", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ ofa woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter,just as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer inemphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracleof grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Maryis the incorruptible timber "out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_of Christ's sinless body"; she is "God's Eden, in whom there isno tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms."  Her perfectbeauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, herpurity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus,she was hailed as "innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate,spotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily fromamong thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve"....At the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan,John Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a greater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from allsin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_....Now let's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin.From "Pocket Catholic Cathechism" by John A. Hardon:Baptism -Concupiscence Remains after Baptism.Concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptizedbut since it is left to provide trial, it has no power toinjure those who do not consent and who by the grace ofChrist Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).Original gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall:In the light of the foregoing, we see that our firstparents were originally gifted three times over:-They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the power to think and to choose freely.-The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires.-They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace, the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding title to enter heaven.By their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural andpreternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (withoutlosing) their natural capacity to reason and to choosefreely.Baptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam'ssin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ giftsbut gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of ourbodies on the last day...Going back to _Immaculate Conception_(I am not sure if this interpretation is in any otherbooks but it may be another contribution to the 'puzzle'):Given the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at anon-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born AND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary's birth butSTILL, the Angel Gabriel's greetings was:"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you.Blessed art thou amongst women".Even Mary was confused about this greeting.Mary could very well have possessed all of the_treefold original gifts above_ given to our firstparents (Adam and Eve before their sin):    Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)    Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)    The Lord is with you (At those times, God would                definitely want to be with those He                has made _blessed_)    Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)At the conception, God made Mary _full of graceand blessed_ as the 'tabernacle' for the coming bodyof Christ and so,Immaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary stillhas maintained her Immaculate Heart. -Marida(P.S.  I do hope that others will continue more       light and facts on this matter.  Thanks.)

Thus I've never really believed in God andheaven, although I don't actually believe that they don't exist either -I'm sort of undecided, probably like a lot of people I guess.        Lately I've been thinking about it all a lot more, and I wondered howreligious people can be so convinced that there is a God. I feel as thoughI want to believe, but I'm not used to believing things without proof -just as I can't believe that there definitely isn't a God, so I can'tdefinitely believe that there is. I wondered if most of you were brought up byreligious families and never believed any different. Can anyone help me tounderstand how your belief and faith in God can be so strong.        Another question that frequently crosses my mind is which religion iscorrect?? How do you choose a religion, and how do you know that the ChristianGod exists and the Gods of other religions don't?? How do you feel aboutpeople who follow other religions?? How about atheists?? And people like me -agnostics I suppose. Do you respect their religion, and accept theirbeliefs as just as valid as your own?? Isn't there contradiction betweenthe religions?? How can your religion be more valid than any others?? Doyou have less respect for someone if they're not religious, or if they followa different religion than you would if they were Christian??        Also, how much of the scriptures are correct?? Are all events inthe bible really supposed to have happened, or are they just supposed to bestories with morals showing a true Christian how to behave??        I generally follow most of the Christian ideas, which I suppose arefairly universal throughout all religions - not killing, stealing, etc, and'Loving my neighbour' for want of a better expression. The only part I findhard is the actual belief in God.        Finally, what is God's attitude to people like me, who don't quitebelieve in Him, but are generally fairly 'good' people. Surely notbelieving doesn't make me a worse person?? If not, I find myself wondering whyI so strongly want to really believe, and to find a religion.        Sorry if I waffled on a bit - I was just writing ideas as they cameinto my head. I'm sure I probably repeated myself a bit too.

This is misleading, at best.  The question, really, has to do with thestatus of the Greek Septuagint versus Hebrew scripture.  And the issuepredates the Reformation by quite a bit -- Jerome was negative about the"deuteroncanonicals" and in fact, even though he transalted them, he putthem after the Hebrew canon (reordered from the Greek ordering to theHebrew one.)  His translations of them were quick-and-dirty, also (hereports having done one of them in one day, and another overnight, justdictating his translation to an amanuensis.That is to say, it is the Vulgate, and all of its massive importance inWestern Christianity, along with the veneration of Jerome, which took thefirst steps in "reducing" these books from the status they had (and have)among the Greeks.Furthermore, it is inaccurate to say that the Reformers "threw out" thesebooks.  Basically, they just placed them in a secondary status (as Jeromehad already done), but with the additional warning that doctrine shouldnot be based on citations from these ALONE.I think that the emphasis on the Hebrew originals is sound, though itseems somewhat arbitrary to disallow on the face of it a translation aspart of a collection whose principles of selection (in Hebrew or Greek)are confused or unknown and likely fraught with accident.  It also seemsto play into a tendentious notion of the original languages being somehow"more inspired" -- as if magical, and conveying a message untranslatable-- than a translation, as if we could not hear God's word to the Jews inGreek (or German, or English, ...).  This tendency seems to have got abig boost in _sola scriptura_ Protestantism, even to the point of current"inerrancy" bizarreness, despite the more basic, underlying tendency ofthe Reformers to see that the texts SHOULD and COULD be translated.  Ifwe can profit from an English rendering of Hebrew and Greek, there issurely little reason to keep Sirach, at least, out of our Bibles (and ofcourse, Anglicans don't do so :-)).  For texts originally in Greek, itwould seem more to be anti-Greek prejudice (notably, by the time theHebrew canon is fully attested, including anti-Christian prejudice whichled to the Jewish abandonment of the Septuagint) which is operative.BTW: readers may enjoy some lectures of Bruce Metzger on the issues oftranslation of the Bible (including some of what I said about Jerome,above) in the current numbers of the journal _Bibliotheca Sacra_; twoof four have been published so far.-- Michael L.

How do you (Mormons) reconcile>the idea of eternal marriage with Christ's statement that in the ressurection>people will neither marry nor be given in marriage (Luke, chapt. 20)?Well, here is something I wrote some time ago in response to asimilar question.  I hope it helps:[Begin repeat of previous post]As for the scripture mentioned I agree that it does seem to be a problem, not only for eternal marriage but marriage in general.  Luke's version has Jesus saying that the children of this world marry and are given in marriage but not those who will attainthe kingdom of heaven.  It almost sounds like marriage disqualifiesone for salvation.  (Matthew and Mark both omit this statement.)   Ithink the accounts are not as clear as they might be.  Let's have alook at the incident and see if we can come up with some reasonableideas of what it means.  The scriptures involved are Mat 22:23-30,Mark 12:18-25, and Luke 20:27-36.What happened was that the Sadducees, who did not believe in theresurrection, thought they could trap Jesus.  They made reference tothe "Leverite" marriage which required the brother of a man who diedwithout children to take the widow to wife and raise up children.  The children would be considered children of the deceased, just asthough the woman's first husband had fathered them.  It seemsobvious from this that the woman was still considered in a way to bethe wife of her first husband.  However, the Sadducees concocted ascene in which 6 brothers of the deceased each in his turn failed tofather children by the widow.  They seem to imply that the Leveritemarriage was equal to the first for they ask, "Whose wife shall shebe in the resurrection?"  At this point it seems obvious that if sheis anybody's wife, it is the first husband.  After all, had sheborne children they would have been credited to him regardless ofwhich brother was the biological father.  It is possible Jesus wasrefering to this when he says, "Ye do err, not knowing thescriptures or the power of God." (Mat 22:29, compare Mark 12:24,phrase not in Luke's account).Anyway, the Sadducees ask, "Whose wife will she be in theresurrection, seeing that all 7 had her?"  Jesus answer is that,"In the resurrection they neither marry nor are given inmarriage..." (Mat 22:30) "When they rise from the dead they neithermarry..." (Mark 12:25)  "They which are accounted worthy to obtainthat world neither marry..." (Luke 20:35)  All 3 accounts go on tosay, "but are as the angels in heaven" or the equivalent.  I findthis last not very helpful since the Bible does not define angelsnor give any idea what their life is like.  (Some ministers claimthat they are sexless, different that humans etc. but I can find noBiblical support for this.)I think what Jesus is saying here (and it is clearest in Matthew'sand Mark's accounts) is that marriages will not be performed in theresurrection.  This goes along with our belief that if a person isto marry at all it must be done on this earth.  However, we dobelieve that a marriage performed by the authority of God can bebinding in eternity.  In fact, the first marriage appears to havebeen performed by God himself before death entered the world (in theGarden of Eden).  What therefore God hath joined together, let notman put asunder. (Mat 19:6)  Jesus also told Peter and the otherapostles that whatsoever they should bind on earth should be boundin heaven (Mat 16:19, 18:18).  I believe that this also refers tomarriages performed by the proper authority.

Many pagans are involved in environmentalism--this is only natural, sincerespect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations.  Thisdoesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace inthe Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.  Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians shouldaddress this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Likeit or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be,and isn't.    I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity hasforgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that wehave something to learn from the pagan movement.  First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history ofoppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable tolive in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ could have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a greatdeal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the male-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who havehad to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.  Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with greatramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundingsand our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a longtradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppressand deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of humanexperience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.  Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganismis an attractive option.  I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.)should be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic ofsexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderatedsexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.Alan Terlep    "Incestuous vituperousness"Oakland University, Rochester, MIatterlep@vela.acs.oakland.edu   --Melissa EggertsenRushing in where angels fear to tread.

I attended DTF III last year, and plan to go again thisyear.  I would recommend it highly to Catholic interested inapologetics.  There will be lots of music, well-known Catholic speakers,fellowship, as well as Eucharistic Liturgies Friday and Sunday.   Registration is $85 per person, but I believe financial aid isavailable if you need it.  Housing in residence halls (each of which hasits own Blessed Sacrament chapel), if desired, is $30/person for doubleoccupancy for two nights ($30 total). Reservations can also be made foryou at the very nearby Holiday Inn.  I think it was $47 a night therefor my single room.  Meals are available at the cafeteria (Friday dinnerthrough Sunday lunch) for $38 or $32, with or without breakfast,respectively.   Franciscan University of Steubenville is located in eastern Ohio onUS Route 22, 1/2 mile west of the Ohio River and Ohio Route 7.  GreaterPittsburgh International Airport is less than one hour (35 miles) fromcampus.   Feel free to e-mail me if you have any question I can answer.   Here is the agenda, as typed in by a friend of mine:Friday afternoon special:Reflections on C.S. Lewis, a preliminary session with Walter Hooper.Walter Hooper is one of the foremost international experts on thewritings of C.S. Lewis.  In 1963, he served as secretary to C.S. Lewis,and he has since edited 18 of Lewis' literary works for publication.Walter was ordained a priest in the Church of England in 1965, servingin Oxford, England, until he entered the Catholic Church in 1988.----------------Friday evening, opening session:In Search of the Truth: Finding the Fullness of FaithBishop Fabian Bruskewitz.Know Your RitesKimberly Hahn.-------------------Saturday MorningApologetics Means Never Having to Say You're SorryKarl KeatingC.S.

Major Catholic doctrines are misunderstood andattacked.  Like never before, believers need to know the reasons behindthe Catholic Church's teaching.  As our first pope urged: "Always beready to give a defense for the hope that is within you" (I Peter 3:15).

Of course, the next step is, "I don't believe in Hell either, so why will Ibe there?"  It seems to me that Hell is eternal death and seperation from God.Most atheists do believe that when they die they will die forever, and neversee God--so they do, in fact, believe that they're going to Hell.  Hell doesn't have to be worse than earth to be Hell--because it's eternal, and it's a lot worse than Heaven.

It happenedin La Salle, France.The moral lesson of the story is:The Lamb of God has been sacrificed and His blood has been used to cleanse us of our sins every moment as God perceivesworthy of being done in Heaven.  Mary weeps for The Lamb andfor the rest of her offsprings.  This will continue while we disobey God or sin against Him.  Mary, as a messenger, has been given the task to make us be 'aware' of the evilserpent (communism, wars, famine, unfaithful, disobedienceto God, etc.) running after the rest of her offsprings.   The children who went astray by disobedience led by the dragon is brought back by her peace and loving messages, reparations for sins, to obey God's commandments and be more worthy to be in the presence of The Lamb.As she was conceived without sin to be worthy of bearing theSon of God in her womb, Mary has been preparing us, the Church,the Body of Christ, for His second coming (making sure we are protected from the dragon).  Also, she has been preparing the new Eden, by reversing the deed of the ancient Eve.  The new Eden will bethe sanctuary of the righteous as judged by Christ in Hisnext coming.    I relate the story again:    I believe this and Mary, in one of her apparitions      in 19th or 20th century, she appeared to these          two children who tends goats and cows (I forgot         the exact place).  She was  weeping and telling the     children that she is afraid she's "going to lose her    Son's arm".  She is mourning too for these              townfolks because it was their fault that there         would be drought in their harvest; not much good        food again this year as it was last year.                                                                       Mary tells the children:                            *    Most of the townfolks in this place worked whole    **    week even on Sundays when they should be in church  **    honoring God.  These townfolks swears and           **    uses her Son's name in bad words.  That is          *    why her Son's arm is so heavy in pain.                  Then she asked them if they pray.  The children         said "hardly".  She asked them to pray every            morning and night.  When the children went back         from work they had to tell somebody about this.         When the news was spred and after thorough          *    investigation of the incident, the townfolks        **    were converted and faith and obedience to God       **    were restored in their community.                   *Once again, the Lamb succeeds.-Marida  "...spreading God's words through actions..."    -Mother Teresa

God gave her the grace to avoid sin,thus when she was visited by Gabriel, she gave her fiat, her totalacceptance of God's will.  This fiat summarizes why Catholics regard her as the highest of all humans, that God chose her and that sheaccepted.  Knowing this in advance, we extrapolate that she wasneither stained by nor subject to original sin.God did create us all miraculously free to choose or not choose to sin."Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof and the grace of God tocommand it."  This amount of grace was precisely determined by Godto be the amount required to do what God asked of her.  The gracegiven to each of us is also enough, but we do not always chooseto accept it.  We also believe Jesus was fully human and neversinned.  God could have created a much better person than myself, one whoalways chose the right thing, yet he created me instead, despitemy flaws.  He proves he loves me as I am, continually drawing metowards perfection.  For whatever purpose he has for me, he hasconfidence that I will accomplish it.

I have heard his voice -- not audibly (though some have), butclearly nonetheless.  Is what I heard equivalent to Scripture?  No.  I havenever heard contemporary prophets claim that what they receive from theLord is on the same level as Scripture; on the contrary, those who aremature obey the Scriptures by submitting their prophecies to fellowbelievers for judgement.  And the most reliable yardstick for judgingprophecies is, certainly, the Scriptures themselves.

Do you spank your kids?     I don't call it spanking, but they do, so yes, very rarely.>3.  If so how often?     I don't call it spanking because it's more of a reaction to somethingvery dangerous, such as trying to stick their finger in a fan or runninginto the road.  Maybe 3-4 times for each except for the 2YO girl, who hasnot been spanked yet.     They call it that because it *does* hurt their feelings, and of courseI give all the hugs and stuff to ensure they know they're still loved.>4.  Do you use an implement to spank with?     No, that would be too painful.  If it's too traumatic they never recallwhy they were punished.  Besides, it must be immediate, and taking the timeto go get a toolmeans you're not doing it right away, and that lessens theimpact.  It's very emotional for a child as it is - which is evidenced by thefact that a little slap on the rear - which hurts for perhaps 5 seconds -is called a spanking.>>5. If you do not spank, what method of discipline do you use?     Lots of logical consequences - for instance, when 4YO Matthew dareda good friend to jump out of his treehouse or he would push him out, I madesure they didn't play together for 5 days so he'd know that would make himlose friends very quickly.  He's never done anything like that since.     We also use time-out in their rooms - I use a timer so they don't keeparguing with me over leaving, since it's hard to argue with a macine.I will go to the closed door and tell them timeout won't be over until theycalm down if they're too tantrumy.

I hope you can use this toteach all parents that physical punishment isn't always required - parents usethat as an excuse to hit too hard.>9.  How ere you disciplined as a kid     Lots of timeouts, same as I use.  Our family and my husband's have neverused spankings.  In fact, my grandmother in law was one of 11 kids, and theywere almost never spanked.  This was around the turn of the century.  And,none of us has ever been afoul of the law - man-made or God's law.     Jesus says, referring to a small child whom he is holding, that "whatye do to the least of these, ye do also to me."  The Bible also says in allthings to be kind, and merciful, and especially loving. (Colossians 3:12-15.)There is no room for selfish anger, which I'll admit I've been tempted withat times.  When I've felt like spanking hard in anger, maybe the kid deserveda little slap on the rear, but what I would have given would have been thedevil's work.  I could feel the temptation, and just angrily ordered the kidto his/her room and went to my room myself.

Jewish history as recorded in the Old Testament andas shown by archaeology are the same.  Kings, revivals, Temples, and all.The Torah, as far as I know, is the five books of Moses.  Then come theProphets (all the Prophets, plus Joshua, Judges, 1&2 Samuel, 1&2 Kings)and the Writings (Psalms, Proverbs, Lamentations, Ruth, Esther, Ezra,Nehemiah, Ecclesiates, Song of Songs, 1&2 Chronicles, Job).And the veracity of Isaiah, which you quoted to your Moslem friend isquite well known.  A complete manuscript exists that dates back to past200 BC, and is kept in a Museum in Israel.  It was found among the DeadSea Scrolls, which greatly enhanced our knowledge of the veracity of theOld Testament, as they date back to around the time of Christ, whereasbefore, the oldest complete manuscript in Hebrew was from around 900 AD.Your Moslem friend is sorely mistaken, but understandably so.  If Jesuswas crucified, and atoned for our sins, he must have been God, for onlythe death of God could atone for the sins of all humanity.  And asIsaiah predicts, the messiah will be called "the mighty God."  And if hewas God, then he must have rose, for as St. Paul wrote, it was notpossible that death could hold him.  And if Jesus rose from the dead,your Moslem friend would have little reason to be a Moslem.  Which iswhy he denies the authenticity of the Old Testament.Andy Byler

I wrote that human brains "areinfested with sin", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.In reply, Mr Boundary wrote:> I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience> can be trusted virtually ALL the time.Which just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if yourconscience is properly formed?The only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging theformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be surethat your conscience is `properly formed' if you assume that your evaluationcan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I'llgrant, but it's not a valid way of reasoning.Unless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot becertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is`properly formed'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)Mr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:> Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the> infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          > Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.The Church is `by necessity' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?How do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument oranother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?You write:> Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our> competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our> ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas> not subject to the experimental method. But there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability todistinguish what is true from what is not true' and `infallible'.  I amconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long wayfrom `confident'.This discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain issignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say thatyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.Except in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutelycertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have anyidea of his own fallibility.I have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source oftruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All ofthem -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.The result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to theoriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original posterregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wronganswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternalconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he isat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this arefallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But thesebasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it'sunlikely that I'm misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level ofconfidence, I've tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully asto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven't, forexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,and I haven't attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have afeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant andintolerant even though I acknowledge that I'm fallible and so there'ssome chance I'm wrong.Don't get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogantChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at leastsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.If the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences forcertain decisions, it's not my fault -- I'm just telling it the way Ithink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up thatway.  It's one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it mostdifficult to respond to.  But it's not arrogance for me to tell whatI think is the truth.--clh]

If he meant that whatever exists musthave been created, then he is open to the obvious retort that Godexists, and so God must have been created.Perhaps your friend meant that we exist now but that there was atime when we did not exist, and therefore something other thanourselves must have brought us into existence.

He would have some supportfrom philosophers who are not ordinarily considered religious (AynRand, and some others who are in the tradition of Aristotle). Havingargued for a First Cause, he would have to bridge the gap betweensaid entity and the God of Abraham. If he merely asserts that thethings we observe are ultimately dependent on things radicallyunlike them, few physicists would disagree. Yours, James Kiefer

Random Misconfigured SiteLines: 42Approved: christian@aramis.rutgers.eduA "new Christian" wrote that he was new to the faith and learning about it "by reading the Bible, of course". I am notat all sure this is the best path to follow.While the Bible is, for Christians, the word of God, the revelation of God is Jesus Christ and the chief legacy of thisrevalation is the Church. I am not recommending any onedenommination, but I do recommend finding a comfortable christiancongregation in which to develop your faith, rather than justreading the Bible.This does not mean that the Bible should not be read, althoughI would stick to the Gospels, epistles, and Psalms and avoid theBook of Revelation altogether [until you are with friends you arecomfortable with]. I am sure that mistakenly fervent  projects toread the entire Bible have frequently bogged down with a remarkablelack of fervour somewhere in the middle of Leviticus, or for the reallysturdy, somewhere in Chronicles.The point is that the Bible is their to illustrate the Faithof Christians, but does not provide the totality of that faith. Vitalbeliefs of virtually all Christians are simply not mentioned -the Trinity, the duality of natures in Christ, types of Churchorganization. All these beliefs and practices have developed from thelived experience of the Christian people, an experience lived onehopes in the Spirit. As such the Bible, I think, is better studiesin the context of a congregation, and the context of other reading.Following up on a suggestion of an old confessor of mine, I would even suggest that a good novel is a good way to reflect on thechristian life. [Most novels of any profundity are actually discussingthe nature of good and evil in the human heart]. My own induction intothe christian faith was brought about [after grace] through readingGraham Greene: _The Power and the Glory_ and the poetry of GerardManley Hopkins. I would also recommend Graham Greene's _MonsignorQuixote_ and any novel by Iris Murdoch. The last is not even a Christian,but such is her insistence on the need for the good life, that, frankly,I often am more uplifted and God directed after reading her than afterreading many parts of the Bible. And that after all is what beinga Christian is all about: letting your soul and your life be, insome way, directed towards the infinite, represented to us bythe person of Jesus Christ.Paul HalsallHalsall@murray.fordham.edu

Chance would have it that "my weekend" with my daughter has fallen upon Easter Weekend this year.Although I am Presbyterian, I had married a Catholic woman. We decidedthat the Catholic moray of indoctrination of the spouse into the faithwas too confining (and restrictive due to time as we had already set adate), and we were married in a Christian Church which was non-denominational.During the years of our marriage, we did not often attend church. When our daughter was born, some years later, my wife insisted that she be baptised as Catholic. This wasn't a problem with me.During a separation of five years, my ex-wife was taken ill with a diseasethat affected her mental capacities. She was confined to a mental ward fortwo months before it was diagnosed. It has since been treated "effectively".In other words, professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society.During the recuperation, my ex-wife has embraced Buddism. Her influence overmy daughter has been substantial, and has primarily allowed me only Saturdayvisitation for a number of years. During this period I have read Bible studybooks to my daughter, and tried to keep her aware of her Christian heritage.Last fall, our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings.At that time I was awarded visitation rights every other weekend. At that time,I started taking my daughter to church quite often, although not every weekend.I did this to attempt to strengthen the Christian ethic and expose her to areligious community.Today, Easter Sunday, I took my daughter to church. When it came time for Communion, my daughter took the bread (The body of Christ) but left the wine(The blood of Christ) professing that she was too young for wine. She thenballed the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under thepew in front of us.I feel this was a slap in the face to me, my religion, and an afront to herreligious heritage. It can be construed as breaking several of the commandmentsif you try. I really felt dishonored by the action.My daughter is only nine years old, but I think she should have been old andmature enough to realize her actions. I have difficulty blaming her directlyfor religious teachings her mother swears to, but when I discussed this withmy daughter she made it clear she believed in Buddhism and not Christianity.My initial response of anger (moderated) was to suggest if there is no faithin Christ then why does she celebrate Easter, or Christmas? I suggested Iwould never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidayswith her again.I do not want to "drive her from the fold", and would be willing to allow herto continue practicing Buddhism (as though I had a choice seeing her onlyfor two days out of fourteen) but I want her to want to embrace Christianity.Any suggestions?If you have a response, please e-mail me a copy.

A person from Jesus' culture authorizedto conduct business "in John's name" had full authority over John'sfinancial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation towork only for John's benefit and consonant with John's wishes.  It wasnot required for the steward to preface each business transaction with"in John's name"; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorneyand be operating in good faith. (Note the overlap here between legaland religious definitions of "faith".)With this cultural background, praying "in Jesus' name" does notmandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that thepetitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous"fiduciary" relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of HisKingdom.  The message of "praying in Jesus' name" is thus closelyaligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God'sdelegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources andresponsibilities.  This idea of praying "in Jesus' name" is not onlypresent but prominent in the Lord's Prayer, although the verbalforumula is absent.The act of praying the words "In Jesus' Name" may be beneficial ifthey cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to theadvancement of God's Kingdom.  For that reason, I'm not quite readyto say that the praying the formula is without meaning.Prayers to God for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving,etc.) don't seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered byChristian or non-Christian, whether B.C. or A.D. (that's B.C.E. orC.E. for you P.C. :-).  I don't see anything in Christ's words tocontradict the idea that God deals with all prayers according to Hisomniscience and grace.Van Kellyvek@research.att.comThe above opinions are my own, and not those of AT&T.

My comments are basedprimarily on William Rusch's historical summary in "The TrinitarianControversy", Fortress.  I'm going to save this as an FAQ.  --clh]MAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY [SECOND CENTURYThe writers of the 2nd Cent. are important, because they set up muchof the context for the later discussions.  Justin Martyr, Aristides,Athenagoras, Tatian, and Theophilus of Antioch are known as the"Apologists".  Their theology has often been described as "Logostheology".  Based strongly on wording in John, they took more or lessa two-phase approach.  Through eternity, the Logos was with theFather, as his mind or thought.  This "immanent Word" became"expressed" as God revealed himself in history, ultimately in Jesus.Thus Jesus' full distinction from the Father only became visible inhistory, though the Logos had been present in God from eternity.Rusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of thefinal orthodox position, but in a form which is less sophisticated,because it did not have the technical language to properly deal withthe eternal plurality in the Godhead.Irenaeus held views somewhat similar to the Apologists.  However hewas uncomfortable with the two-stage approach.  He still viewed God asone personage, with distinctions that did not become fully visibleexcept through his process of self-revelation (the "economy").  Thedistinctions are present in his essential nature.  Irenaeus emphasizedthe Holy Spirit more than the Apologists.  Irenaeus' views shouldprobably be called "economic trinitarianism", though that term isnormally used (as below) to refer to later developments.THIRD CENTURY--clh]Dynamic Monarchianism Source: TheodotusAdherents: Paul of Samosota, Artemon, Socinus, Modern UnitariansPerception of God's Essence: The unity of God denotes both oneness of natureand oneness of person. The Son and the Holy Spirit therefore areconsubstantial with the Father's divine essence only as impersonal attributes.The divine dunamis came upon the man Jesus, but he was not God in the strictsense of the word.Perception of God's Subsistence: The notion of a subsistent God is a palpableimpossibility, since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible. The'diversity' of God is apparent and not real, since the Christ event and thework of the Holy Spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within God, not toa hypostatic union.Asignation of Deity/Eternality: Father: Unique originator of the universe. He is eternal, self-existent, andwithout beginning or end. Son: A virtuous (but finite) man in whose life God was dynamically present ina unique way; Christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified. Holy Spirit: An impersonal attribute of the Godhead. No deity or eternalityis ascribed to the Holy Spirit.Criticism(s): Elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelationconcerning the Trinity. Categorically denies the deity of Christ and of theHoly Spirit, thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblicaldoctrine of salvation.[In summary, this probably best thought of as not being Trinitarianismat all.  God is an undifferentiated one.  Son and Holy Spirit are seenas simply names for the man Jesus and the grace of God active in theChurch.  --clh] Modalistic Monarchianism Source: PraxeasAdherents: Noatus, Sabellius, Swedenborg, Scleiermacher, United Pentecostals(Jesus Only)Perception of God's Essence: The unity of God is ultra-simplex. He isqualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person.  Thisessence may be designated interchangeably as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.They are different names for but identical with the unified, simplex God. Thethree names are the three modes by which God reveals Himself.Perception of God's Subsistence: The concept of a subsistent God is erroneousand confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of God's modalistic manifestingof himself. The paradox of a subsisting "three in oneness" is refuted byrecognizing that God is not three persons but one person with three differentnames and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama.Asignation of Deity/Eternality: Father: Fully God and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation ofthe only unique and unitary God Son: Full deity/eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being anothermode of the one God and identical with his essence. he is the same Godmanifested in temporal sequence specific to a role (incarnation). Holy Spirit: Eternal God only as the tile designates the phase in which theone God, in temporal sequence, manifested himself pursuant to the role ofregeneration and sanctification.Criticism(s): Depersonalizes the Godhead. To compensate for its Trinitariandeficiencies, this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical. Itsconcept of successive manifestations of the Godhead cannot account for suchsimultaneous appearances of the three persons as at Christ's baptism.[Rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy.  There areactually two slightly different groups included: Noetus and hisfollowers, and Sabellius.  Noetus was apparently more extreme.Sabellius followed him, and attempted to use some features of economicTrinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view.  Unfortunately,information about Sabellius comes from a century later, and thereseems to be some confusion between him and Marcellus of Ancyra. --clh] [I've moved the following description to be with the otherthird-century views.  It originally appeared near the end.  --clh]"Economic" Trinitarianism Source: Hippolytus, TertullianAdherents: Various "neo-economic" TrinitariansPerception of God's Essence: The Godhead is characterized by triunity: Father,Son, and Holy Spirit are the three manifestations of one identical,indivisible substance. The perfect unity and consubstantiality are especiallycomprehended in such manifest Triadic deeds as creation and redemption.Perception of God's Subsistence: Subsistence within the Godhead is articulatedby means of such terms as "distinction" and "distribution" dispellingeffectively the notion of separateness or division.Asignation of Deity/Eternality:The equal deity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is clearly elucidated inobservation of the simultaneous relational/operational features of theGodhead. Co-eternality, at times, does not intelligibly surface in thisambiguous view, but it seems to be a logical implication.Criticism(s): Is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of therelational aspect of the Trinity.[Note that this is a development of the Apologists and Irenaeus, asmentioned above.  As with them, the threeness is visible primarily inthe various ways that God revealed himself in history.  However theydid say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehowpresent in the Godhead from the beginning.  Tertullian talks ofthe Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as being three that are one insubstance.  Many people regard this view as being essentiallyorthodox, but with less developed philosophical categories.  --clh][Origen, developing further an approach started by Clement, attemptedto apply neo-Platonism to Christian thought.  He set many of the termsof the coming battle.  In Platonic fashion, he sees the Son as amediator, mediating between the absolute One of God and the pluralityof creating beings.  The Son is generated, but he is "eternallygenerated".  That is, the relationship between Father and Son iseternal.  It cannot be said that "there was once when he was not" (aphrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries).  Having the Sonis intrinsic to his concept of God.  The Father and Son are describedas separate "hypostases", though this may not have quite the meaningof separate subsistence that it had in some contexts.  The union isone of love and action, but there is some reason to think that he mayhave used the term homoousios ("of the same substance").  The HolySpirit is also an active, personal substance, originated by the Fatherthrough the Son.  Origen's intent is trinitarian, not tritheistic, buthe pushes things in the direction of separateness.FOURTH CENTURY--clh]Subordinationism  [often called Arianism --clh] Source: AriusMajor Adherents: Modern Jehovah's Witnesses, and several other lesser knowncultsPerception of God's Essence: The inherent oneness of God's nature is properlyidentifiable with the Father only. The Son and the Holy Spirit are discreetentities who do not share the divine essence.Perception of God's Subsistence: The unipersonal essence of God precludes theconcept of divine subsistence with a Godhead. "Threeness in oneness" is self-contradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic God.Asignation of Deity/Eternality: Father: The only one, unbegotten God who is eternal and without beginning. Son: A created being and therefore not eternal. Though he is to be venerated,he is not of the divine essence. Holy Spirit: A nonpersonal, noneternal emanation of the Father. He is viewedas an influence, an expression of God.  Deity is not ascribed to him.Criticism(s): It is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respectingthe deity of both Christ and the Holy Spirit. Its hierarchial concept likewiseasserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the Father, Christ,and the Holy Spirit. This results in a totally confused soteriology.[Note also that in most versions of this view, the Son is not fullyhuman either.  He is supernatural and sinless.  That distinguishes thisview from adoptionism.  --clh] Orthodox Trinitarianism Source: AthanasiusAdherents: Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, Augustine, ThomasAquinas, Luther, Calvin, Contemporary orthodox ChristianityPerception of God's Essence: God's being is perfectly unified and simplex: ofone essence.  This essence of deity is held in common by Father, Son, and HolySpirit. The three persons are consubstantial, coinherent, co-equal, and co-eternal.Perception of God's Subsistence: The divine subsistence is said to occur inthree modes of being or hypostases. As such, the Godhead exists "undivided individed persons." This view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperationin function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the Godhead.Asignation of Deity/Eternality:In its final distillation, this view unhesitatingly sets forth Father, Son,and Holy Spirit as co-equal and co-eternal in the Godhead with regard to boththe divine essence and function.Criticism(s): The only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent inhuman language and thought itself: the impossibility of totally describing theineffable mystery of "three in oneness."[At least in the 4th Cent, there were several different approaches, allof which fit the description here, and all regarded as orthodox, but whichare somewhat different in detail.  Nicea was originally held to respondto Arius.  Arius can be thought of as carrying Origen's thought a bittoo far, to the point of making the Son a separate entity.  In generalthe East tended to take an approach based on Origen's, and it was hardto get acceptance of Nicea in the East.  Its final acceptance wasbased on the work of Athanasius with the Cappadocians: Gregory of Nyssa andGregory of Nazianzus, among others.  While starting with three,they show that their unity in nature and and action is such that onemust think of them as being a single God.  This allowed the Councilof Constantinople, in 381, to get wide agreement on the idea ofthree hypostatese and one ousia.  --clh]Adapted from _Charts of Christian Theology and Doctrine_, by H.

As any knowledgable person should know, Christianityhas been used in this country to tighten the spiritual, emotional, & mentalhold slavery placed on the minds, souls & hearts of African-Americans.

And as forsaying that "it doesn't matter..."  to a member of a physically emancipatedpeople who is still struggling for MENTAL emancipation, believe me:  ITMATTERS.[The general attack on the members of this group seems unjustified.There has been discussion of this issue in the past.  We can't discusseverything at once, so the fact that some specific thing hasn't beendiscussed recently shouldn't be taken as a sign of general cowardice,arrogance or apathy.  In past discussions no one has been outraged bysuggestions that Jesus could be black (and it has been suggested by afew scholars), but the concensus is that he was most likely Semitic.As you probably know, there is a tradition that portrayals of Jesus inart tends to show him as one of the people.  Thus you wouldn't besurprised to find African art showing him as black, and oriental artshowing him as oriental.  There are good reasons relating to Christiandevotion to think of him in such a way.  It's also good now and thento have that image challenged, and to think of Jesus as being a memberof XXX, where XXX is the group you least respect.  --clh]

DeYoungwrites, _in abstractu_:>this study argues that Paul coined the term arsenokoitai, deriving it>from the LXX of Lev 20:12 (cf. 18:22) and using it for homosexual>orientation and behavior[it is only a minor point, but let me make it anyway; De Young hasalready contradicted his own prior assertion in this abstract thatthe ancient analysis of these issues was concerned with actions andNOT with orientation.  I doubt this will have much bearing on thearticle as such, but thought I should point it out from the start.]The hypothesis De Young is advancing is that Paul a) coined the word andb) his intended meaning for it was in reference to the Levitical law.  Thequestions I wish to raise are1.)  how would one go about confirming the truth of this hypothesis?and2.)  what follows if one accepts (or stipulates, for the sake of the     discussion) that it is correct?Note that b) is independent of a); I consider b) far more plausible than a),which seems merely to be a counsel of despair over finding nothing in theliterature contemporary with Paul to clarify this word.  So far as I know,Paul does NOT in general invent words anywhere else in his letters.  Unlessyou have an otherwise-established pattern of coinages, it is *not* soundmethodology to assume it -- particularly if he gives no hint in the immedi-ate text to "fix" the coinage's meaning for his audience.As yet, the extract presents no evidence at all.  What do we need to confirmor reject the hypothesis? (which, I should say at the outset, I find somewhatplausible; I certainly know of nothing which makes it an *impossible* wayof construing this problem passage.)  I'm going to set aside for the momentthe question of whether Paul might have coined this usage, to look at themore tractable question of what it means.  For this there are, in principle,two kinds of evidence that can be adduced, internal and external.  That is,we can look at the text of Paul's letter for clarification or look outsidethat to prior or contemporary writings that Paul might have relied on, or toderivative writings that have some claim of access to Paul's meaning.The single WORST problem with this word in Corinthians is that there IS nointernal evidence for Paul's meaning.  He uses the word totally without anexplanation or hint as to his meaning, save that its inclusion in a list ofnegatives implies that it has for him SOME negative meaning.We are left, as the only "internal" clue, with the etymology or formationof the word -- which is indeed the reason that De Young (and others beforehim) have associated it with the Leviticus prohibition of men VERBing withother men, where VERB is some standard euphemism for having sex ("lie" inLeviticus, "bed" in Greek).  One problem is that "bedders" (_-koitai_) isnot, as far as I know, USED that way in Greek.  THEREFORE, I offer oneserious test which de Young's hypothesis *must* pass or be rejected:o  find a body of Greek texts contemporary with Paul (or not much   prior to his day) such that the _X-koitai_ formation implies   "men who have sex with X"  [obviously, the "best case" is to   find such usages of _arsenokoitai_ itself.]such texts would be confirmation that the word *can* be read that way.It is worth emphasizing that compound words are NOT in general under-standable by projecting what the READER may imagine by the juxtapositionof the roots.  Existence of such parallels doesn't *prove* the hypothesiscorrect -- but it goes a long way towards making such a usage (whether ornot original with Paul in the specific case of X == _arse:n_) possibleof comprehension by his readers.My "test" moves in the direction of external evidence.  If Paul does NOTin his text explain his word (and he does not), then he has to expect hisreaders to already know the word (which stands against its being a coinage)or to expect that it mimics word formations that they *do* know, such thatthey can guess his meaning without too much floundering.External evidence, that is, texts other than Paul's own and lexicographicor social/historical considerations that might be adduced, then come intothe picture.  *If* there are other uses of the word, not dependent on Paul,which *have* sufficient internal (contextual) evidence -- or some gloss bya contemporary scribe -- to show a derogatory reference to male homosexu-ality, or similar _-koitai_ formations used in similar ways, *then* onehas grounds foro  denying that Paul coined the wordando  assuming that his readers might understand his meaningDo you see the problem?  If Paul coined the word, then he REQUIRES hisreaders to share enough context with him to COMPREHEND his coinage andits intent -- in this case that they would (stipulating De Young's guess)understand him to be referring to the Levitical "universal" prohibitionof male-male sex (this, mind you, in a context where Paul has emphasizedat least to OTHER congregations (and so one assumes to the Corinthians --how else to explain 1 Cor. 6:12, and the Corinthians having to be pulledback from overinterpreting their freedom?) the NON applicability of Torahlaw to his gentile converts!)Among the considerations that make it implausible for Paul to have coinedthe word, its first element is archaic -- _arse:n_ is an old Attic orIonic form of what in even classical (let alone koine) times would beassimilated as _arre:n_.  To me, this implies that we are even more thanusually needful of external evidence to pin down meaning and usage.  Whatis Paul doing inventing a word in obsolete Attic formation?And if he *didn't* coin the word, but picked it up like the others inhis list as common terms of derogation, then his meaning will be -- forhis readers -- constrained by that common meaning (since he gives noother.)I cannot emphasize enough that Paul DOES NOT TELL US what he means bythis word.  We (and his original readers) are guessing.  They, at least,had a contemporary context -- and maybe Paul had used this very word andexplained it in great detail to them in person.  But we have no trace ofevidence of that, and to *suppose* it is mere fantasy.So -- we are *desperately* in need of external evidence about this word.And it seems to be exceptionally meagre.  That is precisely the problem.I can think of several more or less equally plausible hypotheses aboutthe word:a)  it was a standard gutter term of abuse for (some or all, maybe    very specific, maybe very general) homosexual male activitiesb)  it was a term of abuse used by Jews about the awful homosexual    Greeks (which may or may not be consciously associated on their    part with the Leviticus passage)c)  Paul invented the term -- and again there may or may not be an    association with Leviticus in his doing so.  He may or may not    intend the word to have an explicit and universal application    with absolute and clear boundaries.  [Since none of his OTHER    words in that list have such character, this last seems to me    about the *least* plausible of the hypotheses I'm advancing.]Of these, I'd say off the top of my head that a) is most plausible -- butI still have reservations about that, too.If the word NEVER appears before Paul, and in later uses has some evidenceof depending on Paul, then one can opt for Paul's coining it.  If it doesappear before him, he might *still* have coined it being unaware of prioruse (in which case, his coinage is inherently confusing!) but one shouldnormally demote c) on the basis of any earlier uses (especially if theycan be shown to have been at all common in the places Paul traveled.)  Ineither of the a) or b) cases, one has to take into account Paul's relationto the community of usage he picked the word up from -- and whether it befrom the Greek or Jewish communities, Paul's relations are hardly straight-forward!There is, so far as I have yet seen, little or no external evidence to aidus in selecting one of these (or some other) hypothesis.  Your guess is asgood as mine (or maybe worse or maybe better, depending on a lot of things).But it remains -- so far -- guesswork.  And I don't know about you, but Ifor one WILL NOT equate human guesswork with the will of God.  By all meansbe convinced in your own conscience about what Paul is getting at -- as hesays elsewhere on what was in HIS day a major controversy of somewhat thissame character (Romans 14:22-23)"Hold on to your own belief, as between yourself and God -- andconsider the man fortunate who can make his decision without goingagainst his conscience.  But anybody who eats in a state of doubtis condemned, because he is not in good faith, and every act donein bad faith is a sin."For my part, I cannot see any way to resolve Paul's meaning in the use of_arsenokoitai_ without directly applicable external evidence -- and bythe nature of such external evidence, it will never reach to certaintyof constraining Paul's own intent.  Paul, like Humpty Dumpty (and me, andall the rest of us) *will* use words in ways that are personal choices --and sometimes leave his readers puzzled.  If that puzzlement leads youto God, it may be blessed -- if it should lead away (as some of Paul'swords HAVE led some people), then Paul's intense communicative effort tocontrive his meaning in our souls may have some regretable consequences.I have always found Paul to be a fantastically reliable guide -- if Iread him "in the large", if I can see him lay out his position in detailand hammer it home time and time again.  I am much less certain about hismeaning in his many brief and cryptic passages (such as this one.)In my usual discursive way, I have gone on at great length about the firstof my intended meta-exegetical points -- what would be needed to confirmthat Paul a) coined or b) in any case meant the word to mean the same asthe Leviticus prohibition.  My second point is to *stipulate* this hypo-thesis, and follow up what it implies for both his initial readers andfor later Christians.

In a previous article, Eugene.Bigelow@ebay.sun.com (Geno) says:>>If I don't think my belief is right and everyone else's belief is wrong,>>then I don't have a belief. This is simply what belief means.>>Unfortunatly, this seems to be how Christians are taught to think when>it comes to their religion. This is how everyone in the western intellectual tradition is, or was,taught to think. It is the fundamental premis "A is not not-A". If a thingis true then its converse is necessarilly false. Without this basic asumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible. Weshould distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word "believe",however. The weak sense means I am not sure. "I believe Tom went to the library." (but he could have gone to the track). The strong sensemeans I am so certain that I use it as a basis of thought. "I believe that nature operates according to certain fundamental laws." (despite the fact that nature *appears* capricious and unpredictable). Christianbelief is of the strong kind. (Though Christians may well hold beliefsof the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological topics.) >Some take it to the extreme and say that>their religion is the ONLY one and if you don't accept their teachings>then you won't be "saved". Note that these are two separate ideas. Most hold the first view, but the majority do not hold the second. Is is again a matter of pure logic thatif Christanity is true, then Hinduism (for example) must necessarilly befalse, insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with, Christaianity. (And, as a matter of *logic*, vice versa.) >It takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim>to know what God thinks/wants. It is arrogant to claim to know what *anyone* thinks or wants, unless they have told you. Christians believe God has told us what he thinksand wants.>Especially when it's based upon your>interpretation of a book. Most Christians do not base their belief on the Bible, but on the livingtradition of the Church established by Christ and guided constantlyby the Holy Spirit. The Bible is simply the written core of that tradition.>The logic in the above statement is faulty>in that it assumes two people with differing beliefs can't both be>correct. If depends what you mean by differing. If I believe Tom is six feettall and you believe he weighs 200 pounds, our beliefs differ, but we may both be right. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you beleivethat he is four foot nine, one of us, at least, must be wrong. >It's all about perception. No two people are exactly alike.>No two people perceive everything in the same way. I believe that>there is one truth. Call it God's truth, a universal truth, or call it>what you will. I don't believe God presents this truth. I think it is>just there and it's up to you to look for and see it, through prayer,>meditation, inspir- ation, dreams or whatever. Just because people may>perceive this truth differently, it doesn't mean one is wrong and the>other is right. Thus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being can find it. You assert that anyone who believe that we can find absolute truth is mistaken. In short, you believe that anyone whodoes not share your belief on this point is wrong. QED.>As an example, take the question, "Is the glass half>empty or half full"? You can have two different answers which are>contradictory and yet both are correct. So, for your belief to be>true, does not require everyone else's belief to be wrong.Here I begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with theknowability of truth, but simply with language. Saying that the glass is half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is halffull: it is the same fact expressed in different words. (The wholepoint of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimistand the optimist express the *same* fact.) It is, of course, quite true that different people may express the same belief in different words. It is also true that they may failto understand each other's words as expressions of the same beliefand may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart. Greatscisms have occurred in just this way, and much ecumenical work hasbeen done simply in resolving differences in language which concealagreement in belief. This does not mean, in any sense, that all beliefsare equally valid. Since some of the beliefs people hold contradictsome other beliefs that other people hold, after all obfuscationsof language and culture in the expression of those beliefs havebeen stripped away, some of the beliefs that some people hold must,**necessarilly** be false, and it is neither arrogant nor illogicalto say so. If I believe X and you believe Y we may both be correct, but if Y is equivalent to not-X then one of us is wrong and as longas we hold our respective beliefs, we must each regard the other as in error.-- ==============================================================================Mark Baker                  | "The task ... is not to cut down jungles, but aa888@Freenet.carleton.ca   | to irrigate deserts." -- C.

They are far more likely to think thatthey are just the result of the fevered imaginations of a religious nutter.That is one reason why I am always deep;y suspicious of bald judgementprophesies without any explanation of the reasons for the judgement. Thisdoesn't have to be long winded. To see a relatively modern example lookat Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural speech. The relevant section isbelow. It is this type of spiritual insight which was missing in bothprophesies posted here.--- Excerpt from Abraham Lincoln's 2nd Inaugural speech----Both read the same Bible, and pray to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces; but let us judge notthat we be not judged. The prayers of both could not he answered that of neitherhas been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. ''Woe unto theworld because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe tothat man by whom the offence cometh" If we shall suppose that American Slavery is one of those offences which, in the provdence of God, must needs comebut which, having  continued through  His appointed time, He now wills to removeand that He gives to both North and South, this terrible war, as the woe due tothose by whom the offence came, shall we discern therein an departure fromthose divine attribute which the believers in a Living God always  ascribe to Him ? Fondly do we hope - fervently do we pray - that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the bond-man's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited  toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn  with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand  years ago, so still it must be said "the judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous altogether"  With malice toward none; with charity for all;  with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan - to do all which may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.--                                                                     ___Bill Rea                                                            (o o)-------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---| Bill Rea, Computer Services Centre, | E-Mail   b.rea@csc.canterbury.ac.nz || University of Canterbury,           | or     cctr114@csc.canterbury.ac.nz || Christchurch, New Zealand           | Phone (03)-642-331 Fax (03)-642-999 |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a good point.  Christ was hardly the only person who claimed to bethe Messiah--in fact, a number of "Messiahs" were active in the area from thetime of the Roman conquest to after the fall of Masada.  Many of the statements made by the apostles--especially their repeatedattempts to give Jesus a sword (give him military power) point to the fact thatthey didn't realize the true nature of his reign until after the fact.  Many ofthe statements in the Bible can be seen as being oriented toward explaining this new definition of "Messiah" to the Jews who were being preached to.Alan Terlep    "...and the scorpion says, 'it's Oakland University, Rochester, MIin my nature.'"atterlep@vela.acs.oakland.edu

This morning about 6:00,the feds punched holes in the compound walls by using a tank.  They then started using non-lethal tear gas.  Shortly after noon, 2 cultmembers were seen setting fire to the compound.  So far, about 20-30people have been seen outside the compound.  The fate of the other 60 or70 people is unknown, neither is the fate of the 17 children that wereinside.  The compound did burn to the ground.Koresh, who at times has claimed to be the Messiah, but then backed offand only claimed to be a prophet, had promised several times to comeout peacefully if his demands were met.  First, he demanded that hismessage be broadcast on the radio, which it was, but he didn't come out.He claimed to be waiting for a message from God.  Finally, he said thatGod told him that he needed to decipher the mystery of the 7 seals inRevelation, and when he was finished, he'd come out.  He finished thefirst one, but didn't do any more work that anyone knows of since then.The federal agents did warn him that if they didn't come out, they would be subjected to tear gas.I think it's really sad that so many people put their faith in a mereman, even if he did claim to be the son of God, and/or a prophet.  Ithink it underscores the importance of putting you faith only inthings that are eternal and knowing for yourself what the Scripturessay and what they mean, instead of relying on others to do it for you,even if those others are learned and mean well.Paul Conditt

At our parish on Holy Thursday, instead of the priests washing feet("Who wants to get around people's feet," according to one of ourpriests) the congregation was "invited" to come up and help wash oneanother's hands.   The symbolism of this action distressed me, and again I refused toparticipate.  I thought that if we were to have to come up withrubrics for this liturgical action (i.e. "Body of Christ" -- "Amen"for receiving Communion), that they could be "I am not responsible forthe blood of this man."   Also for part of the Eucharistic Prayer ("Blessed are You, God ofall creation...") was substituted some text read by a lay couple.  Thepriest certainly should not have given this part of the Mass over toothers, and I was so disturbed that I declined to receive Communionthat night (we aren't required to anyway -- I instead offered upprayers for our priests and parish).>So we've been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Mass>going down?  I don't mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday or>Friday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware >of God's presence.  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses...maybe I should >just offer it up :)  Has anyone else noticed declining congregational>participation in Catholic Masses lately?   The quality of the Mass has not changed.  Again, if it were to becelebrated according to the rubrics set down by the Church, it wouldstill be "liturgically" beautiful.  The problem comes about frompeople trying to be "creative" who are not.   I think the answer to your question on participation could be thatgiven by Father Peter Stravinskas in answer to the question posed bythe title of Thomas Day's _Why Catholics Can't Sing_.  "They don'twant to" because of all this nonsense.   By the way, for any non-Catholics reading this, the problem doesnot reflect bad liturgy by the Catholic Church, but by those who aredisobedient to the Church in changing it on their own "authority."----------Steve Creps, Indiana Universitycreps@lateran.ucs.indiana.edu

And such were some of you..."  I Cor. 6:9-11.Would someone care to comment on the fact that the above seems to sayfornicators will not inherit the kingdom of God?  How does this applyto homosexuals?  I understand "fornication" to be sex outside ofmarriage.  Is this an accurate definition?  Is there any such thing assame-sex marriage in the Bible?  My understanding has always been thatthe New Testament blesses sexual intercourse only between a husbandand his wife.  I am, however, willing to listen to Scriptural evidenceto the contrary."You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is anabomination.  Also you shall not have intercourse with any animal tobe defiled with it, nor shall any woman stand before an animal to matewith it; it is a perversion."  Lev. 18:22-23.I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows theverse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.  I knowof no New Testament passages that clearly condemn, or even mention,intercourse with animals.  Do those who argue for the legitimacy ofhomosexual intercourse believe that the Bible condemns bestiality as aperversion, and if so, why?  That is, what verses would you cite toprove that bestiality was perverted and sinful?  Could the verses youcite be refuted by interpreting them differently?  Can one be aChristian zoophile?By the way, I myself am subject to sexual desires that I did notchoose to have and that many people would regard as perverted andsinful, so please understand that I am not asking these questions outof an antipathy towards my fellow "people of alternativeorientations".  I do believe, however, that one should read the Biblewith an attitude of "what is the Bible trying to say" and not "what doI WANT the Bible to say."  I choose not to give in to my "perverted"sexual desires because I believe the Bible tries to tell me, whether Ilike it or not, that such things are sin.  It is frustrating at times,and I have had days where it really got me down, but I don't blame Godfor this, I blame the sin itself.- Mark[There's some ambiguity about the meaning of the words in the passageyou quote.  Both liberal and conservative sources seem to agree that"homosexual" is not the general term for homosexuals, but is likely tohave a meaning like homosexual prostitute.  That doesn't meant that Ithink all the Biblical evidence vanishes, but the nature of theevidence is such that you can't just quote one verse and solve things.I think your argument from fornication is circular.  Why ishomosexuality wrong?  Because it's fornication.  Why is itfornication?  Because they're not married.  Why aren't they married?Because the church refuses to do a marriage ceremony.  Why does thechurch refuse to do a marriage ceremony?  Because homosexuality iswrong.  In order to break the circle there's got to be some otherreason to think homosexuality is wrong.--clh]

God's experience of time is so completely different from our own,since He is both within and without it.  Using words like "foreknowledge"and "predestination" are semantically incorrect when it comes to describingGod's perception of our action, because, for God, the beginning, living, andending of our lives are all the same.  Sort of.  For God, there is no "before"when He did not know, so he could not have "foreknowledge" of our lives ora time when he could have "predestined" our actions.  In fact, since ourunderstanding of things is so tied to our linear experience of time, Iwould say that it is impossible for us to understand completely how ourfree will interacts with God's control of the universe.Tom Ault

This is no less logical than the assumption that if something is_not_ in the Bible, then it _must not_ be done.  But I don't reallythink that's what he's saying anyway.  See below.>If slavery is immoral (which I believe it is, can I assume that everyone>else in this group does too?), why doesn't Jesus or any of the apostles>speak out against it?

What about the letter to Philemon?  In it Paul at least hints that acertain slave be released.  Also, slavery in those times was not thesame as the type of slavery we had in the U.S.  I think a bettercomparison would be to indentured servitude.  I don't really want to getinto a discussion on slavery.  Anyway, although it does demonstrate yourpoint, I don't think it is relevent, because the original poster did notsay that absence of specific condemenation proves something is notimmoral.   Back to the original poster's assertion.  He is not in fact makingthe logical error of which you accuse him.  He stated the fact that theBible does not say that babies cannot be baptized.  Also, we know thatthe Bible says that _everyone_ must be baptized to enter Heaven._Everyone_ includes infants, unless there is other Scripture to thecontrary, i.e. an exception.  Since there is no exception listed in theBible, we must assume (to be on the safe side) that the Bible means whatit says, that _everyone_ must be baptized to enter Heaven.  And so webaptize infants.   To summarize, you accused the original poster of saying if somethingis not forbidden by the Bible, then that proves it is OK; i.e. ifsomething cannot be disproven, it is true.  He rather seemed to beasserting that since the Bible does not forbid, _you cannot prove_,using the Bible, that it is _not_ OK.  There is a difference betweenproving whether or not something can be proven or disproven (there aretheories on provability in the field of Logic, by the way) and actuallyproving or disproving it.  The other logical error we must avoid fallinginto is the converse: that if something cannot be proven, then it isfalse.  This seems to be the error of many _sola scriptura_ believers.   I think the only thing that can be proven here is that one cannot useScripture alone to prove something either way about infant Baptism,although the evidence seems to me to favor it.----------Steve Creps, Indiana Universitycreps@lateran.ucs.indiana.edu

M. Wilson   (London, 1923).2] Another work that might be useful is:   "The Acts of the Apostles, a Critical Edition with Introduction and   Notes on Selected Passages", Albert C. Clark (Oxford, 1933;   reprinted 1970).(This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that thetext in Codex Bezae is the more authentic.  I don't know if itactually contains an english translation or not.)3] Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is:   "The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in   Acts", Eldon J Epp (Cambridge, 1966).4] The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from theearly '80s.  (I can supply the reference if anyone's interested.)5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.  So ifyou're interested in examining the differences in the long recensionan excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in:   "A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT", Bruce Metzger (United Bible   Society, 1971).Metzger's book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition ofthe Greek NT.  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that wentbehind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included inthe UBS3.  Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings areincluded in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts).In particular in the introduction to the section on Acts Metzger writes:   "[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full   report (with an English translation) of the several additions and   other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ...   Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the   text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the   evidence that supports the divergent readings." (p 272).>I understand that one of the early codexes, Vaticanus and Siniaticus has>this version of Acts.  It would be interesting to know what the>differences are between the long and the short forms.6] Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have (including theones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter(or Alexandrian) version.  The longer version to which you refer isusually called the "Western" version and its main witness is the CodexBezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark's edition(mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas thetext edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelationsin the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The maindifference seems to "expansion" of detail in the Western text (or, ifyou prefer "contractions" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seemsto be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specificcases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is themore authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anythingapproaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text representspurely the "authentic" version, (ii) each variant reading has to beexamined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in theAlexandrian text is the "better" more often than not.N

However, IMO, I'ld rather give advice to your friend!I think I've been through something similar to him, and one thing I cansay is that the basic problem is that each of you are now trying tocommunicate from different worldviews.  Why he talks about those thingsis because they are now "obvious" to him.  What is "obvious" to him isnot obvious to you.  Secondly, why he may be very persuasive is becausefrom his point of view, he has been on "both sides of the fence".  ThisI mean that before he turned "fundamentalist", you two are agreeablebecause both of you see things from the same side.  If suddenly, as ifa new world of reality has suddenly opened up to him, it is like thediscovery of let's say a new continent, or a new planet.  To him, he'sgot to tell you because he has seen something much more wonderful thanwhere he was, and what he thinks is much better than where you are now.You have got to realise that from his point of view, he means well toyou, eventhough he may end up offending you.  To him, it is worth thatrisk.  Nevertheless, it is really up to him to respect where you standand listen to you as well.

How do I convince him that I am 'beyond saving' so he>won't try?  Thanks for any advice.So far, I've only been trying to explain things from his side.  However,I do understand how you feel too, because I wasn't a Christian for a goodpart of my life as well.  I was quite turned off by Christians or"fundamentalists" who were really all out and enthusiastic about theirfaith.  They really scared me, to tell you the truth.  Unfortunately,"religious belief" is a very personal thing, just as your agnosticismis also a very personal thing to you.  Since the Christian belief isinevitably at odds with anything non-Christian (religious or otherwise),it will be a touchy matter.  Like all friendships, it will take bothsides to do their part to make it work.  In this matter, maybe you cando your part by telling him nicely that you are not able to dig what he'strying to convince you about, that it's beyond you or not your concern"for now".  Don't tell him it's nonsense, because to him it is reality -and that would be a real insult.  He'll also have to be careful not toinsult where you stand too.Like I said before, I wish I could give your friend some advice too.I'll admit that I did similarly to some of my friends when I became aChristian.  In some ways, I wish I could have done things a littledifferently.  However, it was difficult then because I was so excitedand just blabbered away about what I've found!  To me, it was too goodnot to know.  To some, I was crazy, and I didn't really care most ofthe time what they thought.  You will probably think he's crazy too -but God is very real to him, as real as you are to him.  Keep that inmind.  And he thinks he can convince you because since God is so realto him, he doesn't see why God can't be real to you too.I don't know how helpful this is to you.  But all the best anyhow -this is quite a challenge for you to face.

Sure, there are some who want gloryfor themselves who speak in tounges, just as there are among thosewho do not have this gift.  There were people like this in the Corinthianchurch also.  that does not mean that there is no true gift or that allwho speak in tounges do it for their own glory in the sight of men.  I would venture to say that a large percentage of those who do speak in tounges do so more often in private prayer than in public.Link Hudson[There were apparently those in the early church who claimed thatat Pentecost the miracle was that the crowd were all given theability to understand the Apostles speaking in Greek.  --clh]

I feel this is ridiculous for two reasons: 1.  They weren't added later by the Catholic Church; they were*always* part of what was considered inspired scripture.(This has been dealt with in previous postings...no reasonto repeat the info.)2.  It is more likely than not that when St. John (or whomever) wrotethe book of Revelation WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED SCRIPTURE was** NOT ** the same thing you and I are holding in our hands!If one takes the translation of "this book" in REV 18:22 (or somewherearound there) to mean "all of scripture", then all of us are likelyholding something that is in violation of this command.It is impossible to exactly date the scriptures, even the N.T. ones(they didn't like to date their letters, I guess).  I really wish Ihad my bible with me right now to get the facts straight, but I believethat several of the N.T. letters, chief among them 2 Peter, have theirmost likely date of composition in the early second century A.D.Revelation was almost certainly written durin the reign of Domition (sp?), A.D. 80-96.  Thus it could be argues that we are allin sin if we accept 2 Peter as scripture, since it was "added" to thebook after the composition of Revelation, when we are told to add nothing more.If you want to get the exact dates, get a copy of the New AmericanBible.

The teacher of the class is what I consider to beclosed-minded and bigotted on the subject of what the definition ofChristianity is.  His definition is tied directly to that of theTrinity and the Catholic church's definition of it and belief inJesus Christ is not sufficient to call one's self a Christian.While his saying it doesn't make it so,  I nevertheless feel insulted(or am I just neurotic? :^) ). I would like to be able to respond tohim with some sense of literacy while maintaining an amiablestudent-teacher relationship.So, is there common definition of what Christianity is?  As theprevious discussion of the Trinity did not lend itself to an exchangeof flames, I am hopeful that this will also not produce majorflames.Regards,--Larry AutrySilicon Graphics, St. Louisautry@sgi.com [Often we get into discussions about who is Christian.  Unfortunatelythere are a number of possible definitions.  Starting from the broadest, commonly used definitions are:  a historical definition  people who accept Christ as Lord and savior  a broad doctrinal definition  narrow doctrinal definitions1) By a historical definition I mean the sort of definition a secularhistorian would likely use.  This would include any group thatdeveloped out of the Christian church, and continues within the samebroad culture.  E.g. some Unitarians would fail just about anydoctrinal test you could come up with.  Yet it's clear that that groupdeveloped from Christianity, and people from very differentbackgrounds (e.g. Hindus) would likely see them as part ofChristianity.  This is not a definition most Christians like, but it'srelevant in some political and ethnic contexts.2) Accepting Christ as Lord and savior is a test used by manyChristian groups for membership, e.g. the Southern Baptists andPresbyterian Church (USA).  I would qualify it by saying that whatmost people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to Christ, so thatsomeone who accepted Christ as one of many gods would not fit.  It'san attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not basedon technical doctrine.  By this definition, groups such as Arianswould be viewed as heretical Christians, but still Christians.  In themodern context this would include Mormons, JW's, and "onenessPentecostals".  They would be viewed as heretical Christians, butstill Christian.  In practice I believe just about everyone who fallsinto this category would accept the Apostle's Creed.3) The next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition,which includes all of the major strands of Christianity, but excludesgroups that are felt to be outside "historic Christianity."  This isof course a slippery enterprise, since Catholics could argue thatProtestants are outside historic Christianity, etc.  But I think themost commonly accepted definition would be based on something like theNicene Creed and the Formula of Chalcedon.  The attempt is tocharacterize doctrines that all major strands of Christianity agreeare key.  Obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement.  AMormon will regard the LDS church as a major strand, and thus will notwant to include anything that contradicts their beliefs.  But I thinkthis definition would have fairly broad acceptance.4) Finally, some people use definitions that I would say are limitedto a specific Christian tradition.  E.g. some evangelicals onlyconsider someone Christian if he has had an evangelical-styleconversion experience, and some I've even heard of groups that limitit to their specific church.I think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used.A lot is going to depend upon the purpose you're using it for.  Ifyou're using it descriptively, e.g. in history or anthropology, you'llprobably use definition 1 or 2.  If you're using it normatively, i.e.to say what you believe the Christian message is, you'll probably usea definition like 3 or even 4.--clh]

Presbyterianand Reformed seminaries probably place a lot more emphasis on the biblicallanguages than others.  (Of course, any divinity school that has a doctoralprogram in biblical studies is going to have extensive language resources!  Butthere are quite a few masters-degree-granting seminaries here at which theattitude seems to be more, "Well, if you're *really* interested we'll give youa semester-long course, but we don't understand why . . .")The pattern here at the Louisville Presbyterian Seminary is for first-yearstudents to take intensive five-week introductory language courses in eachlanguage, followed by semester-long exegesis courses.  (That is: Hebrew inAugust, OT exegesis in the fall; Greek in January, NT exegesis in the spring.) These courses are required for graduation, a third or a half of the students,I'd say, take advanced biblical work that requires language work.

I see three possibilities:     1) The Church has received a Public Revelation since the deathof (for example) Joan of Arc.     2) The Church was given a list before the death of St Johnwhich had Joan's name on it.     3) There is no public revelation about Joan, and RomanCatholics are free to doubt that she died in a state of grace, oreven that she is a historical character.

While reason is a gift from God, it is also infected by sin.Yet we do not reject reason entirely--and neither, I think, does Darren.  We need reason, as Darren himself has pointedout, to comprehend God's revelation of himself in the Bible.But reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believethe Word.  We need, first and foremost, faith.  For "the sinfulmind is hostile to God.  It does not submit to God's law,*nor can it do so*"  (Romans 8:7).Luther accepted Scripture as the sole means of revelation("Sola Scriptura"), but accepted the necessity of the useof reason (with faith) in comprehending that revelation.Yet Luther also said, regarding baptism, "But mad reasonrushes forth, and, because Baptism is not dazzling likethe works which we do, regards it as worthless." (LargeCatechism, Fourth part, Baptism).  To make matters morecomplicated, Luther was the sort of theologian that many people would describe as an `absolutist'.  I've seen him described as a `take no prisoners' theologian.We might conclude, given these observations, that Lutherwas inconsistent or mad.  And surely at least some havecome to that conclusion.  But it might be useful torecall that Jesus was also called mad.  And Peter feltcompelled to defend himself and the apostles againsta charge of drunkenness on Pentecost.  So we as Christiansought to be careful about rejecting Luther (or others) as mad.  Rather, we should imitate the Bereans, whoexamined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paulsaid was true (Acts 17:11).The basis for the confidence with which Luther, Peter, Paul, and manyothers preached the gospel was not just reason, but faith and the HolySpirit.  This is not faith divorced from reason, but a faith thatguides, informs, and uses reason.  The Spirit enables us to know thetruth and to proclaim it boldly.  God does not want us to preach themessage that "I think that Jesus might have risen from the dead" butrather "I know that my redeemer lives!"  (Job 19:25).  The Christiandoes not side with Pilate in saying "What is truth?" but ratherfollows Christ, who said, "In fact, for this reason I was born, andfor this I came into the world, to testify to the truth.  Everyone onthe side of truth listens to me" (John 18:37).We can know the truth because God has promised us that we canknow the truth.  Jesus said, "If you hold to my teachings,you are really my disciples.  Then you will know the truth,and the truth will set you free" (John 8:31,32).  The Proverbsurge us "Buy the truth, and do not sell it." (Pr 23:23).The Psalmist prayed "Do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth"(Ps 119:43).  Evidently he believed that the word of truthwas in fact `in his mouth'.  Yet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truthis motivated by self-glorification.  But if we present thetruth as the teachings of Scripture, revealed by the Spirit, and not our own invention, and if we stand readyto be proved wrong on the basis of Scripture, as Lutherdid, then we are not arrogant, but humble.  We should humblytrust in God's promise of truth, just as we trust in hispromise of forgiveness.REXLEX> It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be REXLEX> absolute about a thing.Darren> But how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops,Darren> and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears.I agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachingsof Scripture, and the products of our own reason--even when suchreasoning is based on Scripture.  However I think I would drawthe line of distinction more `reasonably'  :-)  and less `academically'than you would.Darren> For example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translationsDarren> include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper,Darren> and that Jesus said, exactly, "This is my body."Darren> We'll presume that what he said was totally without error andDarren> absolutely true.

We do not have any record that heDarren> elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of Tran- or Con-Darren> substantiation?  He didn't say. Darren is almost at the point of making a very Lutheran statementabout the Lord's supper.  The Lutheran approach is to saythat if Jesus said, "This is my body," then that is what weshould believe.  Other interpretations are rejected simply becausethey are not taught in Scripture.Recall that Jesus' words do not stand alone on this subject.  We alsohave Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 11:17-34,--in which he passed on tous, what he received from the Lord.  In particular he said, "Forwhenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim theLord's death until he comes."  By these words we should believe thatthe bread that we eat in the Lord's Supper really is bread (as well asthe Lord's body)--as our senses in fact tell us.  Does this *prove*that tran-substantiation is false?  I suppose someone could say thatPaul spoke metaphorically of the Lord's body as bread, simply becausethat is the way the body appears when we eat it.  But this thought isfound nowhere in Scripture.  So we reject it.  Thus the primaryreason for rejecting tran-substantiation is not that we canprove it false, but that it is simply not found in Scripture.[side remark]I've been told that the Lutheran doctrine on real presence iscon-substantiation.  But it has been non-Lutherans who have toldme this.  We tend not to use the word.  I almost think that thisis used more by professors of comparative religion, who need labelsto compare Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed teachings on the Lord'sSupper.  But almost every church wants to call their own teaching"real presence" because that was the traditional teaching of the church.[end side remark]Darren> When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoningDarren> can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that weDarren> are infallible -- the non- Christians around us rarely believeDarren> that implicit claim.

"Khons, the son of the great goddess-mother, seems to have been gernaerallyrepresented as a full-grown god. The Babylonian divinity was also representedvery frequently in Egupt in the very same wayas in the land of his nativity-i.e. as a child in his mother's arems.  THis was the way in which Osiris, 'theson, the husband of his mother,' was often exhibited, and what we learn of thisgod, equally as in the case of Khonso, shows that in his original he was noneother than Nimrod.  It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry wasoriginally founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis, the goddess-mother,or wife of Osiris.  But what could have led to the union of a Masonic body withthese Mysteries, had they not had particular reference to architecture, and hadthe god who was worshipped in them not been celebrated for his success inperfecting the arts of fortification and building?  Now, if such were the case,considering the relation in which, as we have already seen, Egypt stood toBabylon, who would naturally be liiked up to there as the great patron of theMasonic art?  The strong presumption is, that Nimrod must have been the man. He was the first that gained faim in this way.  As the child of the Babyloniangoddess-mother, he was worshipped in the character of Ala mahozim, 'The God ofFortification.'  Osiris, the child of the Egyptian Modonna, was equallycelebrated as 'the strong chief of the buildings.'  THis strong chief of thebuildings was origninally worshipped in Egypt with every physicallcharacteristic of Nimrod.  I have already noticed the fact that Nimrod, as theson of Cush, was a negro.  Now, there was a tradition in Egypt, recorded byPlutarch, that 'Osiris was black'......."  HislopIt was like a cold slap to my face, when my wifes uncle brought out hiscerimonial dress and it was leopard skin.  I mean real leopard skin.   He toldme that only the highest of degrees wore the leopard skin.  (The reason that hestarted telling me all this was that he had just been given a couple of monthsto live and my wife had led him to a saving faith in Christ and he immediatelyrepented from 'mysteries' of the lodge!)Nimr-rod from Nimr, a "leopard," and rada or rad "To subdue."  It is auniversal principle in all idolatries, that the high priest wears the insigniaof the god he serves.  Any representation of Osiris usually show the wearing ofsome leopard.  It is interesting that the Druids of Britian also show, orshould I say hide, this representation.  They, however, worshipped the "spottedcow".I'll stand by my statements.  Masonry is of the "mystery" religions that allfind their source in Babylon, the great harlot. Sorry Peter,  I do not mean tobe a "cold slap to the face" but there is to much evidence to the contrary thatMasonry doesn't find its origins in Egypt.  Of the Masons I have personallytalked to, all refered to Egypt as their origin.  Why are you now separatingyourself from this which not many years ago, was freely admitted?-Rex

The reason Idropped philosphy as my major was because I ran into too many pharisaicalSimon's.  I don't know how many walking encyclopedia's I ran across inphilosphy classes.  The problem isn't in knowing sooooo much more than youraverage lay person, the problem comes when you become puffed up about it. Schaeffer is just fine for the average lay person.  That was who he waswritting to.  I suppose that you would have criticised John that his gospel wasto simple.  I've talked with Schaeffer one on one.  I've been in lectures withthe man when he was being drilled by philosphy students and prof's from secularas well as Christian universities. (ND alone would fill both those catagories) His answers were enough that the prof's themselves often were taken back andcaused to re-think what their question was.  I saw this time and time again atdifferent open forums.  So yes, Schaeffers books are by in large, well,simplistic.  It certainly isn't grad level reading.  But we must get off ourhigh horses when it comes to recommended reading.  Do you seriously think mostpeople would get through the first chapter of Wittgenstein?  I may have more tosay about this secular scientist at another time.Also, one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by *insistent*inquisitiveness.  One cannot live his life constantly from a cartisian doubtbase.  Look, the Christian wholeheartedly supports genuine rationality.  But we mustadd a qualification to give this balance.  Christianity is second to none inkeeping reason in its place.  We never know the value of a thing until we knowits limits.  Put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaustit of all value!THis is why Xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic. It also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism, and not Christianfaith, which leads to irrationality.  If we forget the limits of a thing, wefly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironiclesson of life: "More without limits is less;  less with limits is more."  Or as I have so often stated it, freedom without form soon becomes form w/ofreedom.Let's put it another way.  The rationality of faith is implacably opposed toabsurdity but has no quarrel with mystery. Think about that.  It can tell thedifference between the two if you will let it.  Christianity's contention withrationalism is not that it has too much reason in it, but that it has verylittle else.  When a Christian comes to faith his understanding and his trustgo hand in hand, but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be calledto go on by itself without his understanding.This is where the principle of suspended judgment applies.  At such time if theChristian faith is to be itself and let God be God, it must suspend judgmentand say, "Father I do not understand you but I trust you."  Now don't read allyour objections of me into that statement.  I wasn't saying I do not understandyou at all, but I trust you anyway." It means that "I do not understand You *inthis situation* but I do understand *why I trust You* anyway"  Therefore I cantrust that you understand even though I do not. The former is a mysteryunrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity.  The latter isa statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery ofFaith.  So.... the principle of suspended judgment is not irrational.  It isnot a leap of faith but a walk of faith.  As believers we cannot always knowwhy, but we canalways know why we trust God who knows why and this makes allthe difference.Now, there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where I have partedcompany with philosophy- what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bitmore difficult in practice.  In practice the pressure of mystery acts on faithlike the insistent "whying" of a 3 year old.  It isn't just that we would liketo know what we do not know but that we feel we *must* know what we cannotknow.  The one produces frustration because curiosity is denied; the otherleads to genuine anguish.  More specifically the poorer our understanding is incoming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything aftercoming to faith.  If we do not know why we trust God, then we will always needto know exactly what God is doing in order to trust him.  Failing to graspthat, we may not be able to trust him, for anything we do not understand maycount decisevely against what we are able to trust.  If, on the other hand, we do know why we trust God, we will be able to trusthim in situations where we do not understand what He is doing. (Too many Xianleaders teach as if the Christian had a window in the back of his head whichallows for understanding at every foot fall)  For what God is doing may beambiguous, but it will not be inherently contradictory!  It may be mystery tous, but mystery is only inscrutable; what would be insufferable is absurdity.And that my friend, was the conclusion of Nietzche both in theory and inpractice.   --Rex

This is simply what belief means.Unfortunatly, this seems to be how Christians are taught to think whenit comes to their religion. Some take it to the extreme and say thattheir religion is the ONLY one and if you don't accept their teachingsthen you won't be "saved". It takes quite a bit of arrogance to claimto know what God thinks/wants. Especially when it's based upon yourinterpretation of a book. The logic in the above statement is faultyin that it assumes two people with differing beliefs can't both becorrect. It's all about perception. No two people are exactly alike.No two people perceive everything in the same way. I believe thatthere is one truth. Call it God's truth, a universal truth, or call itwhat you will. I don't believe God presents this truth. I think it isjust there and it's up to you to look for and see it, through prayer,meditation, inspir- ation, dreams or whatever. Just because people mayperceive this truth differently, it doesn't mean one is wrong and theother is right. As an example, take the question, "Is the glass halfempty or half full"? You can have two different answers which arecontradictory and yet both are correct. So, for your belief to betrue, does not require everyone else's belief to be wrong.[If a person has what they believe is convincing evidence that Godwill save only Christians, it's hard to see how you can criticize themfor arrogance for saying so.  It could be that they're wrong.  But Ihardly see that it's arrogance.  Let's look at this a bit closer.Suppose we had some combination of prophets and messiahs that taughtus things, but didn't say anything about exclusivity.  If we believethem, and then add "and anybody who believes anything else is damned",then you could well criticize us for arrogance.  But in this case theexclusivity is in the message as it comes from the prophets, etc.  Sowe could be wrong in believing it, but I don't see how we can becalled arrogant.  Maybe the world isn't a soft place.  Maybe certainchoices actually do have eternal consequences.  I can see calling theChristian message arrogant, in a certain sense (though only in thesame sense as calling the law of gravitation arrogant because itdoesn't give us any option over whether we fall if we jump off abuilding).  But not Christians for passing it on, given that theybelieve it.  The complaints I can see making are (1) that Christiansare wrong, or (2) that God is arrogant.  --clh]

As all infants are in sin from the time of conception (cfRomans 5.12, Psalm 1.7), they cannot possibly merit heaven, and aspurgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins, itis impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven.  Hence, the unbaptizedinfants are cut off from the God against whom they, with the whole ofthe human race except Mary, have sinned.  Which is why Jesus said,"Truly, truly I say to you, no one can enter the Kingdom of God unlesshe is born of water and Spirit" which is the true meaning of born again(John 3.5).  Thus, as infants are in sin, it is very fair for them to becut off from God and exlcuded from heaven.As St. Augustine said, "I did not invent original sin, which theCatholic faith holds from ancient time; but you, who deny it, without adoubt are a follower of a new heresy."

I don't have a concordance here but I have>some dim memory that this appears *somewhere* in the Bible.>Given a fairly specific context for what judgement is, I'd say>that more or less decides the issue.>>[Heb 9:27 --clh]Indeed, the immediate context [NASB] is:  26 Otherwise, He would have needed to suffer often  since the foundation of the world; but now once at  the consummation He has been manifested to put away   sin by the sacrifice of Himself.  27 And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die  once, and after this comes judgement;  28 so Christ also, having been offered once to bear  the sins of many, shall appear a second time, not to  bear sin, tro those who eagerly await him.The first point is that this verse is part of an even largercontext, the subject of which is not the destiny of theindividual human soul but rather the singular nature of Christ'ssacrifice, "once", and the fulfillment of the law for all of fallen mankind.  Rudolf Frieling elaborates this in detail in his "Christianity and Reincarnation".  The thrust of the passagein its context is to liken the one time incarnation and sacrifice of Christ for all mankind to the individual experience of the human being after death.  The "once" is repeated and emphasized, and it highlights the singularity of Christ's deed.  One thing for certain it does is to refute the claims of some that Christ incarnates more than once.  But the comparison to the human experience - die once, then judgement (note: not "the judgement", but just "judgement".  The word for judgement is "krisis".Hebrews 9:27 is the one passage most often quoted in defenseof the doctrine that the Bible denies reincarnation.  At thispoint, I would just emphasize again that the  passages that (arguably) speak against it are few, and that invariablythey are talking about something eles, and the apparent denialof reincarnation is either inferred, or, as in the case ofHebrews, taken literally and deposited into an implied context,namely a doctrine of the destiny of the human being afterdeath.What should be considered seriously is that the Bible is essentiallysilent about the fate of the individual human being between deathand the Last Day.  If you take the few passages that could possiblybe interpreted to mean a single earth life, they are arguable.  Andthere are other passages that point, arguably, in the other direc-tion. such as Matthew 11:14 and John 9:2.We can continue to debate the individual scraps of scripture thatmight have a bearinig on this, and indeed we should discuss them.But what I wanted to introduce into the discussion was an approachto the idea of repeated earth lives that, unlike Hindu, Buddhistand "new age" teachings, takes full cognizance of the divinity, singularincarnation, death, burial, resurrection, and second coming of Christas the savior of mankind; the accountability of each individual forhis deeds and the reality of the Fall and of sin and its consequences;the redemption of man from sin through Christ; the resurrection ofthe body, and the Last Judgement.Taken in this larger sense, many serious questions take on an entirelydifferent perspective.  E.g. the destiny of those who died in theirsins before Christ came. the relationship of faith and grace to works, the meaning of "deathbed conversion", the meaning of thesacraments, and many other things.  Not that I propose to answer allthose questions by a simple doctrine of convenience, but only thatthe discussion takes on a different dimension, and in my opinionone that is truly worthy of both man, the earth, and their Creator and Redeemer. There are many deep questions that continue to be deep, such as the meaning of the second death, and how the whole of Christiandoctrine would apply to this larger perspective of human existence.There are those who deeply believe that the things of which the Bible does not speak are not things we should be concerned with.  But Christalso indicated that there were other things that we would come to knowin the future, including things that his disciples (and therefore others) could not bear yet.  This idea that the human capacity for growth inknowledge, not only of the individual in one lifetime, but of the wholeof humanity, also takes on great meaning when we realize that our growthin the spirit is a long term process.  The Bible was not meant to codifyall spiritual knowledge in one place forever, but to proclaim the gospelof the incarnation and redeeming deed of Christ - taking the gospel in thegreater context, from Genesis to Revelation.  Now, salvation (healing) becomes, not the end of man's sojourn but its beginning.  And the Last Judgement andthe New Heaven and Earth that follow it become its fulfullment.Gerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)

Try: "And if anyone causes one of these little ones *who believes in me*to sin, it would be better for him to be thrown into the seawith a large millstone tied around his neck."  Mark 9:42"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them,for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.  I tell youthe truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of Godlike a little child will never enter it."The Colossians passage does not make faith a requirementfor baptism.  It merely says that in baptism we are born again,regenerated, and resurrected through faith.  In the caseof an infant I would say that baptism works faith in theheart of the infant--through the power of the word.The Colossians passage does make baptism a spiritual circumcision.Circumcision was the means by which a male infant was madea part of God's covenant with Israel.  It was commanded to beperformed on the eighth day.  The early church understood this,and even debated whether baptism had to be performed on theeighth day, or if it could in fact be done earlier.Aaron> Romans 10:16-17 "But not all the Israelites accepted the goodAaron> news.

How do you know they are not yet mature enough to have faith?Do you know this on the basis of God's Word, or from your ownreason?Faith is also described as a gift from God, Ephesians 2:8,9.

I don'tknow.  But original sin does not consist of God's imputationof Adam's guilt to us.  It consists of our inheritance ofAdam's sinful nature.  It is actual sin.  See for example,the Augsburg Confession, Article II, and the Apology of theAugsburg Confession, Article II, and, for extra credit,John Knox's `The Scots confession', Article III.Aaron> Now then that we have a little more background as to whyAaron> original sin is not Biblical, let's look at some of theAaron> scriptures used to support it.Aaron> Romans 5:12 "Therefore, just as sin entered the world throughAaron> one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came toAaron> all men, because all sinned--"Ask yourself this question.

Sex, or Christianity?I'm afraid I see that question as very tendentious.  Try rephrasing it:What's more important to Christians?  Love of God or loveof other human beings?to which of course the only conceivable answer is that the one is likethe other.  I am *deeply* suspicious of any "flavor" of Christianitywhich would elevate one clause of the Great Commandment to a "priority"over the other such as to claim a conflict.  True, we are told to letthe dead bury the dead, to "hate" family rather than let it keep us fromfollowing Christ.  But the dichotomy here is not one between love of ourfellows and love of God, but of allowing *social* constructs to blind usto the presense of God.  It is particularly satanic to twist love of Godin such a manner as to become an excuse to treat others as on a differentlevel than the one who is so caught up in "love" of God.The trouble comes in the relation of human love and human sex.  Yes, ithas sometimes been the case that the Church has "taught" that all sexwas nasty, evil, sinful stuff.  But when man and wife leave their parentalhomes to become helpmates, living in one flesh, it is the sex that is thevehicle of becoming "one flesh" (if you doubt me, read St. Paul on whatis wrong with frequenting prostitutes :-)).  Less provocatively, what Imean is just this: sexual bonding is a deeply founded aspect of our socialinteraction, and in particular is the foundation of the institution ofmarriage, so that unlike with many mammals, human males remain with andfoster the children they beget and support their children's mothers.This is the schema behind Genesis 2:18-24 (and behind Jesus' citation ofthat passage.)[ I observe, by the way, that not all human males in fact do as  I have just described; but another thing that characterizes  human societies is our raising of *non*begotten children, not  only orphans and adoptees and the like, but products of the  quite common infidelities of humans to their spouses. We are  in this not unique in the animal world, but the full extent of  social consequences and implications is most intricate for us. ]Yes, of course it sometimes goes "wrong" -- like all else we do, it isinfected with sin, and you find married "couples" where there is no bond,and people so deliriously addicted to the initial stages of sexual bondformation (the "infatuation", "falling in love" phase) that they breakany forming bond in order to keep stepping over the threshold of the deepunity God has prepared for us, and stepping back out again right away.Satan may indeed *use* sex as a very handy tool to corrupt human love --but in the Edenic creation, that is not its nature, and with God's graceunder the power of Christ to make all things new it need not be a problemfor Christians (though we must be vigilant, even in Christ, as the devilis watchful, prowling around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.)So, returning to the original question, what is more important to STRAIGHTChristians?  Sex, or Christianity?  Paul, clearly, tended to think thatsex was at best a distraction from Christianity (though to be charitableto him, his context was in expectation of immediate parousia, so that thehard TASKS of a married union -- the lifelong building and adaptation toeach other -- seemed somehow to undercut the "proper" preparation for animmediate eschaton.  Since we *do not* know the hour of return, we shouldact *both* with instant readiness for that *and* with a commitiment to ourmates that proposes a long lifetime together.  And telling people *not* tobond in such a perspective strikes me as crippling us in the second clauseof the the commandment to love.  I would claim that only a very few saintshave the CAPACITY to deeply love (without sexual tinges or complication,mind you) their fellow human beings unless they have had a deeply spirituallife in married union growing together as one flesh -- and that means inthe type case, with a persistent and continued sexual relationship.  Weare human, and little good comes of trying to "mortify the flesh" to thepoint of pretending to be otherwise, pretending NOT to be sexual beings.>Christianity I would hope.  Would they be willing to forgo sex>completely, in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others,It depends entirely on context.  If that context is major hypocrisyon the part of those who find us "stumbling blocks" I am much less ofa mind to efface myself so that they can pontificate about MY sins.There are some people for whom a life of celibacy is a spritual gift,and maybe even a victory against a to-them troubling sexual urge thatseems to them to lead only to sin.  Nothing I say should ever be readas demeaning such a gift.  Nor the even rarer gift of love for all ourconspecifics, and indeed for all God's creation, that can develop tothe full *without* the tutoring of a spousal/helpmate marriage foundedin sex.  But there is a difference between spiritual gifts and penance;telling people that they HAVE to have a particular gift (or else? what?)is fraught with manipulation and disregard of the differences of ourspiritual endowments from God.  To one person is given the gift ofspeaking in toungues, to another intepretation of toungues; to yetanother prophecy; and to still another teaching.  The notion that some*particular* gift is required of *all* is one of the earliest heresies.-- Michael L.

Maybe he _is_ talking to me but I just don't know or understandhow to listen.Some Christians tell me that (in their opinion) the only way to find Godis to take a plunge and commit your life to him, and you will discover.This idea of diving into the totally unknown is a little bitfrightening, but I have a few questions.1) How do you actually commit yourself? If I just say, "OK God, her yougo, I'm committing my life to you", I wouldn't really feel that he'dlistened - at least, I couldn't be sure that he had. So how does one (orhow did you) commit oneself to God?2) In committing myself in this way, what do I have to forfeit of mycurrent life? What can I no longer do? I feel that I'm as 'good' as manyChristians, and I try to uphold the idea of 'loving your neighbour' - Idon't go round killing people, stealing, etc., and I try not to getjealous of other people in any way - and I would say that I keep to thestandards of treating other people as well as many Christians. So whatdo I have to give up?3) When committed, what do I have to do? What does it involve? What (ifany) burdens am I taking on?4) So then, what's the general difference before and after? I assume,that (like on your birthday you don't suddenly feel a year older) itwon't suddenly change my life the day I commit myself. So what happens?5) How can I be sure that it is the right thing to do? How can I findout what the 'it' in the last sentence actually _is_?!Thanks very much for all your help in answering these questions.

I'verefrained from posting, in hope that someone who is more familiar withthe OT than I would answer.  But at this point I feel I have to saysomething.Many things about this posting bother me.  I know of not the slightestsuggestion in the NT that Christians should use force to propagate theGospel, and the idea that we should not be concerned about the deathof Moslems violates the heart of the Gospel.  Christ died to breakdown these distinctions.  In him there is neither Jew nor Greek, thereis neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female.  IfMoslems do not know him, we may preach to them, but we don't killthem.  Furthermore, the attack is between states, not religions.There are Christians being attacked as well.  One of the towns underattack is one of the few places where Christians and Moslems areliving together peacefully.The precedents being suggested are from the OT.  There are in fact twodifferent things being alluded to.  The first is from the entry intoCanaan.  For that to be a parallel, we would need for God to havepromised this land through a prophet.  And we would need the war to bea holy war.  There were tight constraints on behavior in thoseattacks.  Any violations were likely to cause the Israelites to bedefeated.  Rape would not have been tolerated.  While the accounts inJoshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed, note that it waspossible for a town to make peace with the Israelites, and that oncethat was done -- even when deception was involved -- they wereexpected to honor it.  In contrast, there have been many violations ofagreement in this incident. I see no evidence that God has grantedBosnia to the Serbs as a promised land, and if he had, their behaviorwould have disqualified this from being a holy war.The other OT parallel is from later, when Israel was defeated byAssyria and Babylonia.  The prophets saw this as a judgement on Israelfor her sins.  Someone asks whether we shouldn't see this as ajudgement on the Bosnians for their sins.  This sounds like a replayof the old claim that we shouldn't have doctors or hospitals becauseillness is God's judgement.  Yes, even bad things may be used by Godfor good.  That includes actions of bad people.  But that doesn'tjustify them.  If you read the prophets, you find them very clear thatin attacking Israel, the Assyrians and Babylonians were acting as*unintentional* agents of God.  Their intent was to attack God'speople, and they would be judged for it.  The fact that they wereactually carrying out God's plan didn't excuse their action.Furthermore, we shouldn't conclude from this that all attacks arejudgements from God.  God explicitly interpreted that case, throughhis prophets.  As far as I know, he did not send any prophets toBosnia.  While I find it hard to see any good in the current fighting,I am sure God will eventually make good come out of bad.  But thatdoesn't justify it, and it won't save the people who are doing it fromjudgement.I am particularly concerned about the implications of this issuebecause of current tensions between the West and Moslem-orientednations.  What we do not need is for Moslems to conclude thatChristians think it's OK to kill Moslems.  The implications for themid-East, and even relations with American Moslems, could be quiteserious.

I love it,but I am not very familiar with the different denominations, ortraditions, or common beliefs of various christian groups.I have heard various people (outside this news group)describe *idols* such as power, money, material possessions etc.  These things are worshiped in some sense I suppose, but I never really gave idols much thought.  Until now...  I have been reading the postings in this news group (which I just found a few days ago), and I have a question...  First, I'mnot trying to question anyone's belief or try to push my viewson anyone else (I haven't been at this long enough to haveany views other than I cannot get to heaven by being good,I must understand that Christ bore my sins on the cross so thatI could be saved and I need to repent, i.e. realize thatevery time I sin, I might as well stick a sharp stick inChrist's side because He took the punishment for my sins,when He died on the cross).In my studies, Mary never really comes up.  I know who she is, but that's about it.  It seems to me that a statue of Mary could be considered an idol?  Do people pray to statues of Mary?It sounds like educated christians (more educated than myselfI'm sure) believe Mary was sinless?  Wow...  I hoped to spendthe summer convincing myself (one way or the other) aboutTongues (I'm reading "Charismatic Chaos").  I guess I'll studyTongues in parallel with reading this news group.  Any help you can give me will be appreciated.    -------------------------------------------[I don't think the issue is so much that people are more educated thanyou (though it may well be that they are), as that they come from adifferent tradition than yours.This is a discussion between Catholics and Protestants.  Catholicsgenerally believe that Mary was sinless.  Protestants do not.  Theissue comes down to different sources of authority.  Protestantsgenerally limit themselves to the Bible as a source of doctrine.Since this isn't in the Bible (except in passages that no one wouldunderstand in this way if they didn't already believe it), Protestantsdon't accept it.  Catholics see continuing revelation through theChurch, though they believe the results are consistent with the Bible.I interpret your posting, not as a call for yet another argument aboutwhether the Catholic Marian devotions are idolatry (an argument I amnot prepared to see newed here), but as a sign of being interested inlearning about traditions other than your own.  Catholics are ofcourse a major one, but by no means the only one.  I generallyconsider the major traditions to be Catholic, Orthodox, andvarious subsets of Protestantism.  Within Protestantism, it's a matterof how finely you want to cut things.  These days I think the majordivision is between those who accept Biblical inerrancy and thosewho don't.  There are also a number of major historical traditions,but in recent decades distinctions are tending to blur.  I'd identify the major Protestant traditions as:  Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican (they're sort of halfway between  Catholic and Protestant), Wesleyan, Baptist, Holiness, Pentecostal,  Church of ChristBut there are a number of others.  Historical distinctions tend not tobe so important among the liberal churches anymore, and I thinkcurrent trends in society and the Church are also tending to makeconservatives seen themselves as allies from a general "evangelical"perspective.  But differences among these various traditions are stillquite marked.I think the best introduction to these issues is to read a good bookon church history.  Anyone who wants to understand the church reallyneeds to understand how we got where we are now.  A church historywill normally show you where each of these traditions came from, andgive a feeling for their nature.  Unfortunately I'm away from mylibrary at the moment, so I don't have anything specific to recommend.--clh]

However, there is a tendency among Christians to say, "I have all the answers because God gave them to me."  This is simply not the case.  I believe that the Bible is inerrant.  However, our HUMAN interpretations ofthe Bible are necessarily in error, because we are human and imperfect.  Wehave to remember that we ALL make mistakes in faith, and that because we arehuman we have an imperfect understanding of the mind and will of God.  Toclaim, as so many people do, that the existence of the Bible allows us todetermine the answers to all questions is to claim that we humans can fullyunderstand God's will.  This is hubris.

It is thevalues system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior ofthese kids.Despite the better track record of abstinence-related curricula, they aresuppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to thatdesired.

Isn't itbecause we know that a class in "how to use drugs safely if you _choose_ touse drugs" would increase drug use?  Why isn't "drug abstinence education"barred from schools because it teaches "religion"?  Aren't we abandoningthose children who will use drugs anyway, and need instruction in their safeuse?-- Joe Kellettjkellett@netcom.com

Rom 1 is really about idolatry.  It refers to homosexuality>in passing.Is everything sinful specifically elaborated on in the New Testament?Scripture does not condemn being a drug dealer.  Being ruled by theSpirit rather than the letter not only frees from legalism, it alsoprotects us from sins that are against the Spirit.  The word is atwo edged sword that cuts both ways.  I think we must be careful before we totally throw out Leviticus.  If the Law is reflection of God's character and true holy nature, thenthose who say that God endorses homosexuality run into a problem.  If homosexuality were "natural" (whatever that means) wholesome, endorsed by God, and those who oppose sexual behavior are narrow-mindedbiggots, as some would have us believe, why is there a condemnation ofit in Leviticus.  This condemnation is in the midst of all the othersex sin condemnations, and there is nothing in the text to say that thislaw was limited to temple prostitution, and no good reason to believe thatthis was the case.  Furthermore, male homosexual sex was a death-penaltycrime!  Is every sin elaborated on in the New Testament?  Take a look atI Corinthians 5.  Paul said that one of the Corinthians had broken alaw not even heard of among the Gentiles, that one should have his father'swife.  There is a prohibition against having your father's wife in Leviticus.  No other new Testament verse clearly condemns it (besidesthis one.)  Notice that Paul did not say that the sin was in commitingadultery, etc.- he spoke against having one's father's wife.  Notice also that this sexual condemnation in Leviticus is not mentionedin the specific context of paganism either.  And there was no pagan coustom mentioned in I corinthians either.  As a matter of facttaking one's father's wife wasn't even done among the Gentiles.  It wasjust a plain blantant sin, whether worshipping idols was involved ornot.>One commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds>of questions we are trying to deal with.  He encountered homosexuality>only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was>wrong.  He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act>"straight" and fail, and he had never faced Christians who are trying>to define a Christian homosexuality, which fits with general Christian>ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the>relationship between God and man.  It is unfair to take Paul's>judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make>judgements on these questions.One of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argumentis because Paul probably did face this and other problems.  Sin canbe tough to over come, especially without supernatural power.  Ishomosexual sin any more difficult to overcome that heterosexual sin,like lusting after a married woman, or sleeping around with people ofthe opposite sex?  I doubt it, and even if it is, that is no excuse.God is greater than all of it. Another reason we reject it is because it ignores the supernaturalpower of God to intervene in this kind of situation.  How many people have been set free from sin by the power of God?  Sure theremay be any groups that have tried to change homosexuals and failed.That is a reflection on the people involved in the program, and notGod's willingness and ability to change a sinner.  Any program thatuses formulas may fail.  What people need is the power of God tochange them, whether they are involved in homosexual sin, or any othersin.>I claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is>not entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.  Paul's>tendency, as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating>holidays, is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues>to look very carefully at the good of the people involved, and to>avoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging.>For example, while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat>meat, he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about>which they had personal qualms. I don't see how you come to that conclusion.  Paul's dealings withpastorial issues encouraged people to give up their liberties in orderto spare others- not to allow people to continue in sin because itwas just too difficult.  Take the example of eating meat offered to idols.Paul felt that there was nothing wrong, in an abstract sense, witheating the meat.  Yet he advised believers to sacrifice their libertyto eat meat in order to spare others.  But Paul never allowed people to sin because living holy was just totough.  Paul wrote to "make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the luststhereof."  (Romans 13:14)  Then he goes in to a discourse on how weshould sacrifice our own liberty in order to spare the consciences of others.Suppose it were not a sin for people to practice homosexual acts.  Since others consider it to be a sin, then using Paul's approachon pastorial issues, those who would otherwise be homosexuals should sacrifice their liberty and be celbate or monogamously married to amember of the opposite sex.  Paul never offers a lesser sin (homosexual"marriage") to prevent people from engaging in what may be considered a more damaging sin.>For another example, Paul obviously>would have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances)>remain unmarried.

It's like saying, "How should I kill myself, with gun oraresenic?  What about the person who just is overcome with a desire tosleep with goats?  Would it be better for him to sleep with one goat,or all of them?  What about the person who wants to sleep with his aunts?Would it be better for him to sleep with one aunt or all of them?  In all these cases, the more people or animals one sleeps with, the higherthe chance that they will get a disease.  But this only deals with physical aspects of the question.  Whichever sin is commited, it all leads to spiritual death.>Cent. actions are the same.  When Christian homosexuals say that their>relationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paul>would have been familiar with, this is exactly the same kind of>argument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors.The issue that is most often addressed in Scripture seems to be theactual act.  Second, isn't it historical snobbery to say thatonly homosexuals of this century are capable of having "lovingrelationships?"  There are ancient writings glorifying homosexual "love."(btw, I am one who believes in refraining from making oathes.  Also,where do you get that tax collectors are sinners.  That's certainly notexplicit.  Jesus didn't tell Zachias to quit his job.)Link Hudson.[I'm reluctant to comment in this in detail.  Our basic concepts ofthe intention of Jesus and Paul are greatly different.  As I indicatedin the article, whatever the ambiguities of various words (and I stillthink they are significant), it does seem clear that Paul consideredthe homosexuality he saw around him wrong.  What you do with this factdepends upon your basic approach to the Bible.  I'm afraid thatcommunication between legalist and anti-legalist Christians is evenharder than between Protestants and Catholics in the 16th Cent.  Sinceyou disagree with my starting point, obviously you're going todisagree with all of the intermediate discussion and conclusions.Sometimes discussion is still useful.  I've seen some very interestingwork on Paul done by Jews.  Obviously they don't agree with him, butthey sometimes have helpful insight into what he meant.  But I don'tsee much sign for hope here.  In talk.religion.misc there's an axiomthat by the time Hitler's name is invoked, all hope for sensiblediscussion is gone.  On this subject, when sleeping with goats isinvoked, I don't think there's enough basis for understanding to beworth pursuing.  --clh]

This is not arrogance --> it is just an inescapable fact.Yes, there are these two senses of interpretation, and certainly ourdecision to accept Scripture as inspired ultimately rests on our ownprivate opinion.  However, when reading Scripture, we have to rememberthat the Scriptures were given by God for our instruction, and thatthe interpretation that matters is the one God intended.  For example,if I decide that the fact that John the Baptist is Elijah teaches thedoctrine of reincarnation, I am wrong because that is not the intendedinterpretation.  The prophets didn't make up this teaching; it camefrom God, and we must accept it as such.  This necessarily means thatour private interpretations must take a back seat to the meaning Godintended to convey.  Certainly we must rely on our best efforts todetermine what this meaning is, but this very fact should make usrecognize that our private interpretations cannot be automaticallyaccepted as the infallible interpretation of God.  We need to test thespirits to see if they are from God.  When the Holy Spirit speaks, hesays the same thing to all; he won't tell me that a passage means onething and tell you it means another.  If the two of us come toconflicting conclusions, we can't both be completely right.  We knowour interpretations are reliable only when the Church as a wholeagrees on what Scripture means.  This is how we know the doctrines ofthe Trinity, the dual nature of Christ, etc. infallibly.  Thesematters are not up for private interpretation.This is the reason Peter goes on to talk about the deceptiveness ofthe false teachers.  They preferred their own private interpretationto the God-given teaching of the apostles.  It is through such privateinterpretation that the traditions of men, so soundly denounced inScripture, are started.Tony

THE PERSONS OF THE GODHEAD     Of all of the doctrines of Scripture, this is the most     important.  The Bible is pre-eminently a revelation of God.      Therefore, our first objective in studying the Bible should     be to know God.     I believe that the Bible teaches that there are Three     Persons in the Godhead (Trinity):  God, the Father; God the     Son--the Lord Jesus Christ; and God, the Holy Spirit.  I     believe that they are individual Persons who are one in     nature, meaning that They are identical in nature, each     possessing the same divine attributes.  They are also     equally worthy of our worship, our trust, and our obedience.     Cf. Matt.28:19, 2 Cor.13:14; John 14:8,9,16,17.II.  THE ATTRIBUTES, or CHARACTERISTICS, OF THE GODHEAD.     A.  God's nature is revealed in the Name He has taken for         Himself: Jehovah.  He is the living God, eternal, and         unchanging.  He is without beginning, and without         ending.  Cf. Isa.42:8.     B.  God is a spirit.  Cf. John 4:24.     C.  God is love.  Cf. 1 John 4:8,16.         As such, He is gracious, merciful, good, faithful,         patient, and full of lovingkindness.  Cf. Psa 89:1,2;         Psa 103:8; Nahum 1:7.     D.  But God is also holy and righteous.  He is absolutely         without sin in His nature, and so is incapable of         sinning in though, word, or action.  Cf. Ex. 15:11; Isa.         6:3.     E.  God is omnipresent (everywhere present at the same time         in the completeness of His Person), omniscient (all         knowing, knowing all things--the end from the beginning,         infinitely wise), omnipotent (almighty, sovereign, with         unlimited power over all creation).         God is infinite in His presence, wisdom, and power.  It         is my conviction that the work of the Lord in our day         has become very man-centered, and that the people in our         churches know very little about God.  I believe that the         Lord's work needs to be God-centered, and that the         people of God need to understand that God is sovereign         in all things:  in the affairs of nations, in the lives         of all people, and in the carrying out of His purposes         regarding salvation.III.     THE WORKS OF THE GODHEAD.     A.  In creation          All Three Persons of the Godhead were active in          creating, and all Three are active in sustaining          creation, and in ordering the course of human affairs          (for nations as well as individual people) to the end          of time.  Cf. Gen. 1:1,2; John 1:1-3; Col. 1:16-17;          Heb. 1:3.     B.  In salvation         In order to understand salvation I believe that it is         absolutely necessary to begin with God, not with man.          All three Persons of the Godhead have been, and are,         active in salvation.         1.  God, the Father             Salvation originated with God.  The Members of the             Godhead determined in eternity past that there would             be salvation, the conditions under which people             could and would be saved, and even who would be             saved.  Election to salvation is recognized in             Scripture as the work of  God, the Father.  Cf. Eph             1:3-4; 2 Thess 2:13-14.         2.  Christ, the Son of God             The Lord Jesus Christ, through His birth by the             virgin Mary, came to the earth to accomplish two             important works:             a.   He came as the final and complete revelation of                  God, the Father.  Cf. Col 1:15; heb 1:1-3.             b.   He came to provide salvation for all whom the                  Father had chosen.  He did this by His death on                  the Cross, by His bodily resurrection, and by                  His present intercessory work in heaven.  The                  work of salvation will be completed for us when                  the Lord returns.  Cf. Rom 5:8-10; 1 Cor 15:3-                  4; Heb 7:25, 1 John 3:2.         3.  The Holy Spirit             As the Author of Scripture, the theme of which is             Christ and His redemptive work, the Holy Spirit is             carrying out the redemptive plan of God in the             following ways:             a.   He convicts of sin. Cf. John 16:7-11             b.   He regenerates (known in the Bible as the new                  birth).  Cf. John 3:5-8.             c.   He indwells each believer to fulfill the work                  of sanctification.  Cf. John 14-16-17.             d.

Some say that if the two have: publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and: are unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective: qualifier) they are married/joined in God's sight.The way I read Scripture, a couple becomes married when they are *physically*married, i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse.e.g. the end of Genesis 2 (quoted from memory) ``for this reason, a man shallleave his parents and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh''(Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage).If you read through Genesis in particular, you will often come across thephraseology: ``[man] lay with [woman], and she became his wife''. Thisimplies that she became his wife when they lay together, i.e. at thepoint of intercourse.Compare this with Jewish tradition: Joseph, when he heard that Marywas pregnant, had it in mind to divorce her quietly -- but Mary and Joseph were*betrothed*, not married. i.e., they were in a binding relationship (whichrequired a divorce to get out of), but *marriage* would not occur until Maryand Joseph went to bed together.Compare with Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5, Revelation 19): the church isdescribed as the ``bride'' of Christ, but the *marriage* of the Lamb takes place when Jesus returns. i.e., we are in a binding love-relationship withJesus, but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage willtake place. I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse,because it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God.In summary, engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship, but it isnot marriage. A civil ceremony is not marriage either. Marriage occurs at thepoint when the betrothed couple go to bed together. (I don't mean to demean thecivil or church ceremony -- ours was great! I don't mean to be too pedantic.)Historically, I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony (i.e. amarriage recognised by the state), has only been around in the West sinceNapoleon, who introduced it to keep tabs on the people (although I'm ready to becorrected on that point!)This view obviously raises some questions:What about those who have had sex with one or more partners, without consideringmarriage. Are those people also ``married''?If it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse, is it necessaryto be married in the eyes of the state? (I would say Yes, because this honoursthe laws of our nations in the West. Although it is not illegal to sleeptogether though unmarried in most Western countries, I believe that it is God-honouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends beforeactually consummating our marriage. Its to do with our being salt and light, andalso to do with how people will perceive us; i.e. it is culturally insensitiveto declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony.)-- -----Michael Davis (cs89mcd@brunel.ac.uk)And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?Come to my arms, my beamish boy!

Overacker writes, responding to Simon:   I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the   net.  My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in   schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that's really beside   the point.  What does the Roman Catholic church say?   Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as   provided for in canon law.Here's some of the theology involved for the interested.There is confusion over this issue of the SSPX's "schism"; often thebasic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between:- true obedience- false obedience- disobedience- schismTake the various classifications of obedience first.  There are 2important elements involved here for my purposes:1) a command2) the response made to the commandAs far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as thePope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.  Or they can beILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the godDagon when every other full moon comes around.As far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to dowhat is commanded, or to COMPLY.Making a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:command         response            name-----------------------------------------------------LEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedienceILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedienceLEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedienceILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedienceSo now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.Obedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal.  The nature ofthe commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough toconsider someone's compliance or refusal and then say whether they are"obedient" or "disobedient".  You also have to take into considerationwhether the commands are good or bad.In my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the godDagon, and they all refuse, they aren't being disobedient at all!As far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainlyrefusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But thatalone is insufficient to allow one to label them "disobedient".  Youalso have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.And there's the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have beencommanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have ofcourse disagreed.So where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weakPopes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the onlyway to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what thetraditional teaching of the Church is.The problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea ofwhat is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion ofAmerican Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  Youwill never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic pressin this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine Iget -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of theSociety of Saint Pius X.)Many Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is somesoundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventuallysome Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand,there is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, thePopes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing tohelp the situation by obeying them where they're wrong.  In fact, ifthe situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the veryleast, they're wasting a great opportunity, because they are failingto love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs thisbadly.Schism... let's move on to schism.  What is it?Schism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimatecommand).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But it's a superset, soit doesn't work the other way around: not all disobeyers areschismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don't comply withthe Holy Father's desires doesn't make them schismatics.So what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute aschism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.You must add this: the rejection of the right to command.  Look in anydecent reference on Catholic theology, and that's what you'll find:the distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right tocommand.Here's what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:    ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this    character it must include besides the trangression of the commands    of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.    (from the CE article "Schism")Is the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clearno: they say that the Pope is their boss.  They pray for him everyday.  And that's all that matters as far as schism goes.What all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside theconsideration of the exact nature of their objections, their positionis a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience andschism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because theythink that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching ofthe Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someonewho finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)Now, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read theHoly Father's motu proprio "Ecclesia Dei", you can find out.  It's thedefinitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specificallyPapal act.  It's not the product of a Roman congregation, a letterthat the Pope has possibly never even read.  It's from the Popehimself.  His boss is God... there's no one else to complain to.In this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvreconstituted a schismatic act.2) Archbishop Lefebvre's problem was a misunderstanding of the natureof Tradtion.Both are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Pope's points.As far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interestingarticle in a translation of the Italian magazine "Si Si No No".  Itall gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopalconsecrations imply rejection of the Pope's jurisdiction, then theywould truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunicationunder the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this isthis: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopalconsecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the powerof Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.  Jurisdiction must beconferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as thePope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quitewell, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction overanyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.The "Si Si No No" article was interesting in that it posited that thereason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel,post-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea,episcopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the articleto a friend, unfortunately, so can't tell you more.  I believe theyquoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.The Pope's thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me.There's no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholictheology.  So why does the Pope think this?As far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, here'sthe passage in question:    The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete    and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does    not take sufficiently into the account the living character of    Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,        comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the        help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into        the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes        about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and        study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.        It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which        they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who        have received, along with their right of succession in the        espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.    But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which    opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the    Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to    remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond    with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ    himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.    (Papal motu proprio "Ecclesia Dei", 2 July 1988)It seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that canbe simplified to the following:- Vatican Council II has happened.- I am the Pope.The argument being that either case is sufficient to prove thatArchbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them.This is weak, to say the least!It would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressedArchbishop Lefebvre's concerns in detail.  What is John Paul II'sstand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, PiusIX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed toignore what all these Popes said on the subject?I don't know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in theSSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.--------------------------------------------------------------[Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey"justified disobedience" or even "obeying God rather than man".Calling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice inWonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.Similarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Popesays that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition itexists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break,that there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it willshortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?It seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thingyou are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.  What good will itdo you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but inthe process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of churchdiscipline?  It's one thing to hold that the Pope has misused hispowers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  It's something else tosay that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism isall in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline arenot legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.  Generallyit has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope.While they have often objected to church sanctions, generally theyhave admitted that the sanctions exist.  You are now opening the doorto people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be trulyobeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated.This would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to commandthat you say defines schism.--clh]

I don't often see the attitude of"forgive me and I will try to change".  Instead I see "there's nothingwrong with my life and I can be a good Christian, so it must be you whohave an illness because you don't accept me".  Christians can and willaccept homosexuals, just as they will accept *any* sinner.Sure, it may be natural to some people to be homosexual - but itis also perfectly natural for everyone to sin!  I was born witha desire to sin, but I work to prevent myself from sinning.  It'smuch less common now, but I *still* have urges to lash out inanger.  There also may not be a sudden disappearance of sinfuldesires (or ever!), so it is sad to see people leave the churchwhen they are discouraged that they are still homosexual afterseveral years.-- Darin Johnsondjohnson@ucsd.edu    "Particle Man, Particle Man, doing the things a particle can"

To the people who wrote the Bible and to whom the Bible is written,there is evidence of love, but that is a cultural bias. This isa poor answer which you needn't rebut.I will now pull the old bait and switch.I think you should use the Bible to judge man, not God.By that I mean, if your moral intuition doesn't like whatis described in the Bible, realize that such things are going onnow. I will avoid the semantic arguments about the cause of eviland ask what are you doing to fight it? Not you specifically,but everyone, including myself. If I don't like the genocidein the Bible, what about the genocide that goes on right now?To move beyond the question of a hell, realize that many peopleright now are suffering. If you think hell isn't fair and arewilling to sacrifice everything just to deny its existence,what about how life isn't fair? Right now there is a young motherwith three little kids who doesn't know how she will get throughthe day. Right now there is a sixth grader who is a junkie.Right now there is an old man with no friends and no money tofix his TV. Instead of why doesn't God help them ask why don'twe help them. I think you are correct to challenge any Christianwho doesn't live his life with the compassion you seem to possess.You want evidence of God. Find someone who is making a difference,someone you admire, someone who has been through some tough timesand has come out with his head up. Ask the person how he does it. Ask the Vietnam vet who was battle medic how he kept his mind. Ask the woman who was pregnant at 15, kept the baby and now is a successfulbusiness woman. Ask the doctor who has operated on a 1-1/2 poundbaby. They won't all be Christians, or even what you mightcall religious, but there will be something in common.God is not defined in the Bible, God is defined by what isin those people's hearts. It doesn't matter if you can't giveintellectual assent to any description you've heard, they'reall wrong anyway. The compassion you already feel in your heart is a step in the right direction. Follow that instead.Then come back and read the Bible and you'll see that samething described there.> > If nothing else makes sense, hang on to that idea, that God is love.> > I would say something similar, but in reverse order: love>      is god.Good, I guess we only have to work on your grammar. 8-)Chris Mussack

I am on aninformation gathering venture regarding the various expressions ofChristianity/churches there are.          My husband and I come from very different, but completelyChristian backgrounds.  I was a Lutheran when I met him and he was aborn and raised Church of Christ member.  At first I agreed with a lotof what the C of C was about, I wanted to move from the liturgicalbased Lutheran church to something a little more Biblical based.However over the last year, I've been regretting changing to theChurch of Christ for a number of reasons - for one thing I am not afundamentalist and believe that a few things in the Bible aresocio-cultural in nature and don't relate to the Christian doctrine.One of my sorest spots is the role of women.  I believe that throughMary and other women, Chris validated women as worthy disciples - butin the C of C the writings of Paul are taken without exception and Iam told that I am not an equal partner in my marriage but the lessermember, I am to submit to my husband in all things (if I hear thatverse one more time....) and I am not to take an active role inanything which might be construed as putting me in authority over men(ie leading prayers, conducting Bible studies etc).   The last strawwas when the Elders at our church came down on one of our collegegroups because it was all-women and they wanted a man to lead thestudy.Also my husband and I really resent the way everyone at our churchfeels that if you aren't a conservative republican - you aren't a REALChristian (I got told that nobody who voted for Clinton should callthemselves a Christian).  Hence we are subjected during the service tolong prayers calling for things we flatly dont agree with.  We arealso don't agree with the C of C's dread of any new "movement" beingled by the young people.So, we have been church hunting with NO success.  I want a reasonablybiblical based church where women are viewed as whole people no matterwhat their calling ( C of C really looked down on career women).Christopher is looking for a church with deeply rooted religiousconvictions, with adult baptism and a church where the members stillbring their Bibles to service.We are so confused here and we're drifting around trying to find aplace where we both feel loved and can express our faith honestly andwithout reservation.  If anyone can point us in a direction we'd bethrilled!I'm afraid that it will be very hard for me to go back to C of C andeven harder for me to stay churchless for long.any responses would be welcomethe diel family[I would think somewhere in the Baptist spectrum you might find whatyou're looking for.  However the issue is probably more one of theflavor of the specific local churches in your area than thedenomination -- Baptists cover quite a spectrum.  Adult baptism sortof narrows your choices on the more liberal end of the spectrum.Historically that's been associated with movements that have thecharacter you're trying to avoid.  --clh]

Is this a problem at all?It is possible that the individual saw a true prophetic vision, but that heinterpreted the scale of time and space according to his material con-sciousness, translating the supersensible perceptions of a plane abovethat of time and space into an immediate worldly context -- and getting itwrong.  Not that he did it rationally, but rather that unconsciously theperceptions became clothed in material images, instead of remaining in therealm of the potential and not-yet-time-space-bound.  This difficulty oftranslating prophetic vision into a concrete when and where has always beendifficult, even for the prophets of old.  That is why their prophecies areso often subject to multiple interpretations.  Likewise, the Apostles seemedto feel that the return of the Lord was to be "very soon" in the sense ofperhaps the same generation. Yet the meaning of "very soon" has proven tobe different than they could grasp.  Prophetic vision tends to telescopetime, so that things that are far off appear to be very close.Another possibility is that the vision was one of a real event preparing tohappen, again in the realm of the potential-but-not-yet-manifest and whichwas thwarted by other forces, including possibly an act of divine mercy.There are many concrete prophecies being made these days by devout andsincere and sober Christians (and others too).  It seems that great coming events are really casting their shadow before their arrival in these "apocalyptic" times.  The various predictions (I'm talking about those thatappear to be sincere and sober) are hard to accept, yet hard to ignore com-pletely.  One has the feeling "something is about to start to get ready to begin to commence to happen".  We are living, as the Chinese saying goes,in interesting times.As for how to discriminate, the Bible doesn't help much.  There is an OldTestament passage (I forget where it is) that says you will know whethera prophet is true by whether or not his prophecy comes to pass.  Thathelps eliminate the failures after the fact, but in the case of an earth-quake it is small comfort.  It seems to me that all prophecies that givespecific times and places and events should be suspect, not in that theyare necessarily false, but in the sense stated above, that all such visionsare subject to mistranslation from the plane of prophetic vision to theplane of earthly time and space.For what it is worth, Rudolf Steiner once was asked whether a modern initiate could see into the future and predict coming events.  His answer was that it would be possible but then he would have to withdraw from active parti-cipation in them, including proclaiming what he saw.  If this is in facta spiritual law, then the answer to your question about how to discriminateis that the one who makes such prophecies is probably violating that law,knowingly or unknowingly, and as such his message should be considereda priori to be dubious.  I.e. I would expect that those capable of makingtrue predictions and giving accurate expression to them would not do so in the way that the prophet of the Oregon earthquake did.  However, I cansympathize with the person who published the prophecy. Given the sameoverwhelming experience that he apparently had,  I too might feel impelled, and even commissioned by God to tell my fellow human beings about what I had seen.Gerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)[Do any of our church historian readers know whether there's anymore prophecy now than there has been in the past?  I don't getthat impression.  --clh]

Matthew 25 talks about the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. Revelations20 and 21 reference this fire as the place where unbelievers arethrown. Matthew 18 talks about being thrown into the eternal fire andthe fire of hell. It seems quite clear that there is this place wherea fire burns forever. From the Revelations passages it is clear thatthe devil and his angels will be tormented there forever. From theMatthew 25 passage it doesn't seem abundantly clear whether thepunishment of unbelievers is everlasting in the sense of final orin the sense of continual.  From Dale's question, I come away with the suggestion that hell,if it were short, might be an acceptable alternative to livingforever with the Source of Life, Peace and Joy i.e. the unbeliever ceases to exist. Whereas, if punishment goes oncontinually, then one should have a greater motivation to avoid it.It definately seems to me that hell is something we want to avoidregardless of its exact nature. There seem to be two main questions in Dale's thought:What is God's main plan on earth?Why is continual punishment a necessary part of hell as opposedto simply destroying completely those who refuse God?I believe that God's main plan is to have a genuine relationshipwith people.The nature of hell and the reasons for its nature seem a lot moredifficult to ascertain. It does seem clear that hell is somethingto avoid. At a minimum, hell is the state one is in when one hasnothing to do with God.In the Bible, I am not aware of any discussion about the specifics ofhell beyond the general of hot, unpleasant and torment. For instance,it is not discussed how (if at all) the rich man cancontinually stay in the fire and still feel discomfort or pain orwhether there is some point at which the pain sensing ability isburned up. If you can forgive the graphicalness, if you throw aphysical body into a fire, assuming the person starts out alive,at some fairly quick point, the nerves are destroyed and pain isno longer sensed. It is not stated what occurs when at the judgement,the unbelievers, (who are already physically dead) are cast into helli.e. they no longer have a physical body so they can't feel physicalpain. What could be sensed continually is that those in hell areto be forever without God.  The Lazarus/rich man parable is told with the idea of having the listenerthink in physical terms in order to get the point that some peoplewon't listen to God even after he rises from the dead. The point ofthe parable is to reach the hard-hearted here who are not listeningto the fact of the resurrection nor the Gospel about Jesus Christ.It seems reasonable to also draw from the parable that hell isnot even remotely pleasant.-- Peter Whitedisclaimer: None of what is written necessarily reflects      a view of my company.Phil    I want to know Christ and the power of his3:10 resurrection and the fellowship of sharing inNIVhis sufferings, becoming like him in his death

Karma is considered tobe a moral process in which intentions (either good or evil) shapea person's predilections for future intention and action andproduce a person who is more prone to good than evil, or the opposite --"reward" has nothing to do with it.  Both Jainism and Buddhism are atheisticso there is no deity to dispense rewards or punishments.  Karma is usuallydescribed in terms of seeds and reaping the fruit thereof.  In fact "As yousow, so shall you reap" is found in the Pali Canon as I recall, the metaphorof natural growth is explicit.Hinduism, or some sects in that tradition, are I believe much moredeterministic and involve concepts closer to reward and punishment beingtheistically inclined.In point of fact, the Theravadin Buddhist tradition of Southeast Asiaconsiders karma as only one of five influences in human life, and infact from their point of view they would be unable to explain the mechanicsof karma without the element of free will.Also in Eastern religions there is a difference between reincarnation andrebirth, which is essentially absent in Western considerations.Isn't Origen usually cited as the most prestigious proponent of reincarnationamong Christian thinkers?  What were his views, and how did he relate themto the Christian scriptures?Jack Carroll

No time now to think of ....... religion," Alas, he had found time to die.And I saw a Great White Throne.Now, some have protest by saying that the fear of hell is not good formotivation, yet Jesus thought it was.  Paul thought it was.  Paul said, "Knowing therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men."Today, too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some ofit is nothing but evangelical salesmanship.  We don't tell people anymore, thatthere's such a thing as sin or that there's such a place as hell.  As Jayne has said, this doesn't mean we have to come on so strong so as to hitpeople over the head with a baseball bat.  Yet the fact remains, there is aplace called hell.  A place so fearful that God died to save us from having toexperience it.  Whatever you or I, as Christians, do, we should do whatever wecan to win people to the Lord, if for no other reason, to keep them from goingto "outer darkness.".  Jesus, in Mt. 25, tells us that He didn't prepare hell for people.  He preparedit for the Devil and his angels.  No where in the Bible do I read -anywhere,that God predestined anybody to go to hell.  D.L. Moody use to say that theelect are the "whosoever will" and the nonelect are the "whosoever wont's." Whether or not that's theologically sound, I couldn't defend, but itspractical.  Jesus said to the people of Israel, "Ye would not."  Now, some of you may not be students of the Bible, heck -some of you may not beChristians.  Have you ever said to somebody, "I don't believe in hell.  Ibelieve in the religion of Jesus."  But did you know that Jesus talked moreabout hell than He did about heaven!  "Oh I believe in the religion of thesermon on the mount."  You find hell taught by Jesus in the sermon on themount.  You'll read that Jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire. Several times he talks about hell and about judgment.  In fact, over and overin the synoptics, Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus talks about hell.  Not Isaiah. Not Moses.  Not John the Baptist, though he did, but Jesus, the Son of God. The great Beloved One preached about hell because He loved people and didn'twant to see them go there.Now, if there is no hell then Jesus preached in vain.  It was our Lord Jesus,not some angry Baptist preacher, that said, "where the worm never dies, andwhere the fire never goes out."  Jesus said that.  It was Jesus who called hella "furnace of fire."  It was Jesus that used the word, "condemnation."  "Andthis is the condemnation, that men love darkness rather than light becausetheir deeds are evil.  Jesus said that.  How can we get it across to you that a loving, dying Jesus preached about hell? Not only that, but He went through hell.  That's what Calgary was all about. When my Lord was on the cross, darkness fell.  He called hell, "outerdarkness."  Do you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling overhere, the drunks are getting drunk over there, and the prostitutes areprostituting their bodies over there?  That's not what hell is.  Hell's not aparty.  There's no fellowship there.  He called it "outer darkness."  "Outer"-away from God.  "Darkness" -God is light.  No when He was on the cross, He was made sin for you and for me.  God treatedJesus the way sinners have to be treated.  That's is a sobering thought.  As myson would say, an "awesome" thought.  "My God, My God why hast Thou forsaken me?"  Hell is isolation.  There's nofellowship in hell.  There's no friendship in hell.  There's no loving embracein hell.  There's no hand shake in hell.  There's no word of encouragement inhell.  "I thirst."  It goes much deeper than physical thirst.  Hell is eternal cravingwith no satisfaction.  The man whose life was lived for drugs, will crave iteternally.  The man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman's body, willcrave it eternally -and not be satisfied.  One theologian has put it this wayand I think it deserves merit.  What is hell?  Hell is just the kind ofenvironment that matches the internal condition of the lost.  In a recent post, I was trying to remember the founder of The Word of Lifeministries.  I've remembered his name, Jack Wertzen, and found that theillustration that I gave wasn't his.  His illustration was that he was talkingto his barber and his barber's wife and daughter had just recently been savedand he was commenting about it to Jack.  "They sing these songs and read Bibleverses, and their praising this and that -I can't stand it!  Jack, do you thinkGod would send me to hell?"  Jack answered by saying, "Yes I think he would!" Of course the barber said, "What do you mean by that."  "Well if you can'tstand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises toGod now, what would you do in heaven where they'll do it for eternity?  You'dbe miserable.  Because God loves you, He'd put you where it would match whatyou really are."   It makes a man think.The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a fact that necessitates the eternalexistence of hell because on the cross He performed an eternal act.  Don't askme how, I don't know.  But He is God and He is the infinite/eternal and when Hedied, He died an infinite/eternal death.  It is by that eternal act that Hepurchased eternal life for the "whosoever wills."  He suffered eternaljudgment.  A lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying "Everybody is goingto be saved eventually."  -universalism.  My Bible says no, He'll separatethem.  The sheep from the goats.  ".After you die there's a probationary periodin which God prepares you for heaven."  No, my Bible says that "It is appointedunto men once to die and then comes judgment."  Some of the cultist believe inannihilation.  After you die, sssswish.  Just like a mosquito you're squishedout.  No, in Rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just asthere is in heaven.  I don't enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you don't enjoylistening to them, but we have to preach the entire Word of God.  -There is aplace called hell.  If I could give one verse of Scripture that could give anyhope that people aren't going there, I'd give it to you, but I haven't foundit.  That fact that there is a place called hell, the fact that our God is aGod of holiness and must judge sin, the fact that He has made us the kind ofcreatures we are and therefore we're responsible, the fact that He has placedus in a "uni"verse that has purpose and design behind it, the fact that sin issuch an awful thing and the fact that God Himself went through hell to save usfrom hell leads us to two applications.1)  As I've already mentioned.  If you are a Christian, you must worn others. Its not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that justaround the bend the bridge is out.  "Knowing therefore the terror of Lord, wepersuade men."2)  If you haven't accepted Jesus are your Savior, you're taking an awfulchance.  As I say to the Jehovah Witnesses (who no longer frequent my door), ifyou are right and I am wrong, then I will have lived a good life and will dieand cease to exist, but if I am right and you are wrong, then you will die andsuffer eternal damnation.  I don't mean to make fun at this point, but its likeDirty Harry said, "You've got to ask yourself, 'Do I feel lucky?'  Well doyou?"  "A man's got to know his limitations."  Don't be one of the "whosoeverwont's."  "Because while I was yet a sinner, He died for me.""There's no greater love than this, that a man lay down his life for another."--Rex

But this is not what he did.If you look at the text, he did not speakof spiritual re-birth but of spiritual birth.  We areborn of the Spirit once, not twice or several times.We are also born of the flesh once.  The Lord makes itclear that these are separate and different events.It is true that other Scriptures refer to spiritualbirth as re-birth because it is a second birth(for example, Titus 3:5).  But it is not a second*spiritual* birth.The only thing the two births have in common is the concept of birth,which is used as a symbol of `new life' -- not of innocence.  When aninfant is born (or conceived) a new life is begun--but it is neitherinnocent nor righteous.  Similarly when that same individual isbaptized, or perhaps when they believe prior to baptism, they begin anew life in Christ (Romans 6:3, Colossians 2:12, Titus 3:5, Ephesians2:5).  Then the believer has God's assurance of the forgiveness oftheir sins, and of Christ's imputed righteousness.For references, see The Augsburg Confession Article II, Original Sin, The Apology to the Augsburg Confession, Article II, Original Sin, the Formula of Concord, Article I, Original Sin, and Luther's Large Catechism, Part 4, Baptism.

Hence, thosewho were delivered from Egypt, but did not follow Moses (and, by extension,God); the apostate angels; and Sodom and Gomorrah.  Quoting Reike:"Fornication may here, as often in the New Testament,refer to idolatry, while "flesh" (as in I Pet 1:24) denotes human society and its violent attempts at self-exaltation.  Sodom and Gommorrah represent the leadersof apostasy, and the surrounding cities correspond totheir followers." [p. 199]There is no inherent reason to read this verse (7) as literally referringto actual sexual lust for "alien flesh".  Nor is it inherently necessaryto understand it as referring to homosexuality, outside of the circularreasoning that has already concluded that the sin of Sodom is the sinof homosexuality.  The only place that the sin of Sodom is specified, andnot merely inferred, is in Ezekiel 16:49 "This was the guilt of your sisterSodom: she and her daughters had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease,bit did not aid the poor and needy.  They were haughty, and did abominablethings before me; therefore I removed them when I saw it.For the same reason (overliteralizing the text) your correspondent'ssuggestion that the reason the passage doesn't deal with homosexualityis because the guests were angels and not men is just silly.  There are much more solid reasons for pointing out the irrelevance of theSodom passages for dealing with homosexuality per se.revdak@netcom.com

God may choose one individual overanother as the fit instrument for his plans, but that does notpreclude that the development of that individual into what he is inthis earthly life is not the result of a longer course of development.I do not, and Rudolf Steiner did not, subscribe to the oriental viewof an inexorable, mechanistic karma determining everything thatbefalls one.  This is a kind of shriveled caricature of a much greaterlaw in the context of which the deed of Christ on Golgotha and theultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as a working ofChrist can be seen as the master theme and, indeed, a new impulse thatwas completely free of karma.  Christ incarnated only once in theflesh, and in that he had no debt of karma or sin.  The orientalconcepts of reincarnation and karma, which are even more trivializedand mechanized in some new age teachings, incorrectly assume JesusChrist to have been the reincarnation of a master.  avatar, etc.Their teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept thecontinuing individuality from one life to the next (e.g. Buddhism).More important, they have no concept of the resurrection of the body,the ultimate continuity of the whole human being -- to ultimateresurrection and judgement on the Last Day.There is another biblical passage that also has a bearing. It is thetenth chapter of John, devoted almost entirely to the man born blind.Clearly here, Jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karmaor that of his parents that led to his blindness, but rather that anew impulse is to be revealed through him.  But note that he does notrefute the disciples' question.  In fact, they ask it as a matter ofcourse, the question being stated as if it were self evident that onlyone of two possibilities existed - it was either the sins of the manhimself, obviously not in this incarnation, or the sins of hisparents.  The fact that they even asked about the first possibility atall indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form ofChrist's answer indicates that he did not disagree with it.There is also Matthew 11:14, where Jesus says straight out about Johnthe Baptist,   "If you care to accept it, he himself is Elias, who was to come."This also emphasizes that the Gospels do not have a positive teachingeither way about reincarnation -- or, in fact, about what happens tothe human being at all between death and the Last Day.  Even Jesus didnot push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it ("Ifyou care to accept it").  So I took care to point out, not that theBible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either, andthat much in both scripture and fundamental Christian doctrine becomesunderstandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way.  Ipointedly used "repeated earth lives" to distinguish a little from theoriental doctrines usually associated with the word "reincarnation".The phrase is Rudolf Steiner's (wiederholte Erdenleben).  He noted toothat the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west, completelyfree from eastern tradition.  It did in the eighteenth and nineteenthcenturies, the most important expression of it being Lessing's "TheEducation of the Human Race".To return to your original point, Paul's statement about Jacob andEsau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karma.And both of these principles receive their fulfillment in theincarnation, death, and resurrection, ascension and return of JesusChrist, in my view.Regards, Gerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)

Karma is not simple reward and punishment dealt out by a "judging   deity".2. Reincarnation is not the same as being born again.3. Reincarnation is not the same as the resurrection of the body.4. Reincarnation and karma do not contradict the fundamental teachings   of Christianity about God, the fall, the being. incarnation, death,   and resurrection of Christ, his coming again, sin, grace, forgiveness,    salvation, and the last judgement.>Isn't Origen usually cited as the most prestigious proponent of reincarnation>among Christian thinkers?

He was not anathematized, to my knowledge, but his writing comes down largely in fragments and quotations from enemies.Perhaps someone else can comment on Origen.  I don't know if thereis a specific statement about reincarnation from him, but from what I doknow about him he probably did hold to the teaching in one form or another.I don't know too much about the history of the idea of reincarnation inthe Church. However, I heard an interesting story about Pope John Paul IIfrom an astronomer who teaches at the University of Cracow.  The Pope likesto go to Poland for a scientific conference every couple of years so hecan relax and talk Polish to friends and fellow countrymen.  My acquaintance,an anthroposophist, related the fact that Woitila knew about Steiner andAnthroposophy from his early days.  Before he became a priest he was anactor in a dramatic company in Cracow whose leader was a pupil of Steinerand based his acting and directing methods on Steiner's indications.  Partof the work was the study of the basic works of anthroposophy.  Well,going to this conference with him a few years ago, the astronomer and anotherPolish anthroposophist thought they would ask the Pope what he thought aboutAnthroposophy.  They chickened out at the last minute, but one of them did askhim what he thought about reincarnation.  The Pope smiled and said, "Actually there have been quite a few good Catholics who believed in reincarnation," and he proceeded to name several from the earliest timesto modern times.  Then he changed the subject. My Polish friend did notsay whether Origen was among those he mentioned.Gerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com) [As far as I know Origen himself was not anathematized.  He wascontroversial, but avoided outright condemnation during his lifetime.However some of his views were condemned at a Council in Alexandria in400 and two councils in Constantinople in 543 and 553.  I am fairlysure the preexistence of souls is one of the doctrines condemned.--clh]

Other-wise, why would Jesus offer "but are like the angels in heaven" as acontrast to the idea of the resurrected marrying and being given inmarriage?  We do not have angel-like natures now, but someday we shall,and when we do, our earthly marriages will be irrelevant.

A.D. 388There are many others.>As the tenets of faith developed, particularly with Augustine, sin was>more and more equated with sex, and thus Mary was assumed to be a virgin>for life (since she never sinned, and since she was the spouse of God, etc.)No.  We have, for instance:    Was there ever anyone of any breeding who dared to speak the name of    Holy Mary, and being questioned, did not immediately add, "the Virgin"?    ...

We surely cannot deny that you were right in correcting the doctrine    about children of Mary ... For the Lord Jesus would not have chosen    to be born of a virgin if He had judged that she would be so incontinent    as to taint the birthplace of the Body of the Lord, home of the Eternal    King, with the seed of human intercourse.  Anyone who proposes this is    merely proposing ... that Christ could not be born of a virgin.                -- Pope St. Siricius, Letter to Anysius, Bishop of                    Thessalonica, A.D. 392Note that St. Augustine's conversion to Christianity was in A.D. 387.  Idon't know offhand when his election as bishop of Hippo was, but I'm quitesure it was after 392.  The belief in Mary's perpetual virginity originatedlong before Augustine's time.  We hold that it originated with the Apostles.Strictly speaking, however, Mary's perpetual virginity is independentof her Immaculate Conception.  Mary could have been Immaculately Conceived and not remained a virgin; she could have remained a virginand not been Immaculately Conceived.>Since we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born with>a predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predisposition>because she did not ever sin, she didn't have original sin.

Prayerfully reflecting on thetruth of Mary's sinlessness, and the means by which God could haveachieved this, the Church arrived at the truth of the ImmaculateConception.  Thus, the Immaculate Conception is not a new doctrine,but the logical result of our understanding of two old ones.The celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception itself wasgiven by Pope Sixtus IV (1471-84) and the Feast was made a preceptfeast of the Church by Pope Clement XI (1700-21).>Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She >refered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old >would have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemed>to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.No.  First of all, Lourdes is private revelation, and doctrine is notbased on private revelation.  The most that private revelation can dois enhance and deepen our understanding of existing public revelation,which ended with the death of St. John the Apostle.Second, the "case for the doctrine" was irreformably sealed in 1854 with the ex cathedra promulgation of the Bull "Ineffabilis Deus" byPope Pius IX.  This meant that the doctrine was formally recognized asa dogma; a dogma, by definition, cannot change and is required to bebelieved by the faithful.The apparition at Lourdes happened in 1858, four years later.  The mostthat might be claimed is that Lourdes gave the infallible proclamationof 1854 a sort of heavenly stamp of approval, but the Church has neverclaimed that, nor shall she.In Christ's Peace,Brad Kaiser(bradk@isdgsm.eurpd.csg.mot.com)  Those who trust in Him shall understand truth,  and the faithful shall abide with Him in love;  Because grace and mercy are with His holy ones,  and His care is with His elect.    -- Wis 3:9 [NAB]

The message of Christ is that each of us are not only good,but great, that we can approach perfection, albeit perhaps through a different technique than you claim Buddhism teaches. Because we donot realize our greatness, we sin. Peter had no problem walking on water until a little doubt crept in.Doesn't David ask in the 8th Psalm "what is man that you [God] should care for him, but you have made him just a little lower than the angels"?I probably exagerate in my mind what a scrawny little kid Davidwas, just as I probably exagerate what a gigantic monster Goliathwas, but David's power easily defeated Goliath's.Remember the rich young man who comes up to Jesus and asks whathe can do to enter the Kingdom, Jesus says follow the commandments.I always picture the smug look on his face as he says he's done thathis whole life, probably anticipating an "attaboy" from the Messiah. Instead Jesus gives him a harder task, sell everythingand follow Him. Jesus is raising the bar. The desciples sayhow can anyone do this if it's so hard even for rich people.Jesus says anyone can do it, with God's help.Jesus says not only can we avoid killing people, we can avoidgetting angry at people. Not only can we avoid committingadultery, we can control our own desires.

I think that Muslimsworship the same God as I do, we can learn from their name "submission".Hindus and Buddhists and Taoists, etc. claim that "God" is impersonal. Is God personal or impersonal? I say yes, but if I think a littlemore my answer is whichever is greater. I think it is greater to be a personal entity, with an individual consciousness, butyou're right that that might be a cultural bias. If I think moreI must admit that God's personal nature is as far beyond myconception as His impersonal nature is beyond the Hindu'sconception. If somehow Jesus could fit into Hindu cosmologythen maybe I wouldn't have a problem, though that is hard to imagine.Are there any former (or present) "Eastern Religion" members here who could comment?Chris Mussack

Put up with anything to prevent sin St. Maria Goretti    Maria was born on October 16th 1890 to Luigi and Assunta Goretti,    the  eldest  daughter  in the family of seven. She was a cheerful    girl, always imitating her parents.  She had but one disire,  but    one wish: to receive our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament.    The date was finally set for little Maria to receive our Lord  on    the feast of Corpus Christi. For Maria, time seemed like an eter-    nity as she  slowly  neared  the  great  day.   When  it  finally    arrived, Fr. Jerome( the priest who was to celebrate the Mass and    give the children their First Holy Communion) delivered a  sermon    onthe  immense love of Jesus Christ for them and the great love    we should have in return for Him. He then warmly  urged  them  to    die rather than commit a mortal sin.    Maria humbly approached the Altar of God and  received  the  Holy    Eucharist.Her  only  sadness  was  the  thought of her father's    absence, who died some time beforehand. As for therest  of  the    day,  Maria remained under the spell of the divine visit; that is    until   -4-    her thoughts changed to when she could go next to Holy Communion.    Thus ended the happiest day of Maria's life.    Over the next twelve months, Maria had changed  from  a  giggling    little girl into a quiet young lady with responsibilities. As her    mother went out into the fields in place of  her  husband,Maria    took  on the ironing, cooking, washing and other motherly duties.    She was doing this not only for her own family, but also for  the    Serenellis, a father and son who lived with the Goretti's, owning    a share in the farm. Although Maria was poorer than all the other    children, she by far surpassed them in virtue. In all thi ngs she    did the Holy Will of God.    During the month of June,  Alessandro  Serenelli(the  son)twice    made advances upon Maria when he chanced to be alone with her. On    both occasions Maria managed to  struggle  free  of  Alessandro's    strong  grip, but on the second, he threatened to kill her if she    even uttered a word to her mother. From this day on, Marialived    in terror, fearing lest Alessandro attack again.    On July 5th 1902, Alessandro left work in the fields  to  "get  a    handkerchief,"  ashe  claimed. He went to the storeroom beneath    the house where Maria, who was outside on the  landing  with  the    baby,  could  hear him fumbling about in with tools. She wondered    what he was doing. It was later learned that he was sharpening  a    91/2"  blade. He went to the house and called for Maria. She told    him she wouldn't go to him unless she knew why she was needed. He    stormed out to the landing and dragged her up to her room. Mar ia    instantly realized what he was up to. "No, No, No! Do  nottouch    me!  It  is a sin, you will go to Hell!" At this point Alessandro    held the knife over Maria's chest, who was now on the floor.    "Will you or will you not?" Maria gathered all her energy."No I    will  not,Alessandro,  no!"   She had chosen her martyrdom over    sin, God over Satan.  Overcome with rage, Alessandro plunged  the    knife  into   Maria's  breast fourteen times.  Finally he came to    his senses and thought Maria was dead.  Frantically he threw  the    knife behind a closet and locked himself in his room.  The crying    of the baby Teresaon  the  landing  brought  theattention  to    Assunta  and the father of Alessandro. As the baby was unattended    and was in danger of falling off, they ran to the house  to  find    Maria,  who,  covered in blood, was dragging herself to the door.    When asked what happened she said Alessandro  stabbed  her.   "He    wanted to make me do wrong and I would not."    The ambulance arrived, then the police who took Alessandroaway.    Asthe  ambulancecarried  Maria to the hospital, a large crowd    followed on foot.  The doctors at the  hospital held no hope  for    poor  little Maria.  The same Fr. Jerome who gave Maria her First    Communion   -5-    came to administer the last rites and to give her Holy  Viaticum.    He asked Maria if she would forgive her murderer.  "Yes.  For the    love of Jesus I forgive him.  I wish for him to one day  join  me    inParadise.   May  God forgive him, for I alread y have." Maria    died at about three o'clock.    Alessandro was tried  and  found  guilty  of  Maria's  death  but    because  of  his  age  he  was  sentenced to only thirty years in    prison.  After eight  years of being a violent prisoner and show-    ing  no regret for his crime, he saw in a dream, in the  midst of    a field of flowers, Maria holding out a bunch of white lilies  to    him.  Soon later he wrote to the local bishop, begging God's par-    don for the grave sin he had committed.  He later gave  testimony    inMaria's  beatification in 1947.  Less than three years later,    on Ju ne 24th 1950, Maria was canonised.  Assunta Goretti was the    first mother ever to be present at her daughter's canonisation.    May St. Maria Goretti helpus  tobe  pure  and  grant  us  the    strength to die rather than commit a mortal sin.    Saint Maria Goretti, pray for us.    by Brendan Arthur-- Internet: simon@giaeb.cc.monash.edu.au  Viva Cristo Rey !! Long Live Christ the King.

I   >would think not.  Hate begets more hate, never love.       If you are questioning whether or not "hating sin" is consistent with   Christianity; I ask you to consider the following Scripture:       Romans 12:9 "Let Love be without hypocrisy.  Hate what is evil, cling                    to what is good."       What is it that Paul, through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit is   calling us to hate?  Would God call us to do something that would   eventually lead to hating our fellow man; especially when he commands us to   do the opposite, to love your fellow man?   >Consider some sin. Now lets apply our "hate the sin..." philosophy and see   >what happens. If we truly hate the sin, then the more we see it, the   >stronger our hatred of it will become. Eventually this hate becomes so   >strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to   >hate the sinner.       That has not been my experience.  I've not found myself hating anybody   as a result of hating the sin that may be in their life.  As a sinner   myself, I find myself having more compassion for the person.  Jesus too,   since the Bible teaches that he was tempted in every way that we are, is   able to have compassion on us when we our tempted and fall.  Jesus is our   very example of HOW to hate the sin but love the sinner.  In the account of   the woman caught in adultery (John 8), Jesus had compassion on the woman;   BUT he also called her to leave her life of sin.  This is what it means to   love sinners but hate their sin; it means loving them unconditionally,   while at the same time calling them to leave their sin.   >In addition, our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and do things   >which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even believe   >what they are doing is a sin).       The blame for this can not always be laid at the feet of the   Christian.  I have seen and been guilty of taking offense by someone merely   pointing out my sin and calling me to repent of it.  It was not unloving   for the Christian to call me out of sin; in fact, I believe it was the most   loving thing that that person could have done.  He loved me enough to want   to spare me the consequence of remaining in my sin.   >After enough of this, the sinner begins to hate us (they certainly don't   >love us for our constant criticism of their behavior). Hate builds up and   >drives people away from God...this certainly cannot be a good way to build   >love.       Again, I don't think that you can lay the blame for this at the feet of   the Christian.  If we have loved them as Jesus loved sinners (exemplified   in John 8) and the sinner hates us for it, then we have done the best we   can.  We will have extended to them the most perfect expression of love and   they will have rejected it.       Now it we hate the sin but forget to love the sinner, then indeed, we   will, ourselves, be in sin.   >In the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our   >neighbors. He doesn't say anything about hate.       I would like to encourage you to do a word study on HATE in the New   Testament.  I really think that you will be surprised.   >In fact, if anything, he commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves.       Criticism is very different from calling a sinner to repent.

His explaination was that while it is possible for a couple to marry without the presenceof a priest, it is important to have it recognized by the Church as soon as it is possible.  Because the Church recoginizes itself as a community of believers, membersof the church, to some degree, are to be held accountableto each other.  To be less hypothetical than that mythicalcouple on the desert island, there are many places in theworld that do not have priests availible for marriageson a regular basis.  Therefore, couples get married withoutthe priest being present, but get the priest to testify totheir marriage when one comes through the area.  I remember a religion teacher in high school sayingthat the marriage ceremony is not for the benefit of the coupleas much as it is for the benefit of the community.  Thus,married couples have some responsibility to the communityto stay married, as divorce sets a bad example for thecommunity.  Also, the couple has vowed to become one withone another--the community should be able to rely on that couple to be as one.While couples may marry without witnesses, they may NOT get anulments without a priest present.  An anulment is simply an admission of the church that whatthey had declared a marriage was not, in fact, a marriageat all, for whatever reason.  So don't start getting marriedin the back seat of a station wagon and giving yourselvesanulments a half-hour later!!I tend to agree with the response back there thatsaid couples become married as soon as they consumate theirmarriage, but I would add that couples should consider theirmarriage consumated if they have sex, whether or not theyintended to be married, assuming they were both willingpartners to the sexual act.  The couple must be preparedto raise any children they may have as a result of thatsexual act with the benefit of both parents.  Sex IS acommitment, I believe, in God's eyes.But I'm digressing....God be with you,Malcusco

"Public heretics, eventhose who err in good faith (material heretics), do not belong to the bodyof the Church" (Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma, 1960, Ludwig Ott, p. 311).All is not lost, however, as you still might belong spiritually to theChurch by your desire to belong to it.  As you said, only God can judgethe condition of a man's soul.  About judgment, on the other hand, St. Paul 1 Cor 5:12) urges Christians to judge their fellow Christians. Following the Apostle's teaching, I judge that you should reconsider   returning to the Christian fold and embrace the God of Abraham, Isaac,and Jacob.  He is the God who lives.  Concerning what you were told about non-believers when you were a catholic,that is true.  As I have posted before, Vatican II (Lumen Gentium, II,   n. 16) teaches: "Those who, through no fault of their own, do not knowthe Gospel of Christ or His Chruch, but who nevertheless seek God with asincere heart, and moved by grace, try in their actions to do His willas they know it through the dictates of their conscience - those too mayachieve eternal salvation."  Responding to your solicitation for opinions on the thinking processesof God, the best I can do is refer you to Scripture.  Scripture is oneof the best sources for learning what can be known about God.  Stick with the best.-- boundary, the catechist no teneis que pensar que yo haya venido a traer la paz a la tierra; no hevenido a traer la paz, sino la guerra (Mateo 10:34, tr. esp. Vulgata Latina)

Please don't talk about Jesus' "parents"--the doctrinal positionsof the church an unequivocally different regarding Mary andJoseph.  I (personally) have never heard of anything beingattributed to St. Joseph other than his sainthood; that is,no reference *ever* to him being sinless, assumed into heaven,immaculately conceived, etc.--all these ideas apply only toMary.2.  I would agree there is very little scriptural evidence for ourdoctrines about Mary.  Needless to say, that presents a significant problem to those who accept the bible as the onlysource of doctrine.  If, however, one turns to the sacred traditions of the undivided Christian Church, there is noproblem finding plently of evidence that it was basically aunanimous belief among the apostles and all the early generation that Mary was assumed into heaven, body and soul,etc. etc.  It wasn't until the reformation that these doctrineswere called into question.  As far as I am concerned (again, mypersonaly feelings) if it's a choice between the apostles orLuther, I'll choose the apostles every time, whether or notit is recorded within the writings that the traditions of menhave determined to be "the bible".Like a said, just a couple of notes.  As is often said, I believe thatwe must agree to (politely) disagree.

We have free will, and   are able to change what happens to us.  However, since God knows   everything, He knows all the choices we will make "in advance" (God   is not subject to time).  Too often arguments pit predestination   against free will.  We believe in both.That last sentence of Steve's is an important one to remember.There are certain things in the Catholic religion that cannot becompletely comprehended by a human being.  Were this not the case, itwould be good evidence that the religion was man-made.In the case of predestination, you have to reconcile two things thatwould at first appear to be irreconcilable: the sovereignty of God'swill over all things, and man's free will in deciding his own fate.Catholics believe in both!  But that doesn't mean that anyone has comeup with a pat reconciliation...I have often thought that Goedel's famous theorem has applicability toCatholic dogma, at least in an analogous sense: there are things thatare true that cannot be proved.  God's intellect is far above ours.There are many truths that we will never be able to understand.

As for the faith that you have, keep thatbetween yourself and God. The person is in luck who doesn't condemnhimself for what he samples. On the other hand, the person with doubtsabout something who eats it anyway is guilty, because he isn't acting onhis faith, and any failure to act on faith is a sin.[As far as I know, Christians (except specific Jewish Christiangroups, and maybe some of the sabbatarians -- both of which are verysmall groups) do not practice circumcision on religious grounds.  Insome countries it has been done for supposed health reasons, but I'venot heard it argued that it is being done because of the Biblicalcommandment.  --clh]

How does one tell if a Second Coming is the real thing, unless theperson claiming to be IT is obviously insane?I'm not saying that David Koresh is the Second Coming of Christ.  How couldsomebody who breaks his word be the Second Coming?  Koresh did promise thathe would come out of his compound if only he was allowed to give a radiobroadcast.  He didn't.  Still it seems to me that he did fool some people.And, from my meagre knowledge of the Bible, it seems that Christians havebeen hard on the Jews of Christ's day for being cautious about acceptingsomebody that their religious authorities didn't accept as the Messiah.So I was surprised that nobody had discussed the difficulty of wanting to beearly to recognize the Second Coming while, at the same time, not wanting tobe credulously believing just anybody who claims to be God.[Mark 13:21   And then if any one says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it. Mark 13:22   False Christs and false prophets will arise and show signs and wonders, to lead astray, if possible, the elect. Mark 13:23   But take heed; I have told you all things beforehand. Mark 13:24    "But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, Mark 13:25   and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken. Mark 13:26   And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory. My understanding of Jesus' answer is that, unlike his first coming,which was veiled, the second coming will be quite unmistakeable.  He'stelling us not to be misled by the other things that have to happenbefore his second coming -- the actual second coming will make hispower openly visible.By the way, from Koresh's public statement it's not so clear to methat he is claiming to be Christ.--clh]

Its scholarship is phony and its assertions spurious.I have not seen this book, though I have had several people quote it in support of some tendentious assertions they were making, so I have become curious about it.I don't want to malign this Hislop fellow, whoever he may be, as I have only heard the arguments at second hand, but both of the arguments seemed to turn on false etymology that SEEMED to be derived from Hislop.I would be interested in knowing more about these things. The first one claimed that the word "church" was derived from the Greek "cyclos", and that it was therefore related to the worship of "Circe".I don't know if Hislop is the source of this assertion, but it does seem to be based on false etymology.The second claimed an etymological relationship between "Ishtar" and "Easter", which seemed to be even more fanciful and far-fetched than some of the wilder notions of the British Israelites.Regarding the latter, as far as I have been able to find out, "Easter" is derived from the old English name for April - "Eosturmonath". The Venerable Bede mentioned that this was associated with a goddess called "Eostre", but apart from that reference I have not been able to find out anything more about her. It also seems that the term "Easter" is only used by the English and those they evangelized. The Germans, for example, also use the term "Ostern", but Germany was evangelized by English missionaries.So I would be interested in any evidence of "Easter" being used for Pascha by people who do not have any kind of connection with the ancient Anglo-Saxons and their offshoots. Such evidence might support the claims of those who appear to derive the theory from Hislop.============================================================Steve Hayes, Department of Missiology & Editorial DepartmentUniv. of South Africa, P.O.
