New York prohibits their use in    large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,    Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They    are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.    Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other    jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.Q:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?A:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,    but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe    to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.    They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently    available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate    more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.    New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected    by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a    detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned    on.Q:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?A:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance    computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target    vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR    system.Q:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be    able to handle it? A:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US    in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a    low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the    direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the    radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.    Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low    power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar    detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,    although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such    capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use    is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:    learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they    are used (or else, don't speed.)Q:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?A:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.    Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.    Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the    military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the    Federal Communications Commission of the USA.Driving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:Q:  What are understeer and oversteer?A:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a    car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)    Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to    be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they    tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',    or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)    Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that    untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into    trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle    in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance    oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing    throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle    may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or    spinning.    Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car    will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the    angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling    and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to    travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle    than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater    slip angle than the front wheels.Q: What is a rev-matched downshift?A: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear   than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally   you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop   rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle   before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to   the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.Q: What does heel-and-toe mean?A: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while   braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot   for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you   use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to   match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;   often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side   on the throttle.   Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the   left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing   the same thing.Q: What is double-clutch downshifting?A: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of   three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for   declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the   transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with   rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch   engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission   speed up.   The procedure is as follows:   (0) declutch   (1) move gearshift lever to neutral   (2) engage clutch   (3) match revs   (4) declutch   (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear   (6) engage clutch   This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.   The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the   synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or   with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.   Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at   all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good   condition.Q: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and   slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?A: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and   2) almost never.   In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times   in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the   same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine   that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite   pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from   driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*   major) part of the equation.   Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really   only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically   when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the   comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.   This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads   are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply   of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.   Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the   automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced   by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the   car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making   a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end   of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car   has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'   setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of   caveats could go on for page after page.Q: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according   to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate   or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?A: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.   2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics   textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,   none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a   stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating   temperature.   Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser   extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a   substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been   coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match   the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire   at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses   inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling   friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire   is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will   be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its   proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some   part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like   to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.   (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal   street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of   high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)   Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,   it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters   accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than   1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible   for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of   grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques   such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.Misc. Questions:Q:  What does <name or acronym> stand for?A:  Here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked    about; be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names    as misinformation abounds on the net.  In particular, NEVER    ask in rec.humor if you want a useful result.    Saab:   Svenska Aeroplan A. B.,              or The Swedish Airplane Corporation    Alfa:   Societa Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili,              or The Lombardy Automobile Manufacturing Company    Fiat:   Fabbrica Italiana di Automobili Torino,              or The Italian Automobile Manufacturers of Turin    BMW:    Bayerische Motoren Werke,              or Bavarian Motor Works    MG:     Morris GarageQ:  Does VW own Porsche?A:  No.  Porsche is a publicly held company, controlled by the Porsche and    Piech families.  Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,    which causes some confusion.  Since currently Porsche is in some    financial difficulty, there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may    be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this    is only speculation at this time.-- richard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith

I may be wrong, but a loaded Tarus beats a Saturn SL2.I agree that a fully-loaded SL2 would come close in price to aLOWER-END Ford Taurus.  A FULLY-LOADED Taurus, on the other hand, would stillbe substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy SL2.  A fully loadedSL2 would run somewhere around $17,000, while a fully loaded Taurus LX would besomewhere around the $22,000-$23,000 range.  A base Taurus (GL I believe) mightstart around $15,000.  Of course there is the Taurus SHO which can push $30,000if you really try, but this is a totally different car than your mainstreamTaurus sedan.

(He said he will replace the components beforeselling the car to me.)Being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars, I don't knowwhat this could mean...Is 96K km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items?Or is this an indication that the car was abused?Would other things break down or have to be replaced soon?The seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot, but,I don't know how to verify this...  I've seen the paint chipped awayin tiny dots in the front edge of the hood, though.Although the Maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean andwell kept, it's currently out of warranty(a similarly priced '90 Accord with 70K km will have 2 years or 30K kmworth of warranty left) and I don't want to worry about paying forany repair bills...But, I also need a car for 5 people...

It gives very low gas mileage (something like           11 miles / gallon ; I hear other car owners speak of           gas-mileage figures like 25 miles/gallon (wow!) etc.).2. When I start the car, it goes into high idling (something           like 1500 (or is it 15000 ?) rpm. After driving 4 or 5 miles,            it comes down to 300 (or 3000?) rpm. I would like to know if there is any way by which I can fix theseproblems. Or is it natural for an old car like this ? (it hasdone about 117,000 miles). Someone suggested that I change/rebuild/recondition the carburettor. I am not prepared to do itunless I am sure it will fix the problem. And yes, I got thecar tuned-up recently (within the last 200 miles or so).Please let me know if you have any suggestions.

My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe>the following to be true:My knowledge about driving in the U.S. is also second-hand, but I think I cancorrect your statements about our Autobahn:>1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here.Oh yeah, that would be paradise... in fact, you can forget it. From all I'veheard from my U.S. relatives, drivers esp. here in Germany are much more agg-ressive, but not disciplined. One of my relatives, a L.A. resident, hired a carat the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home. He said then thathe grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore he'd never drive a car inGermany again (this was in 1982 and he kept his promise - the situation now iseven worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic).What you mean by `better disciplined' should perhaps be considered `cautious dueto fear': When driving around here, you always *have* to take into consideration that themajority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you: They expect that nobodyfails or sleeps; many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car cango (of course only where that is allowed, you might think - dream on :).So any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health - and if you're ex-posed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver, you learn tohandle it - or you lose... That's the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation - whether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you; I think we handlea very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest (compared tothe volume) and decreasing rates of lethal accidents - OTOH, more and morepeople (esp. women) dislike driving (because they feel overtaxed and threatened)and each accident is one accident too much.>2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than>   they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them>   far more predictable than most US highways.Better designed and maintained, may be - but animal fences are very rare. Auto-bahnen and many other streets have guard-rails (I hope that's the right word - a plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights; it's about 2 feet high);those guard-rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road. Smaller animalscan crawl under the plank, bigger ones can easily jump over it. The point isthat esp. larger animals are very rare in Germany; they tend also to be verytimid. Accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger.>3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have>   speed limits that aren't out-of-line with what we used to have in>   the US -- if my friends weren't lying to me they're typically not>   much higher than 120km/h.You're right (there are speed linits even on the major part of the Autobahn) -but the attitude towards driving (see above) seems to be very similar to thatin Germany (I've been in France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Spain, Belgium,the Netherlands) - besides that, you really can't rely on the residents abidingthe local speed limits. I've got quite a lot of practise (~120k miles) and I'mused to travel at 130 mph (FYI, with a car even smaller than a rabbit), but Iconsider driving on the highways round Paris or Milano really a thrill...>I strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph>(nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong. ...Sorry, but you'll find quite a lot rabbit-class-car (or even smaller, mine is aPeugeot 205) owners going that fast; small cars with much HP are very `hip' overhere - and most people buying such cars aren't afraid to let them run.>                                                      ...  Some people>have no respect for their own lives.I disagree; the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant. Formula-1 carsweigh less than 700 kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at130 mph or higher - OTOH when crashing against a solid object at 130 mph,it makes no difference whether you sit in a Porsche, a Mercedes, a tank or ona bicycle: Your're dead.Bye,Stefan---Stefan Dalibor (dalibor@immd3.uni-erlangen.de)--------------------------------------------------------------------------"...And now for the next case in Kangaroo Court, I accuse you of being thereincarnation of Adolf Hitler.

The dealertold us it is because to change the oil filter on a SVX it is necessary todisassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour.At first, we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in Torontobut found out the they are charging roughly the same price.  So is there anySVX owner out there that has the same problem ?  And if the oil change story istrue, then the engineer of Subaru looks pretty stubid to me. By the way, the carlooks great.SWD Wan.

Years ago in anothertime and place, I used to do oil changes in boats powered by automotiveengines.  In many cases, there was no way to get any sort of a tray underthe oil pan because it was boxed in by the bottom of the hull and variousfloation chambers on each side.  And if you *did* get something there, you'dspill all the oil out of it for sure trying to get it back out again.So we used a small pump powered by an electric drill to suck the oil outthe dipstick hole.  There was a long/thin hose on the inlet side designedto fit down the dipstick tube, and another, thicker/shorter hose on theoutlet side that you put into any convenient container.

I wrote them a check for the down payment plus taxand license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck.  When I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could  get to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he  started adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had  miscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed  another $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was  their problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then  brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I  reminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be  treated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole  deal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,  snatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by  the turn of events.Early the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting  to know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and  asked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him  that if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,  that there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs  and that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still  pretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to  lose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told  him not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.A couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all  apologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus  knock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about  it and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,  and assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....I thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we  decided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him  back and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the  truck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the  incident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of  there in my new truck in about 30 mins.So, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not  have happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales  person talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I  sure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their  mistake.Anyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred  dollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.  I'm not sure whether I'll go back to that dealer, tho.Mark

So isn't that saving money?Moreover, if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by $1000, then their cars will be even better deals.  Say, if the price of a Saturn wasalready $1000 below market average for the class of cars, then after theyreduce the dealer profit, it would be $2000 below market average.  It will:1) Attract even more people to buy Saturns because it would SAVE THEM MONEY. 2) Force the competitors to lower their prices to survive.Now, not only will Saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit, even the buyers for other cars will pay less.Isn't that saving money?$0.02,doug.

ABouta year ago I found that the master cylinder on the clutch in the '84 was        leaking fluid around the piston seal, leading to air in the system and fluidback into the passenger compartment of the car.  I pulled the plunger andgot a rebuild kit (new plunger, seal, etc.) and thought I had the problemlicked.  Much to my surprise, the same problem developed several monthslater!  This time I looked carefully at the master cylinder to make surethere were no scratches, burrs, or other obvious causes of the problem.  Ididn't find any.  Ever since I have been periodically feeding the clutchhydraulins additional fluid and bleeding air from the system.  I knew Iwould be selling the car and didn't want to go all the way to solving theproblem.I should add that the clutch is original, and that I've had to adjust thepedal to allow maximum extension of the piston into the master cylinder inorder to actuate the clutch.My hypothesis is that this means that when fully depressing the clutch pedal,the angle of the piston rod (attached to the pedal) is off the axix of thecylinder, thus cocking the piston and seal and perhaps deforming it.What do you think of that as an explanation?  Can you suggest a possible fixshort of replacing the master cylinder and getting a new clutch put in?Now the '86: same problem, except that the above diagnosis doesn't explainwhy all of the fluid leaked out (by way of the master cylinder, into thepassenger compartment) while I was on vacation for 10 days, during whichthe clutch pedal was not depressed or otherwise caused to distort.  Whatcan you suggest here?Many thanks.  Let's hope I don't end up going to Click and Clack on this...Bill Christens-Barrycerulean@access.digex.com

The result,which they announced with great flourish was that it cost the same at theend of the period.  That was their argument to prove that you don't gowrong buying the Ford Taurus over the Camry.Now, if I remember correctly, the Camry costs about $4000 or so morein initial costs.  Essentially, it means that you spend about $4000 extraon repairs on the Taurus.  That is ridiculous.  Every time your carneeds repairs, it is extra hassles, loss of time and a dozen other things.I would much rather spend $5000 more in initial costs than spend $4000 morein repair costs.------------------->8      Cut here for Signature!       8<---------------------Balaji Ramanathan,                   | Institute of Transportation Studies, |         I don't believe in luck!University of California, Irvine.    |              I RELY on it!!

All opinions, benchmarks,>>>recommendations, etc. are welcome.The Civic does still come in a 4 door model.  My wife and I lookedquite seriously at the 626, Prizm (Corolla), and Civic, as well assome other cars.  Our impressions: all three seemed well built and hadthe features we wanted - these are similar to the features you wantexcept for cruise control, and we want a manual transmission and areconsidering anti-lock brakes.  I also hate automatic seatbelts and weboth think having an airbag is a plus.  In general, comfort andperformance were both significant.Some specific +'s and -'s are listed below.Mazda 626 + very comfortable and roomy + can theoretically get ABS on DX model, though in practice this is   hard to find + base price for base model includes numerous little things like:   tach, variable speed wipers, rear defroster, 60/40 split folding rear seat - more expensive than many other cars listed belowHonda Civic + DX gets significantly better mileage than other cars listed here + comfortable front seat + adjustable seat belt mounting - no ABS without EX model (includes $1000's of other things like a sunroof)Geo Prizm/Toyota Corolla - seats not very comfortable to us (your mileage may vary) + adjustable seat belt mounting + can get ABS without lots of other extrasSaturn + SL2 was quite comfortable, though SL1 less so - motorized attack beltsDodge Spirit   no real outstanding +'s, but seemed generally ok - rear seat does not fold downChevy Corsica + comes with ABS standard - lower "would you buy that car again" and safety ratings in   Consumer Reports (than first 3 cars above) - suspension didn't feel as stiff as the others (this would be a +   for some)The Honda Accord and Toyota Camry were both more expensive than the626, and in our minds, not significantly better.We probably gave disproportionately low consideration to the "big 3",due (a) to my wife's family's general dislike of Chrysler products,(b) some unimpressive GM products owned by my parents and a housemateof mine (c) the Taurus comes with automatic transmission, I find theseat of the Tempo very uncomfortable, and the escort has attack beltsand no air bag.We'll probably end up with a 626 - I saw a 626 DX with A/C andcassette advertised for just under $12800 (Washington Post, April 14,I think), and my local dealer says they can match that price.  I willprobably get the 626 (maybe tomorrow).  The main question in my mindis whether or not I will have to do a "factory order" or "preferenceorder" to get one with ABS, and whether or not the dealership willrun the price up a lot if I do so.

When a friend of mine went shopping for a smallsedan a few years ago, she brought me along as a token male sothe salespeople wouldn't give her the "bimbo" treatment.Her first choice was a Mazda 323, and second choice was a NissanSentra.  We went to a Mazda dealership and described what "we"wanted.  We started negotiating on the price, and the salesdroidkept playing the "let me run this price by the sales manager".  Afterplaying the "good salesman, bad salesman" game, we finally told himthat if he didn't have the authority to negotiate a price, perhapswe should be speaking directly to someone who did.  He brought inthe sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trickin the book.  (Read Remar Sutton's "Don't Get Taken Every Time" for alist.)  Finally, after playing a few more rounds of "you'll have towork with us on this price", also known as "each time you come up athousand dollars we'll come down ten", the salesmanager gave a signal tohis two sales cronies, stood up, and said "well, we can't come down anymore so I guess we can't help you" and they trouped out of the room,leaving us sitting in the salesman's office all by ourselves.  Hmm.I'd read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so theycan leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer, andI mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wonderingwhy they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to thedoor.  For lack of anything better to do, I picked up the phone onthe desk and called another Mazda dealership, asked for a salesman,and began discussing what kind of price they would consider.  A fewsentences into the conversation, Mr. Salesmanager broke into the line(!) and began telling me how rude he thought it was that I would callanother dealership from "his" phone!  I said that since he'd announcedthat our business was over, he shouldn't care, and every time I triedto talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out ourvoices with his own.  (How did he know that I was using the phone,anyway?)  Finally, I hung up and we headed out of the showroom.Sales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and hebegins to berate us again.  We say that we won't bother him anymore,we're going next door to the Nissan dealership.Then comes the part I wish I could have videotaped.  As we go outthe front door, the sales manager SHOUTS across the entire showroom,customers and all, "Go ahead!  You DESERVE to buy a Nissan!"So my friend bought a Sentra.Just so the guilty won't go unpunished, I'll mention that thesales manager's name was Gary Tusone.  From his manner, hisrefusal to come down to a reasonable price, and his anger at theend, my guess is that he had bet our original salesman (who wasa young novice) that he'd be able to get at least X dollars out ofus, and he was steamed that we wouldn't fall for his slimy tricks.

This seems to be a popular scam with dealers.  Last month my brother bought a new Audi 90 series quatro from a local dealer.  They came back with the final price, tax and all, and he added it up for himself.  There happened to be an extra $300 tagged on under the tax part. He pointed out their error and asked them to re-think their addition.  They came back with the right price the next time.

My head hit the roof, Fun on bumps, no? Also hasa cheap-looking interior.Isuzu Trooper:Class act. This is a really, really nice vehical. Very comfortable,handled ok. Has really cool grab handles EVERYWHERE. But it's huge,and the engine is a bit too small for it's bulk; also the manual shift is weird and kind of awkward. I'd buy this if it were $3k cheaper or 10"shorter. But at this size and for this price, no. I kept picturing trying to park in in San Francisco. No Thanks.Chevy Blazer:Cheap looking. Small. Not as small as the Toyota and Nissan, but still too small.Ford Explorer:This is no sports car, and it's certainly not for the serious off roader.But it's big enough to be comfortable without being as huge and heavy as thetrooper. It's engine has plenty of power for everyday driving, though it wouldbe nice if it had a *bit* more. The automatic tranny is pretty nice; head andshoulders above my '90 mazda MPV. The steering is not as tight as I'd like,but it's acceptable. The two door has easy-to-enter back seats (Easier to getinto, in fact, than the driver's seat of the 4runner!) and with a 10" shorterwheelbase and the easier availability of a manual tranny, (Yes, I'm a manual shift biggot, I admit it...) it's the one I'm thinking of buying. So, that said, is there anyone out there who has one of these and hates it?Anyone had any major problems? Heard any horror stories?

All of the things you mentioned will just give you headacheslater on.  ALso it sounds like the car needs a lot of work and as you probablyknow BMW's are not cheap to fix either.  The owner sounds like a shadycharacter just trying to take advantage of someone. Sure $ 3000 sounds goodbut you should calculate how much the repairs will be. It sounds like youwould have to sink in at least $ 1000 to get everything fixed if not more.Also never trust anyone as far as mileage is concerned. Who knows how manymiles are on it and how it was driven.  Sure people tell you BMW's hold up butyou have to consider any car is subject to wear and tear. For all you know itcould have 200,000 miles on it.  The thing you have to remember is that thisisn't the last 528i around either. Just wait and keep shopping. For around $5000-6000 you can probably find one that is better, needs less repair, and haslegitimate mileage unlike the one you are considering. Take it from a guy whohas been taken a couple of times. Good luck.Al Himsl

So after I've flashed my lights at the chap in front and he doesn't'pass it on' (and few if any do), what next? On major highways, 3 or morelanes in each direction, keeping to the extreme right blocks folks whoare entering. Also, as someone posted in this thread, here in the D.C.area we have a few left lane exits (sounds like 66). If you wait untilthe last minute to get in the left lane you won't, cause these yoyoswon't make room.We have a particularly bad strech here in Merryland just over the CabinJohn bridge. There are two very long entry ramps which all the hurry-upyahoos dive into cause they want to get ahead. When we get to the pointwhere these ramps merge, all hell breaks lose. The result is that trafficwhich was moving at 55 on the VA side of the bridge, stalls on t'otherside. If these dingbats had stayed in lane, allowed the folks coming upthe two ramps to merge, we would still be doing 55. Instead we do start-stop for 4 miles. Dave Barry's idea of a laser equipped car would bereal useful here.BobPS: If you drive the beltway and want to merge, look for a brown Probewith a silver haired driver, then use your signals - I don't read minds,but I do try to be courteous. They told me courtesy was contagious, butI guess the folks around here have had their shots :-/

Your problem in the wet is call hydroplaning.You may not have enough tread left to channel water out from under thetire - so it goes fishy on you as it lifts off the road.(2) Tires age. In particular, soft tire compounds get harder as you putthem thru more heat cycles. Harder compounds don't grip as well assoft ones. Effect is very noticable on tires that get very hot veryoften, such as in competition, but it hits all tires.Bob Benson

Wrong paint type (vetts used lacquer)  An modification would reduce tthe value.  But your looking for a car to drive right?This sounds like a ball park price for a small-block (327 cu in.) / manual / no air car.  A 427 would put it closer to $30K.Get it appraised!!!  For insurance purposes also.

The car has a 5 speed manual tranmission.Since the car was bought new, while shifting from 2nd to 3rd,  unless I do it SLOWLY and carefully, it makes a "popping" or "hitting" sound.The dealer and Mitsubishi customer service (reached by an 800 #) say this is NORMAL for the car.  IS IT?And about a year ago, at 35Kmiles, the stick shift handle got STUCKwhile attempting to put it in reverse:   1- The shifter would not budge.  The clutch had no effect.   2- The front tires would not budge, even when the clutch is      fully depressed.   3- If the clutch is released the engine would die.   4- Assuming that some gear was engaged while the shifter was      stuck, I could not make the car move.  It acted as if      it were in Neutral(except for dying when clutch is released.)   5- I finally was able to release the shifter by having       someone rock the car back and forth (less than an inch),      while I depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter.   6- The shifter acted normally after that.When this happened, I took it to the dealer, they checked the clutch, it was o.k. They checked the transmission, it was o.k.I had the exact problem a couple of months ago, and again lastweek.  The dealer says there is nothing they can do because Mitsubishi (the 800 #) says they have never heard of theproblem, and the dealer could not reproduce the problem whilethey had the car.  In all three occurances, the car was parked head first in a garage,and since the front wheels were stuck, the car could not be towedto the dealer before releasing the shifter (hence temporarilysolving the problem).  And the dealer, and Mitsubishi, refused tosend someone to check the car while it was stuck. I KNOW there is smething wrong with the transmission (shifting from 2nd to 3rd), and getting stuck at random, but I can't get the dealer to fix it. I need your help with the mechanical problems, and with how to handle Mitsubishi.  All hints and suggestions are greatly appreciated, and sorry tobore you with the long post.Thanks,Rabih.

Only 120,000 dollar cars should be driven fast.>They drive goddamn Rabbits at 120 MPH in Europe, pal, and I reckon>a Taurus is at least as capable as a Rabbit.My whole point was not to say that the cars *couldn't* go that fast,but that they *shouldn't* go that fast.  A family sedan designed to beoperable at 85mph doesn't suddenly become operable at 130mph becauseyou added some plastic aero effects, slightly wider tires, and a muchlarger engine.  That's what the SHO is -- a slightly modified familysedan with a powerful engine.  They didn't even bother improving the*brakes.*The Mustang is essentially the same deal as the SHO -- a big powerplant stuck in a mid-size sedan, with almost no other modifications.I have real-life experience with the Mustang -- it handles like abrick (except when you're invoking oversteer, of course, something Ipersonally avoid doing on the highway) and stopping power isinadequate even from 80mph.  Lots of accelleration -- but the rest ofthe car is not up to par.I picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed inmind.  It didn't have to be the 911 -- it could have been the muchcheaper 944 or one of several Mercedes or Audi models.  All of thesecars are fairly expensive -- but so are the parts that make themdrivable at high speed.  This should be elementary.There are a few things to keep in mind about Europe, since you broughtit up.  My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believethe following to be true:1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here.2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than   they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them   far more predictable than most US highways.3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have   speed limits that aren't out-of-line with what we used to have in   the US -- if my friends weren't lying to me they're typically not   much higher than 120km/h.I strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph(nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong.  Some peoplehave no respect for their own lives.>>You certainly haven't convinced me.>Of course not.  "Speeding-is-bad.  Speeding-is-illegal. >I-will-not-speed.  I-love-Big-Brother."

Thepull-off, which is vacuum actuated, provides a necessary pull in non-coldweather conditions to get the idle off the the fast idle cam. Locate thefast idle cam on your vehicle and see if you can rotate it to produce anormal idle. If so, locate the diaphram and test it. If you can't applysuction (via a good piece of rubber vacuum hose) with your mouth that willcause the diaphram to retract, then it's bad and should be replaced.Bernie LofasoApplied Research Labs

In between '91 and '92, the instrument pannel of the car has been replaced and the odometer also has been resetto zero.  Therefore, the true meter reading is the reading beforereplacement plus current mileage.  That shows 35000 mile differencecomparing to the mileage on the odometer disclosure from.  The dealer never told me anything about that important story.I hope that I can return the car with full refund.  Do u think thisis possible?  Does anyone have similar experiences?

I'd driven it sincethe previous July, putting 20k miles on it.  The sensor light used tolight up regularly, starting about 5k miles after I bought it.  My brother and I rebuilt the engine but used all of the original equipment,so I suppose the sensor could have used replacement.  Performance (hah,if you could call it that) did not change.

Drivess well, sounds good,body is OK, he wants $3000.i liked the car, despite it's auto tranny, but my wife will be a primarydriver on this one, and she wants auto.The radio does not work untill the car warms up and you honk the horn (!)The A/C seems to have a leak. The sunroof is sticky, but operational.Odometer does not work, as mentioned before.Idle is a bit bouncy, going from 900rpm to 1200rpm.Wipers are slow.That's teh gripes. The owner says that he changed radiator, alternator, rotors and calipers, exhaust.The biggest problem, is that the owner is a shifty SOB, telling strangestories. I hate that. I would never buy from a persom like that, except, howoften you see a descent 528i for that amount of money. He also said that,although I could bring a mechanicin, he wouldn't let me check the car by taking it to a garage. Suspicious. And who knows what milage is on it.So, let me know what to check for, given there's practically no rust.I know there was an article on 528i in R&D a few years back, anybody rememberswhat issue?Mike.S

There are two bluebook prices, one forretail and one for wholesale.  You really want the retail price if you can get it.  The blue books also have adjustments you can make for low mileageand extras on your particular car.  You should look all this stuff up yourself.Also keep in mind that the blue book prices are averages over the countrythat may not apply in your area.  For example, blue book prices are low forCalifornia.  A better way of finding out how much your car might be worth isto call around and see what it's selling for (if any used lots have one) orlooking in local papers for similar cars and checking out the prices.  It might be more time efficient to take a small loss (rather than hold out for6 months for the best price).>an acquaintence>has offered to give me blue book value for the car.I don't know what you mean by "an acquaintance" but I would make darn surethat I was paid, that is, cashier's check in full before delivery.  There'sa real temptation when selling to a pseudo-friend to be more accomodatingthan you should.  Make sure you get the money and if they hedge about payingin full at the start (with a cashier's check or cash) then I would goelsewhere.  Rememeber that you can probably sell your car to a used car lotor wholesaler and get wholesale bluebook.

I bought it in California, and ifit'll let me, I'd like to keep it for another year.  The only problem is theseIndiana winters--my heater controls don't work.The car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents.  Right now it isstuck in the "vent" mode.  It will blow warm air, but I can't switch the airflow to either the floor (I can live without this) or the defrost (I can't live without this).  I probably could just jam the air deflector to the defrost position, but this blows a lot of air in my face and is, well,kind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse.I have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and I thinkthe problem (or part of it) is with the two diaphragms which control up/downand outside/inside air flow.  THe diaphragm which controls outside(vent)/in-side(no vent) air is cracked most of the way around, and the other one isprobably damaged too, considering the advanced age of the car.Two questions:1)  Is there anything I should be aware of about this (other thanthe fact that I should move from Indiana) ?2)  In the event that replacement diaphragms aren't available, is therea way to "fix" this?THanks for any advice/infoselah,Danlovall@physics.purdue.edu

When that light goes on, I justtake it to the delaer tell them "It's that time" and they work on it for 4 houand you pay $5 for parts and $100 for labor. (Ahh...what they get for labor)I currently have about 95K on my Sprint and of all the times I took it in forservice, I never say on the payment sheet anything about the replacement of theOxygen sensor.  What the heck is an Oxygen sensor?  As far an I know of, I havenever had that thing replaced in my car and the car is purring like a kitten.Now, I don't have a/c (Mother Nature does that for me :-) ) and that might havesomething to do with it, but I still never heard of an Oxygen sensor.  The onlyMAJOR service job I have had on my car (besides getting the tires replacedif you want to call that a service job) was getting the Rotor, Distributor andGasket replaced.  And that was all done within the past 2 months.  What I do at 30K is have a good tune-up, let them replace what ever they needto, pay the bill (about $125) and go home and don't worry about the car foranother 30K.  Oh, I just remembered something.  If that little sensor lightbothers you, in the fuse box right below the turn-signal lever up againstthe dash, there is a swith on the right side.  Flip that switch and the lightwill go off.  I do that so that little light won't annoy me.  If you can'tfind it, look it up in the car manuel.  I hope that I have helped a littleand good luck with the _Oxygen sensor_?- Thomas -*******************************************************************************  E-Mail Address:   *  "Give me an an army of West Point,      **TJZ6624@ZEUS.TAMU.EDU  *   graduates and I'll win a battle...     **  *   Give me a handful of Texas Aggies,     **  "Creator of MOT POWER!"  *   and I'll win a war."                   **  *  - Gen.

BTW, Talking with the dealer I bought the car from got menowhere.  After being routed to a "Firebird Specialist", I was ableto confirm that this is in fact the case.At first, there was some problem with the 3:23 performance axle ratio.She wouldn't go into any details, so I don't know if there were someshipped that had problems, or if production was held up because theysimply didn't have the proper parts from the supplier.  As I say, shewas pretty vague on that, so if anyone else knows anything about this,feel free to respond.  Supposedly, this problem is now solved.Second, there is a definate shortage of parts that is somehow relatedto the six-speed Manual transmission.  So as of this posting, there isa production hold on these cars.  She claimed part of the delay wasnot wanting to use inferior quality parts for the car, and thereforehaving to wait for the right high quality parts...  I'm not positivethat this applies to the Camaro as well, but I'm guessing it would.Can anyone else shed some light on this?Chris S.-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Chris Silvester      | "Any man capable of getting himself elected Presidentchriss@sam.amgen.com |  should by no means be allowed to do the job"chriss@netcom.com    |   - Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Energy Secretary Hails President's Plan For Alternative FuelVehicles To: National Desk, Environment and Energy Reporters Contact: Larry Hart of the U.S. Department of Energy, 202-586-5806   WASHINGTON, April 21  -- Secretary of EnergyHazel R. O'Leary today said President Clinton's Executive Order onAlternative Fuels will make the federal government a "driving forcebehind efforts to increase the availability of both alternativefuel vehicles and fuel supplies."   President Clinton signed the order today, which calls forfederal purchases of alternative fuel vehicles in numbers over thenext three years at least 50 percent higher than those called forin the Energy Policy Act of 1992.   President Clinton also announced that Texas Land CommissionerGary Mauro will head up the Federal Fleet Conversion Task Force toadvise O'Leary on implementation of the Executive Order.   "I am delighted that I will be working with Gary Mauro to makethis happen," O'Leary said.  "As Land Commissioner, Gary Mauro hashelped make Texas a national leader in converting the state fleetto alternative fuels, and has been a tireless proponent of naturalgas vehicles in speeches across the country."   The task force is to issue a report within 90 days recommendinga plan and schedule of implementation.   "The Department of Energy and all of us in government must leadby example if the option of alternative fuels is going to become apractical, affordable choice for fleet owners across the country,"O'Leary said.  "Increased use of domestically-produced alternativefuels means reducing pollution while creating jobs.  We believethat energy efficiency, protecting the environment, and a healthyeconomy are complimentary goals."

I have never had any major problems with other car/trucks in the past(maybe a ding once in a while). I went to the dealer and he said that ithappens all of the time and he recomended putting a bug deflector on thehood. He said that the trucks, for some unknown reason, seem to have thisproblem more than some cars.? It seems to me that either my luck is really bad or there might be a problemwith the paint (painted on a monday morning perhaps?).  How well do these bug deflectors work for small road debris on trucks?  If anyone has any experiences/suggestions please let me know, thanks. --Greg  thorn@wam.umd.edu

Gas is much more expensive, so people are veryconcerned about it taking a few more liters per kilometer.  This,along with narrow old cities, also results in smaller cars withsmaller engines.  These engines usually don't have the torque to meshwell with an automatic.  So, having engines that don't work well withautos, and a great concern for milage, the usual Euro-car has amanual.(Note that not many big Benzes come with manuals.  If you've got themoney for the car, you've got the money for the gas, and the engine todrive through the slushbox.)As automatics become more efficient, the "bigotry" is probablyreduced.  Still, everyone knows how to drive a manual, and cars arecheaper with one, and it saves a little expensive fuel.  So therearen't compelling reasons to go automatic.-dB--

Here in the states, people simply do not expect when they are driving to be overtaken at a speed differential of 50+mph.  I don't think this is because they are stupid (of course, there are exceptions), they are just programmed because of the 55mph limit. Do you (in the states) when you look in the rear-view ALWAYS calculate future  positions of cars based on a 50+ speed differential.  Dont get me wrong, I love to drive in the left lane fast but when I overtakecars who are on the right, I slow down a tad bit. If I were to rely on the judgement of the other car, to recognize the speed differential, I would be the stupid one.  BTW, If no one else is around, then GO FOR IT!.

This articlewill provide the essential information for doing so on standardUnix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setupsare included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.comfor a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotivemailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I canlist it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of theUsenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)First of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin,or 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is alsoimportant that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seemslike you get everything several days after anyone else, or that youhave trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity isprobably not good enough.Listserv:There is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, whichis available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details ofthe installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of thisarticle, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list shouldprobably  look at listserv carefully.The Alias file:On a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases onwhichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as:foo:   bar, baz, bletchwhich means that any email sent the name `foo' on that host isredistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplestpossible email list is my-favorite-car:  member1, member2, member3, my-addressmy-favorite-car-request: my-addressthis has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being thatyou have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you cando the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin:my-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-listmy-favorite-car-request: my-addressWhere the file specified is a list of comma and newline separatedaddresses.  This file can be in the list admin's home directory,owned by the list admin.Bounced Mail:this still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all themembers of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating.Therefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set upis instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup,by the way.  I'm not sure where he got it from.)school-request:   weltyschool-rebroadcast:  :include:/home/newwelty/misc/autos/school/listschool: "|/usr/local/adm/bin/explscript school"owner-school: school-requestowner-school-out: school-requesthere's what is going on here:the owner- and -request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mailcoming from the network.  the -request address also serves as the pointof contact for administrative duties.school is what people send mail to; instead of pointing at addresses,it points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resendingthe email.  school-broadcast (of which nobody except me knows the name;the name has been changed here to protect my own sanity) points at theactual list members.the shell script i use is as follows:-----------------#!/bin/shcd /tmpsed -e '/^Reply-To:/d' -e '/^Sender:/d' -e '/^From /d' | \\        (echo Reply-To: ${1}@balltown.cma.com; \\         echo Errors-To: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\         echo Sender: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \\         cat -) | \\        /usr/lib/sendmail -om -f ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com \\                -F "The ${1} Mailing List" ${1}-rebroadcastexit 0-------------------note that this script does not know the name of the list; the nameis passed in from outside, so that the script may be used for multiplelists (i run several out of this site.)the script excises Reply-To:, Sender:, and From lines from the incomingmessage, substitutes for Sender: and Reply-To:, and adds Errors-to:99.9% of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the -requestor owner- addresses if this header rewrite is done.For digested lists, there is some digestification software around.Hopefully I'll be able to provide more information in a future versionof this posting.richard welty (welty@balltown.cma.com)-- richard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith

State Farm Insurance (this includes the additional $100for the $1,000,000 umbrella policy over my car and house)  The basepolicy is the standard $100,000 - $100,000 - $300,000 policy required in DE. After 2nd defensive driving course it will be 5% less. I bought the car in September 1992.  The company I was with (never hadand accident or ticket in 11 years) quoted me $2,500. Hope this helps. Steve FlynnUniversity of Delaware======================================================================== 45     Kevin:     (Hope I remembered your name correctly)...     You asked about insurance for performance cars.  Well, last year    I was in a similar situation before I bought my car, and made the    same inquiry as you.     Age: 24 (then and now)    Car: 1992 Eagle Talon TSi AWD    Driving Record: Clean    State: Illinois    Cost: $820/6 mos.     I turn 25 in May and the insurance goes down to $520/6 mos.    Also, I'm single and that incurs a higher rate with my company.     I've got a couple other friends w/ AWDs and they pay more    than I do (different ins. companies also), so maybe I'm just lucky.     Hope the info helps.

You take away all he hasand all he's ever gonna have."--Will Munny, "Unforgiven"======================================================================== 61 I am beyond the "under 25" age group, but I have an experience a fewyears ago that might be interesting to you.  I owned a 1985 Toyota CelicaGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runnersincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).I narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was lessmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxurycar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.I was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but idecided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I askedabout what would happen to my rate with either car. "If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same asthe Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for thatyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase becausethe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continueto handle your account. "If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go witha 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year,but cancel you after that." "But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actuallyfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense."  That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  Forsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -as very traditional and conservative." I eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porschedealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressureguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have takena year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  Iconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of autotheft.    /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\| |\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone's entitled to MY opinion.  / | |/ ||\\|\\  \\_|\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======     ======================================================================== 32 I live in Idaho.

Did you try calling all the insurance dealers you could find?Although rates are supposed to be standardized, I've found thatmost places I initially call, give me some ridiculously highquote and *finaly*, I hit one that is much lower. Also, I have changed insurance companies when the rate went up atrenewal (no accidents, tickets, car gets older??) to maintain a lowrate.

Diesel is the fuel of choice for enviromental benefit in Europe while here it's illegal for the same reason.The particulates are nothing but carbon.

My 1975 Saab 99didn't have them, but a friend's 1978 Saab 99 certainly did.  In additionto the confentional tail-light mounted backup lights, they had anotherset integrated into the front turn signal assembly.  For those of you whodon't remember, Saabs of that vintage had an enormous multicoloured plasticgrowth, about the size of a _National Geographic_ magazine, sticking outof the front fender, which incorporated amber "parking lights", amber sidemarker lights/reflectors, white "cornering lamps" (like American luxurycars) aimed towards the side of the road when you have your turn indicatorson, and white "backup lights" aimed towards the back of the car when youhave selected reverse gear.  The glossy brochure showed how these frontmounted backup lights were useful for illuminating hazards (pot holes, kid'stoys, etc) that would be run over by the front of the car if you had thewheels turned while backing up.Mart L.

It originallyhad a 1100 cc engine, which was later replaced by the 1900 cc.  It was basedon the old Kadett drive train and suspension, with leaf springs in the rearand a single transverse leaf spring in the front.  It looked good, but waslimited as a performer.There has also been some discussion in this thread about the Manta and othermodels.  In 1971 Opel introduced a new line of models, the 1900 series, thatwere also known as model numbers 51, 57, etc.  These cars had the newer1900cc engine and were available as two and four-door coupes, a station wagon,and a "sport coupe", known in Europe as the Manta.  At the same time, therewere two 30-series cars, which sold very few numbers, that also had the 1900engine but the Kadett suspension.  The sport coupe, (model 57) was alsoavailable as the Rallye, (57R), with a blacked out hood, tach, and fog lights,but was mechanically the same except for a numerically higher rear end ratio.In 1973 the sport coupe was also named the Manta in the US.  1973 was the lastyear for the GT in any country, both because of the US bumper height regulationsand the fact that FIAT exercised an option on the factory that Opel was leasingto build the GTs.The 1900 series continued in 1974 with minor body differences.  In 1975, theManta, 1900 sedan (also called the Ascona) and the wagon were available withBosch electronic fuel injection.  These cars also had larger brakes andwider wheels.  These cars were starting to compete with the 1975 Buick Centurylow price leader of the time, and were the last Opels imported into the US.From 1976 to 1979, cars that sported Buick/Opel badges were still sold bythe Buick dealers, but were rebadged Isuzu I-marks.  The idea was to call themOpels instead of changing the dealers' neon signs.Various models of the 50-series cars dominated the Showroom Stock racing of the70's in their class, and were known as serious 2002-competition.Parts are still available from a number of sources.(I still have a '73 manta and two '75 sedans and all the trick parts I couldcollect in 20 years).-- John Kennedy                     uunet!opel!johnkSecond Source, Inc.              johnk@secondsource.COM Annapolis, MD

For  crying out loud, how do these turkeys think they can talk to customers  this way and still stay in business? Again, I don't expect sales people to  bow, scrape, and grovel in my presence but I sure don't expect to be  abused either. I was very surprised by the way the sales people talked to  me and in other 'negotiating' sessions I overheard in neighboring sales  cubicles. Evidently, their success rate is high enough that they continue  to do business this way. There must be a lot of people out there who are  easy to intimidate.On the other hand, I'm not sure about the 'one price, no haggling'  approach that Saturn and other are starting to use. I guess if their fixed  price is fair it's OK. Maybe the best approach is to do your homework  before you go in. Find out the invoice prices of the car, add a reasonable  profit for the dealer ($200-$300??), offer them that price and stick to  it. If they get abusive, just leave.

I was quite happy with the way they handled...especially consideringthat I was expecting the worst from them!From what I've heard, it sounds like Ford/Mazda had some QC problems with the Probe (and probably MX-6) when they first went into production, but I think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point.

The keywords `Monthly Posting'will always appear to make killing this article easy for users ofnewsreaders with kill facilities.  This article is posted to all autosgroups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos.  If you don'tunderstand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or atleast for copies of the newuser documentation.  Failing that, pleasesubscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read thedocumentation provided there.Introduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy:rec.autos.techis intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design,construction, diagnosis, and service.  Other discussions are largelyinappropriate, especially For Sale ads.rec.autos.sportis intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involvingautomobiles.  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they applyto competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints,spectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars arelargely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads areinappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment.Discussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoidadvocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)rec.autos.drivingis intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles.Also, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insertyour pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.rec.autos.vwis intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownershipof automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis,Seats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailinglist was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existenceof this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover manydifferent marques; groups specific to individual marques should only becreated on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such asa mailing list.rec.audio.caris not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however,the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, andso is mentioned here.rec.autos.antiqueis intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 yearsold, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)alt.hotrodis not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to therec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailinglist, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developingperformance vehicles.alt.autos.rod-n-customalso not part of the `official' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiarAmerican hobby of customizing older cars.alt.autos.kartingfor the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.rec.autosis intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.Crossposting:Crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included onthe Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appearin all of the newsgroups listed.Crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities onUsenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article isappropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particularaudience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detectorarticles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They arealmost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the factthat you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics orrec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.Crossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usuallyinappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it istruly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To:to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.Crossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; inparticular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use ofradar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.Most readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn't care less aboutthe police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly inrec.autos.It is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines ofarticles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting tomisc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of thesethree.  The life you save may be your own.Distribution:There is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to(partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distributionfield.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serveas a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.The distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing, the Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia,New Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer thefollowing hints about use of the Distribution: field in your articleheaders, and on article content.1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out FordMavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone ineither place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strangereason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for whichyour car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differencesbetween a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise,all 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuelinjection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  Thesedifferences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear.Failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significantspread of misinformation.3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting;in the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereasEurope is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future editionof this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-usedabbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autosreaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, whenpossible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can(canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter stateabbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wantedto send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put"ny,nj" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separatedvalues are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, soyou should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likelyto be supported in your area.The Dangers of Overgeneralization:To amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article:Be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What istrue for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedlydifferent from those in Idaho.The Need for Adequate Specification:When you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information;e.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year,model, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may bequite useless.Concerning Lemons:At one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon ortwo; even Honda admits to this.  Please don't waste everyone's time byannouncing to the world that your `brand x' automobile is terrible, so all`brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car fromthe `brand x' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because theycause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no usefulinformation.Concerning Flames:As much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that mostlikely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and howto deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next sectionof this posting):If you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for aminute that including the words `No Flames' will work.  It won't, andyou'll get exactly what you deserve.If you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you cancite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believebald, unsupported assertions.Be careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.Asking the Question:It is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Pleasesend email, I don't read this group'.  It is a much better idea toend the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interestI'll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responsesto this request'.Answering the Question:If someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don't tell them to get a Mustang.Either be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice ondefending a speeding ticket, don't tell them to obey the law next time --it's offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn't directlyaddress the original question.  In general, don't post in order to seeyour words in print, and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug andself-righteous.Stale and/or Inflammatory Topics:Certain topics are considered stale by `old timers'; while discussion ofthem is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravingsabout them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts themignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it isdifficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Someof these topics include the following:1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of    radar detectors.3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why    rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car' group -- everyone would argue    about what constitutes a `sports car'.)5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver's    right to own and operate a radar detector6)  `Buy American' discussions7)  `clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?      [when I have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the          commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly.          Until then, please don't waste bandwidth on this topic. -- rpw]Please direct comments and suggestions about this article to:     welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com-- richard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith

"Dealer invoice" is *not* "dealer cost".You'll hear lots of ads screaming "two dollars over dealer invoice!!!"Sounds like a real deal, huh?  No.  You know what the "dealer invoice"(also called factory invoice) is?  It's a piece of paper with numberson it that the factory sends the dealer.  What do the numberssignify?  Absolutely nothing.  It's a marketing gimmick that thesalesman can wave in your face to impress you.  Note that nowhereon the "invoice" does it claim to be the real price of the car, andmost ads which mention dealer invoice will end with a very fast,low voice saying something like "invoice may not reflect actualdealer cost".  Actually, I *guarantee* it does not reflect actualdealer cost.Also, the reasonable profit for dealer is usually around three percent.Adjust according to the dealer cost of the car and any options thatyou want.  Haggle like hell with the salesman over the cost of"dealer prep" and "protection package" (i.e. a few squirts ofpaint and fabric protectant).  While you're at it, ask the salesmanto toss in a thing or two that doesn't cost him any cash.  My wife and I got a joyride in a twin-turbo Mitsubishi 3000GT whenwe bought our Mitsubishi mini-van.

But whetherthe military has much of anything that goes 80 on the road isanother matter.  A few of their most whomped-up diesel trucks,maybe, load permitting.  The military surplus stuff I'vedriven -- "Jeep Classic" (Willys/Kaiser/AMC, pre-independentsuspension) and Power Wagons (Slant 6 in a crew-cab pickup)weren't exactly congenial at highway speeds, and I wouldn'tswear any of them would do 80 except as a bedload on a semi.You just gotta love the standard military tire, too, or atleast the one they used to use.  Designed circa WW II as acompromise between traction in icky sticky goo and longevityon sharp rocks and so forth, it's quite ill-adapted to highspeeds on civilian roadways.  For those who can't rememberwhat they look like, imagine a mountain-bike tire with aroad rib in the middle, scaled up to car size. Oh, yeah, andnarrow too. One of the standard mods for civilizing a surplus Jeep was to install tires and wheels that reflected some ofthe advancements made in ride and handling since D-Day.But the point made by Wharfie and others still stands:  ifyou're going to do 80 in a mil-spec '58 Power Wagon (or aJeep or a tank transporter or other unwieldy rubber-tiredvehicle) anywhere, I'd suggest the American interstate.  Your safe speed there tends to be limited more by your carand skills, road maintenance, and the swarms of fools aroundyou; the roads were designed for going like the devil.Naturally, neither I nor my employer advocates unsafe orunlawful driving.--Joe"Just another personal opinion from the People's Republic of Berkeley"

You can adjustit to be sensitive enough that there is no way you could open the hood withoutsetting off the alarm.  Although, I know that you cannot pop the hood on theSyclone without setting off my alarm now, and yet I have had zero (none!) falsealarms with this system.  The alarm tells you when you disarm it whether it hasbeen activated in your absence.  I have been able to trace every alarm to it'scause and it was not a false alarm.> > I'm also wondering how easy it would be for a thief to crawl> underneath the car and cut the battery cable to disable the alarm.> I guess it would be possible depending on the vehicle.  My Syclone is so tightin the engine compartment that it would be tough to do this.  There aresupplemental power supplies you can put on with this Viper alarm, but I don'thave one.  I really think that if someone wants my car that bad, the alarmwon't keep them from it, even with a supplemental power supply.> Viper also sells some fancy field disturbance sensor that> supposedly detects people approcahing the car....> This is primarily for convertibles.  I have a convertible and have looked atthis feature in detail.  Alpine actually makes a better radar unit if you wantto get one of these.  It has zones in it that can be shut down independently sothat if one side of your car has pedestrian traffic or something else thatwould trigger an alarm, it shuts down the zone, or rather, pulls it in tighter.I don't see the real benefit to these unless you have a convertible that youleave the top down on.Avoid the voice alarm that can be added to the radar package.  It talks topeople as they walk by.  I saw one installed on a Lotus Esprit.  The kids wouldtaunt it seeing how close they could get before it 'warned' them to get back. The owner finally disabled it, which defeats the purpose in my mind.> > I'm interested in the opinions of you netters about these problems> and about the viper in general.> I am real happy with my Viper.  One other feature I really like is you can tuneit to your preferences.  You can have it arm passively or not.  You can disablethe chirp for arming/disarming.  You can have it lock/unlock the doors when thealarm is armed/disarmed.  I like these features.  I hate the chirp when the alarm arms/disarms, so mineflashes the lights only.  I like the door lock feature, although I have to becareful to take my keys with me because it doesn't know if you have left yourkeys in the car when it passively arms and locks the doors.

It is a real nice system, butmore money and it has a motion sensor standard instead of the shock sensor. The shock sensor is better....and the Viper shock sensor is better (2 cycle)than the optional Alpine one, IMHO.  I think the Viper gives you a lot of goodvalue for the money.  But it isn't absolutely tamperproof.  No system is. Except maybe the one that James Bond had on his Lotus in For Your Eyes Only. Anyone know where we can get one of those installed?

In both cases I was stopped and had no place to go (and I saw itcoming both times). >Even in high-speed head-on collisions the most beneficial item you can>have is a good old 3-point seatbelt.

That's something I certainly look>for and which can be had in inexpensive cars.If you _really_ want to add safety to _any_ car, simply add a cage to thecar.  They are available and cheap (about $500 in the USA).  Add to thatfour or five or six point belts and you will walk away from collisions thatwere otherwise not survivable.  but instead of people spending a littleextra money, we get legislation that says the gov't must mandate a minimallevel of protection for everyone. One other significant factor in improving one's own safety is to get sometraining.  This will improve your safety more than any other singleinvestment will.  Drive/ride defensively (and that does not mean you haveto be a doddering old stick in the mud).  People here tend to enthuse aboutautos more than the average (probably in the top 15th percentile in drivingability), but still we sometimes overlook the obvious.  I've been to twodriving schools, and three riding schools for my motorcycle.  A veryworthwhile investment (and besides, it was a lot of fun too ;-). Safety is what you make of it, just because a carmaker doesn't provide youwith an adequate level of protection doesn't mean you have to leave it go atthat. -- Al Bowers  DOD #900  Alfa  Ducati  Hobie  Kottke  'blad  Iaido  NASA"Well goodness sakes...don't you know that girls can't play guitar?"                                             -Mary Chapin-Carpenter

The computer will actually "sense" how you drive your car and  as time goes by the green indicators will start to go off one by one and  then the yellow indicator will turn on and then the red indicator will go  on. And you should get service when by the time green indicators are off.    After service the mechanic(or you) will reset the service indicators and the  computer starts counting again.So I expect to have a tool(or a procedure) to reset it so the green lights will come on and the yellow and red lights will go off.I wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how to reset theindicator.It's the first european car I have and changing oil at 15,000 miles is a surprise to me. and it's a big plus :-). But I wonder how that could happensince the oil lose its lubrication ability over time, I thought it's the oil andnot the vehicle that determines how often we should change oil.Any BMW owner on the net? Response welcomed.PS.  my initial question is "how do you seset the service indicator of a BMW"Derek

I believe that automaticsshould only be manufactured for people with physical disabilities who otherwisewould not be able to drive.  Automatic transmissions allow drivers to be lazy.More time is available to fiddle with the radio or to look at the sceneryinstead of concentrating on the road.  The manual transmission keeps the drivealways doing something, granted it isn't a large movement.  Plus, driving shouldbe FUN!  Driving a manual is fun, driving an automatic is a chore.In the case of shift speed, automatics can be made to shift far fasterthat any human could move a stick.  If I was racing, I'd want and automatic.  Fornormal driving go with the manual.

"hoeger" isSwedish and stands for 'right') practically all cars already had theirsteering wheels on the left side. Even the imported cars from UK hadthe wheel on 'the right side'. At last we have cars with the wheels onthe right side. :-)More contries that uses the left side is:JapanTanzania (I think)New ZeelandHow about South Africa?BTW.

I believedthis and to put it nicely, it was a piece of junk!I loved this car, I babied it, I pampered it, and after 2 years, it justcouldn't stay together, I would say that not everyone will have theproblems that I had, but know this, it's not just the car, it is theability to get the car fixed, which will NOT happen at anychrysler/dodge/take your pick dealer.  I don't care if there are going toreform their dealers/service with the intro of the LH cars, I will believeit when I see it.  Case and point, the local dodge dealer.  You drive up,just looking, you don't even get out of your door, when about 10 (yes 10)salesman all eye you like their next meal, and literally pounce on you,and try to get you to make a deal, on everything your eye wanders towards.Service is about 2 times worse than that.  I had an alignment problem, butthey tried to tell me that the K frame was bent, and about 2000 dollars ofwork/parts to fix it.  Let me tell you the problems I had, and I took careof this car, I put alot of miles on it in the first couple years, but tookit to every checkup it needed, and many that shouldn't have been.1988 Dodge Shadow ESThese were replaced within the 4 years that I owned the car.Engine 4 AlternatorsRear Suspension Torsion Bar2 Water pumps5 thermostatsHall effect sensorMain computer4 BatteriesThese were rebuilt/repairedRadiatorAutomatic TransmissionPower SteeringThose are just the things I can remember off the top of my head.  Forabout a year before I sold the car, I said to myself, it's a good car, Ijust can't find anybody competent enough the fix it.  In the end, before Itraded it in for a Saturn, the power steering started acting up again.  Ijust stopped putting money into it.  I must have put at least $5000-$7000worth of repairs over it's lifetime.  I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can biteme.  Bullshit, whoever backs em best, is just afraid the stupid things aregoing to fall apart, and no one will buy them without assurance, why thehell do you think that LH has been nicknamed Last Hope.You can do better, and I know people will disagree with me here, butJapanese, like Honda, or Toyota, or the only american car company that Ifeel is a quality product, Saturn.  I will not touch another chryslerproduct again, no way.  I don't care how good the LH cars look good, and Iwill admit they look promising, but not with the support that you get.  GMisn't much better, thank god, they don't control Saturn, like they dotheir divisions, or it would be just another marketing ploy.  Don't get me wrong, i will be watching my car (which I do like) like ahawk for the next 4 years.  I am much more hesitant to say it (or any) caris really good, until it has proved itself to me.But since someone else pointed out C&D as a source.  I will note, becauseI used to read these magazines, that Car and Driver has never had a goodthing to say about most Chrysler products (Shadow for one), always werethey moaning about the reguritated K-car, and engine.  Whereas Motor Trendalways thought they were great cars.  No car magazine is really objective.And although there are alot of people who don't like Consumers Reports, Iwill use them to reinforce my argument (I already know about the big stinkwith the Saturn crash tests, time will tell how good a car they are), theshadow/sundance rate much worse than average, in fact none of thechrysler's rate a better than average, I think the best one is justaverage.  Excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the LH's.  Youcan find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might, when I researchedthe Saturn, I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great dealof information about this company, just because it is a new americancompany and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, forgood reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines ofany established company.  I read an article, which had a sub-column, an Ithink this imprinted on me more than anything else.  Some big wig inToyota said and I quote, "We are watching them very closely."  Come on,everybody grow up, the foreign cars, especially the japanese have beenkicking our butts, for good reason, the american car companies could not makea good product or support the customer the way they want these days, toset in their ways, which is one of the reasons Saturn was created.  Theyare still struggling because they haven't learned yet.  They have theability, the workers are not inferior, the technology is not out of date,but their attitude is, and they are just finding this out.  It's calledcompetition gentleman/women if you don't satisfy the demand of theconsumer, well your out..  *asbestos suit on*Gaia

But in case there aresome misconceptions, I think Henry Robertson hasn't updated his datafile on Korea since...mid 1970s.  Owning a car in Korea is no longera luxury.  Most middle class people in Korea can afford a car and dohave at least one car.  The problem in Korea, especially in Seoul, isthat there are just so many privately-owned cars, as well as taxis andbuses, the rush-hour has become a 24 hour phenomenon and that there isno place to park.  Last time I heard, back in January, the Kim Administrationwanted to legislate a law requireing a potential car owner to providehis or her own parking area, just like they do in Japan.Also, Henry would be glad to know that Hyundai isn't the onlycar manufacturer in Korea.  Daewoo has always manufactured cars andI believe Kia is back in business as well.  Imported cars, such asMercury Sable are becoming quite popular as well, though they are stillquite expensive.Finally, please ignore Henry's posting about Korean politicsand bureaucracy.  He's quite uninformed.-- T. H.

I've beendoing it my self over 200,000 miles, on my current toyota truck I've gotover 150k. I've heard people talk about how doing this can damage atransmission. My experiences suggest otherwise. What techniques do you use?On some old pieces of junk I drove, the transmission was soworn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift, except clutchless.To date I've driven rabbits, datsuns, comets, fords & a chevy. Some whereharder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smootherquicker & easier they where to shift.My technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gentlywrist back on the shift lever. If for some reason I miss the shift window,I lightly press the accelerator & try agian. I've found that clutchlessshifting is eaiser/quicker at high rpms (4000-7000). I also skip gears sometimes using 1-3-5 ,1-2-4-5. krispy

When the brakes are applied, there results uneven pressureon the rotor.  Turning the rotors by a brake shop will remedy this problemas long as there is enough rotor width left for turning (i.e. within spec).There could be some possible front end suspension problem but a brake shopshould be able to confirm warped rotors by a visual inspection which is free.

On the passenger side, I had to wrestle the wheel into rollingforward about 1/2 inch to get things to line up.

'89s go for about $15K, '90s go for perhaps 1or 2K more, the 20 valve 91's are quite a bit more because of anenormous hp and torque gain.. i think they go for about $23 to $25K ifyou can find one.  i have seen quite a lot of '89-'90 200 quattros (notthat many wagons though) at the dealer lot.. they use very highquality paint and the entire car is zinc galvanized, so it will neverrust.in short, typically a 4 yr old 200 looks no more older than a 1 yearold and the 5 bangers are bullet proof engines.  200K out of one isnot rare, even for a turbo, which is watercooled for the 200s.  thenthere are aftermarket chips that you can buy to bump up turbo boost...if you are into luxo-gizmos.. the cars are loaded with just abouteverything too..the price of parts is a different story though...eliot

The problem is that the car has aftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is ratherweak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.The inspection garage said that they won't pass it unless I get awaiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - theofficer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get awaiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him toshow me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal.  Heshowed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, ifyou can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I toldhim that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the bookand said "It's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give youa ticket for it right now." Well, won't argue with that...Since the vehicle code says it's OK as long as you can see through thetint, I'd like to keep it (I'll re-read the vehicle code in thelibrary).  I'd also like to get some sort of paper from the policethat says it's OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won'tget in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn't mind registeringa complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.So does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper fromthe police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experienceregistering a complaint against an officer? I called the station later on today, but they basically said there is no place where Icould register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decideto keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance doI stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?Any comments about it will be welcome!Michal

I called> my mechanic and he told me I need a new brake master cylinder,> which will cost me a whopping $250-300.You are not alone.  My '79 Honda Accord with 110,000 miles on it started  showing the same behavior.I replaced the brake master cylinder myself.  It took about an hour and cost  about $45.  Sure beats paying $300 to have someone else do it!  If I wanted to  rebuild my own master cylinder instead of putting in a rebuilt one, it would  have cost only $20 to $30 for the rebuild kit.The Honda brake master cylinder is easy to get to.  Two bolts attach it to the  engine compartment.  Two brake lines enter the master cylinder.  The tricky  part was that the brake lines were stuck tight.  My Craftsmen open end wrench  rounded off the bolt heads!  I had to use Vise Grips to loosen those suckers.   Wow!  Best invention since sliced bread.  After that it was very easy.  Bolt  the new part in place, add new brake fluid, and bleed the brakes.This is quite easy even for a beginner.  My local auto parts store had a repair  manual for the Honda Accord; it had detailed diagrams of the master brake  cylinder and a step-by-step procedure for replacing it.

(i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in thelow gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners andwould like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there'sanother curve approaching)3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal isdepressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modernelectronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light aboutto turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on aslittle as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.also, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileagethan a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember thatthe idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes abig assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear touse for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with aninattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a5 speed)?  how many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the bestgear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i'm sure there willbe some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic withall possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to dobetter.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were provedwrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear,low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, highrevs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple ifone sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight.eliot

I have recently purchased (withinthe last 8 months) the BEL 966STW.  While it is not a perfectdetector by any means, it does do the job fairly well.  Now, however, I pick up a car magazine at the airport andread about this Super Ka Wideband which is a superset ofthe Ka Wideband that this latest generation of detectorswas touted as covering.  So now BEL has a NEW series of detectors out that cover allthe usual bands (X, K, Ka photo, Ka wideband) as well as thenew Super Ka wideband.  Just as there comes a point of diminishing returns when chasingincreased PC computing power with faster and faster CPUs (forthe average home consumer, at least), it seems that there isnow the same concern with radar detectors.  Does it make senseto upgrade just 8 months after purchasing my "new" detector?Is Valentine upgrading their equipment?  If so, it might be worth it for me to upgrade to the Valentine.  I was in the market for a Valentine when I purchased the BEL but the3-4 month waiting time was just too much for me since I hadinadequate protection with my Passport.  Life was much simplerwhen there was just X and K band and Escort has the bestequipment on the market and there was no need to continuouslyshop for a new detector.  I hope that the flood of new radar bands ceases with this new Super Wideband business.>>                                  \\|/>                                #######>                              / ~     ~ \\>                              |[0]---[0] |>   ===============================| |===================================>  _|___                           |_|                ___|_> (_____) Allen Tobias           Technical    email:                (_____)> (_____) Convex Computer Corp.

Those on my Taurus Wagon are quite brightenough to illuminate a good area behind the car, and they're MUCH brighter than those on my earlier cars from the 60s and 70s. Insofar as Vettes having side backup lights, look at a '92 or '93model (or perhaps a year or two earlier too) and you'll seered side marker lamps and white side marker lamps both near thecar's hindquarters.

The Cd is related to the drag force which is what effects top speed andfuel consumption. When the drag force on the car or aircraft is greaterthan what the vehicle's engine can overcome it has reached its top speed.(autos of course also have to overcome rolling resistance)Since drag opposes the vehicle's motion, the engine must make up for thatby burning more fuel. Anyway, since the geometery of an auto is rathercomplex, the Drag,pressure coeffiecent,etc is either found experimentaly, orusing a numerical method.anyway for flow around a cylinder the drag coeff is:            Cd = d/(q*2R)       where d is the drag force, q the flow velocity and R is the radiusof the clyinder.   To get a rough (very rough) estimate, you can set R at 1/2 the car'swidth, q at the car's speed and knowing the Cd, find the drag force thatthe car would need to overcome.      -Bp

You guys must all think I'mnuts, right?  Well, I did a little research into Ka usage in thisarea and found out that Ka is not currently being used in this stateas well as surrounding states.  Here's how I found out:- A cop friend who did spend time nailing speeders doesn't even know   what Ka is.  He's heard of K, which is what they use here and I  explained that Ka is used for photo radar etc.. He then said, yeah,  "Ka stands for K automatic"... duuhh.  He then went on to say that  plans were being made for getting laser guns as far as going high  tech were concerned, but he didn't know too much.- My 8 year old 2 band whistler was consistently going off at speed traps,  even the real sneaky ones.- When I called the Escort Shop, they confirmed that Ka is not used here  or in surrounding states.  They did claim that Laser was being used  a lot here, which I was quite skeptical of.So in the end, instead of spending a lot of money and/or waitingmonths for a state of the art detector, I got a low priced, highperformance 2 band Escort 2200.  Incidentally its performance is equalto their top of the line model in X and K band detection.  I know thatEscort has been surpassed by other brands lately, but I've never fullyrelied on a detector and I was convinced that the Escorts would be atleast quite good, which was good enough for me and my wallet.eliot

I'd like to give some feedback based onreal life experince.  I keep the Valentine-1 in advanced logic modeand it rarely lights up as a Christmas tree.  The only time it doesis when I am in the middle of a major shopping area and then it makessense that is does since there are >= 8 sources coming from many differentdirections.  I have found the Valentine-1 to be consistent in itsreporting of bogeys regardless of any moving cars in the area.I have found the directional indication to be very useful.  In one casethere was two radar traps set up within one mile of each other.  As Ipassed the first radar trap, the direction indication changed.  Thenthe detector was set off again pointing in the forward direction.  Withother radar detectors I would have assumed that this was due to a reflection.But with the Valentine-1 I knew there was a high probability that therewas another trap.  And there was!On other occasions, the directional helped discern a false alarm froma true alarm.  For example, as I pass a source, the direction indicatorchanges.  The directional also allows me to focus my attention as to wherethe signal might be coming from instead of having to look all over the place.  When a car is approaching me from the rear with a detectorthat leaks, I can tell that the signal is coming from the rear and as thecar passes me I can verify the source.  With other detectors, I wouldhave been unable to do this and would have had to assume that there was a radartrap when there was none.I've had the Valentine-1 for several months now and find its added featuresto be useful and not gimmicks.                                       -Barry-- -----                                                                   --------Barry Frishberg                                             blf@apollo.ch.hp.comChelmsford-UK Expert Center                                      508/TN 436-4319Chelmsford, MA

Theolder models are VERY well built. Unless Toyota lost its mind, I wouldassume, until  proven otherwise, that the newer models have inherited someif not all of the qualities of their ancestors.Two major differences in the running gear (that I'm aware of) need study.My '79 has a solid front axle housing whereas the newer models haveindependant front suspension. The solid axle is theoretically stronger andmore reliable than the newer model, but only experience will tell. Theindependant front suspension is, no doubt, a compromise made to satisfythe typical user, who will never need a real utility vehicle. The seconddifference is the type of transfer case used on the newer models. I'mnot sure, but I think Tioyota went to a full-time 4WD or all-wheel drivesystem. The older Landcruisers have a "lock-up" type. Both have theiradvantages and disadvantages.Paul Hovnanianhovnania@atc.boeing.com[Std disclaimers apply]

While I never intentionally slamed my '68 Firebird 400 ci Conv. into gear, I would leave the trannie in Low (read 1st), grab hold, hit the pedal, and once the tires grabbed, take off.  When I reached about 57-60mph the turbo 400 Auto would shift to S (read 'super' or 2nd) and leave about 10 to 15 foot of double stripped rubber on the ground.  Most everyone I knew at the time was quite impressed with 'peeling' out at 60 MPH.  The trannie held up just fine.Motor mounts would last about a year until I tied the motor down with largechains.
