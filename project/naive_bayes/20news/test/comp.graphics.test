And is it as easy touseas 3D Studio? Can it just do a render as fast as 3DS if you don't wantthings like IOR etc.. 3DS can do fine shadows, animated reflection maps,animated bump maps, animated anything maps, and with the IPAS routines (Not that I've ever seen them) It can do explosions, top qualitymorphing, fire, rain, lens flares etc..I'm not knocking imagine, I just want to know how it compares with 3DS

I'd be very interested to get my hands on one of these,especially considering the fact that Motorola has not yet released the68060, which is supposedly the next in the 680x0 lineup. 8-DRicardo, the animation playback to which Lawrence was referring in anearlier post is plain old Quicktime 1.5 with the Compact Video codec.I've seen digitized video (some of Apple's early commercials, to beprecise) running on a Centris 650 at about 30fps very nicely (16-bitcolor depth). I would expect that using the same algorithm, a RISCprocessor should be able to approach full-screen full-motion animation,though as you've implied, the processor will be taxed more with highlydynamic material.========================================================================Sean McMains              | Check out the Gopher    | Phone:817.565.2039University of North Texas | New Bands Info server   | Fax  :817.565.4060P.O.

For any information, contact (matjaz.gams@ijs.si). Dear Colleague,                                        April 25, 1993Number 1 of volume 17 of Informatica is now out of print and some of you will receive it in a week or so. As you will see, the journal is structuredin the following way: the editorial (first page); profiles (second page-- biography of an editor, in this issue, Terry Winograd); the editedpart of papers (pp. 3-80); mission and research reports (A plan forknowledge archives project in Japan and CSLI in Stanford, pp. 81-100);and news and announcements (pp. 101-108). This structure is mentioned togive you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of thejournal significant, diverse, and interesting, bringing your own viewsinto the discourse.   A great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page. This pageexpresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problemswithin the scope of computing and informatics, extending into otherconcerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced AI, cognitive sciences,mind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology (e.g. photonics), etc. I asked professor Terry Winograd to write thispage for Number 2. I certainly would appreciate very much to getsuggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to expresstheir strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of thearea in question.   On the second page of each Number an editor's profile is published.The aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional achievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation onone side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in whicheditors has lived and live on the other side. This kind of story shouldbe instructive, adequately factically faced, contributing to the understanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live.   The edited part (edited papers) is still critical. I would like to havea stock of accepted papers in advance, so the issuing dates of a particularnumber can be fixed (e.g. January, April, July, and October). In situationright now, I ask you to help me with contributions of yours or yourcolleagues, collaborators, students, etc. Some critical views to thecontemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated.A special emphasis should be given also to originality by which freshideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities.   Reports of different occasions (symposia, conferences, meetings, etc.)and particularly on new books, papers, and interesting events are welcome.You can send these news immediately (also by your secretary) by e-mail.On the other hand, you can send books and other publications (annualreports, journals, calls for papers, etc.) for reviewing and publishingin Informatica. We in the editorial staff will manage the rest.   E-mail is functioning satisfactorily, so please use it in every respect.You can submit editorial notes, profiles, reports, news and even completepapers written in standard LaTex format (especially formulas). We receivedseveral final (corrected) texts in Number 1 from different sites (US,Russia, etc.). In this way, you can compose reports from already typedtexts, using your own choice and editing, and submit them to the contactperson (matjaz.gams@ijs.si), who is always being on your disposal. So,you will receive a prompt confirmation and any information concerningour common interest and job.At the end, please do not forget: we need your cooperation and help inevery mentioned respect. The aim of Informatica is to open variouspossibilities of communication concerning strong scientific and philosophical orientations as well as those coming up, still unrevealed,and on the way to become significant. Please, do not apprehend to giveproposals, suggestions, and, certainly, contributions via the e-mailand by other means.Sincerely yours,Anton P. "ZeleznikarEditor-in-chief

The first one is Ray (or half line) method. Inthis method, you can draw any ray, if the number of the intersection pointof the ray and the polygon is even, then it is outside. If the number is odd,then it is inside. Of cause, you have to deal with the special cases whichmay make you headache.The second method is PI algorithm. Draw the lines between the point andall the vertices on the polygon. Calculate and sum the angles of thesuccessive lines. If the result is 2*PI, then it is inside. If PI, thenit is on the polygon. Otherwise it is outside.My experience tells the second method is relible.Hope this helps.YehUSC

They're intended more as anintro to mode 13h programming, a starting point.*** The library assumes a 386 processor, but it is trivial to modify it*** for a 286.  If enough people ask, I'll make the mods and re-post it as a*** different version.The routines are written in assembly (TASM) and are callable from C.  Theyare fairly simple, but I've found them to be very fast (for my purposes,anyway).  Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h, define a"virtual screen", put and get pixels, put a pixmap (rectangular image withno transparent spots), put a sprite (image with see-thru areas), copyareas of the virtual screen into video memory, etc.  I've also included asimple C routine to draw a line, as well as a C routine to load a 256color GIF image into a buffer.  I also wrote a quick'n'dirty(tm) demo programthat bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three "windows".The whole package is available on spang.camosun.bc.ca in /pub/dos/vgl.zip It is zipped with pkzip 2.04gIt is completely in the public domain, as far as I'm concerned.  Do withit whatever you like.  However, it'd be nice to get credit where it's due,and maybe an e-mail telling me you like it (if you don't like it don't bother)Markmorley@camosun.bc.ca

I would prefer a method that would do this in as little>  time as possible.  I need this for use in a forward raytracing>  program.I think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines andpolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number ofpoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.First, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, theJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane intoexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line liescompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.Now, the phrasing of this question says "if a line intersects a polygon", sothis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) isto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try tosolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.In recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in anew language called PostScript.  (See "PostScript Language", by Adobe SystemsIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).So, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program thatdraws the line L and the polygon P, and then "outputs" the answer.  By"output", we mean the program executes a command called "showpage", whichactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quickexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thusthe original problem.There are two small problems with this approach. (1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into thereduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom ofChoice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom ofChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not thePostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or inother words, will it halt?Now, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that aTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) isundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turnout to be undecidable.I won't even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finiteprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.A couple of references might be:1.

Dickens, C.--------From: td@alice.UUCP (Tom Duff)Summary: Overkill.Organization: AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill NJThe situation is not nearly as bleak as Baraff suggests (he should knowbetter, he's hung around The Labs for long enough).  By the well knownDobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc.37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced toHamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin anacronym) is probably only NP-complete.

Any three of them must benon-collinear (otherwise all three could not lie on the surfaceof a sphere) and all four must not be coplaner (otherwise eitherthey cannot all lie on a sphere or they define an infinity of them).A, B and C define a circle. The perpendicular bisectors of AB, BCand CA  meet in a point (P, say) which is the centre of this circle.This circle must lie on the surface of the desired sphere.Consider the normal to the plane ABC passing through P. All pointson this normal are equidistant from A, B and C and its circle (infact it is a diameter of the desired sphere). Take the planecontaining this normal and D (if D lies on the normal anyplane containing the normal will do); this plane is at right anglesto the ABC one.Let E be the point (there are normally two of them) on the circumferenceof the ABC circle which lies in this plane. We need a point Q on thenormal such that EQ = DQ. But the intersection of the perpendicularbisector of ED and the normal is such a point (and it exists since D isnot in the plane ABC, and so ED is not at right angles to the normal).Algorithm:Is the sphere well defined?    (1) Check that A and B are not coincident (=> failure).    (2) Find the line AB and check that C does not lie on it (=> failure).    (3) Find the plane ABC and check that D does not lie in it (=> failure).Yes. Find its centre.    (1) Find the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC.    (2) Find their point of intersection (P).    (3) Find the normal to the plane ABC passing through P (line N).    (4) Find the plane containing N and D; find the point E on theABC circle in this plane (if D lies on N, take E as A).    (4) Find the perpendicular bisector of ED (line L)    (5) Find the point of intersection of N and L (Q).Q is the centre of the desired spherePictures:(1) In the plane ABCA                                P                                 B                               C(2) At right-angles to ABC, in the plane containing N and DE                                                          D    line N    --------------------P-------------Q---------------------------Numerically:If ED << EP then Q will be very close to P (relative to the radiusof the ABC circle) and subject to error.

We are going to show a video-tape with some of our results, so any good data that we will receive will be presented in the tape, with a mention of the donator.We are working on databases consisting of aerial or satelite photographs, and terrain elevation maps (DTM). Each database consists of a 2D array of height values (any data format canbe used for each value), and a corresponding 2D array of color values (canbe gray-level, 256-color value or full 24-bit R/G/B values. Other format canalso be used). We work on 512X512 and 1024x1024 resolution databases.If anybody has access to this kind of data, or knows where we can get suchdata files, please respond in this news group, or - better - email usdirectly :amit@math.tau.ac.il    (Amit Shaked), ordanny@indigo.bgu.ac.il (Daniel Cohen)Of course, the names of the people who will help us get the data will becited in our paper, and in further publications.

Traditionally, they have used pictures, words, demonstrations,    music and dance to communicate imagery.  However, expressing    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far    exceed their technical skills.    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression    tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the    observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar    representions, a confounded user asks: "What does it all mean?"    Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and    ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by    physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media    radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic    communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for    composing imagery for understanding.    Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a    breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the    physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,    psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and    discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the    computer graphics context.

How VESA standard works?  Any documentation for VESA standard?2. At a higher resolution than 320x200x256 or 640x480x16 VGA mode,   where the video memory A0000-AFFFF is no longer sufficient to hold   all info, what is the trick to do fast image manipulation?  I   heard about memory mapping or video memory bank switching but know   nothing on how it is implemented.   Any advice, anyone?  3. My interest is in 640x480x256 mode.  Should this mode be called   SVGA mode?  What is the technique for fast image scrolling for the   above mode?  How to deal with different SVGA cards?  Your guidance to books or any other sources to the above questionswould be greatly appreciated.  Please send me mail.

However,the calculations are mathematically highly complex, and must assume that theobject's hole projects an image (resembling an ellipse if the tube is notparallel to the screen) in the centre of the screen.  However, it is unlikelythat the object is placed so conveniently.  Firstly, we must transform the major and minor axis of the ellipse.  I cannotknow what the angle between the tube and screen is.  Do I have to assume thatthey are parallel to do the transformation?  How do I do this transformation?Secondly, there is a distortion of the image due to the screen being planar(the source--screen distance increases as we move away from the centre of thescreen).  How can I compensate the ellipse's axis for this image distortion?So, please can anyone give us a few pointers here?  How do we transform theimage so it appears as it would if it were in the centre of the screen, and howdo I deal with distortion due to the shape of the screen?We'd appreciate any help, either posted or emailed.Thanks in advance, Simon.-- Simon Marshall, Dept. of Computer Science, University of Hull, Hull HU6 7RX, UK  "Football isn't about life and death.

SOFTWARE            For support VIDEOSCAN family program kit was developed. Kit       includes more then 200 different functions for image processing.            Kit works in the interactive regime, and has include Help for       non professional users.            There are next possibility:       - input frame by any board of VIDEOSCAN family;       - read - white image to - from disk;       - print image on the printer;       - makes arithmetic with 2 frames;       - filter image;       - work with gistogramme;       - edit image.       - include users exe modules.                     CONTROLLER VS9       The function of VS-9 controller is to load TV-images into  PC/AT.       VS-9 controller allows one to load a fragment of the TV-frame from       a field of 724x600 pixels.       The clock rate is 14,7 MHz when loading an image with 512 pixel in       the line and 7,4 MHz when loading a 256 pixels image. This       provides the equal pixel size of input image in both horizontal       and vertical directions.       The number of gray levels in any input modes is 256.       Video signal capture time - 2.5s.                     CONTROLLER VS52       The purpose of the controller is to enter the TV images into a IBM       PC AT or any other machine of that type. The controller was       created on the base of modern elements, including user       programmable gate arrays.       The controller allows to digitize a input signal with different       resolutions. Its flexible architecture makes possible to change       technical parameters. Instead of TV signal one can process any       other analog signal (including signals from slow-speed scanning       devices).       The controller has the following technical characteristics:       - memory volume - from 256 K to 2 Mb ;       - resolution when working with standard video signal - from 64x64       to 1024x512 pixels ;       - resolution when working in slow input regime - up to 2048x1024       pixels;       - video signal capture time - 40 ms.       - maximum size of a screen when memory volume is 2Mb - 2048x1024       pixels ;       - number of gray level - 256 ;       - clock rate for input - up to 30 MHz ;       - 4 input video multiplexer ;       - input/output lookup table (LUT);       - possibility to realize "scroll" and "zoom";       - 8 lines for external synchronization (an input using external       controlling signal) ;       - electronic adjustment of black and white reference for analog -       digital converter;       - possibility output image to the color RGB monitor.       One can change all listed above functions and parameters of the       controller by reprogramming it.              IMAGE PROCESSOR VS100            Image processor VS100 allows to digitize and process TV       signal in real time. It is possible digitize TV signal with       512*512*8 resolution and realize arithmetic and logic operation       with two images.            Processor was created on the base of modern elements       including user programmable gate arrays and designed as a board       for PC.            Memory volume allows write to the 256 frames with 512*512*8       format. It is possible to accumulate until 16 images.            The processor has the following technical characteristics:       - memory volume to 64 Mb;       - number of the gray level - 256;       - 4 input video multiplexer;       - input/output lookup table;       - electronic adjustment for black and white ADC reference;       - image size from 256*256 to 8192*8192;       - possibility color and black / white output;       - possibility input from slow-scan video sources.

Of course the chances ofOk It is for a game that is 3d and you have listed the characteristics that you are looking for. I think you may have left out a few important parameters. The polygons are all convex. They have less than N sides. (you are drawing meshes walls doors etc.)I believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convexpolygons can be much more efficient than those that can drawconcave / self intersecting polygons. This efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line.Complex (figure 8 type polygons) can be a bit trickier.The less than N sides specification especially if it is a very small number like 3 or 4 allow othe optimisations to be made.Thus for a high speed game application I think you are looking forcode that exploits and is hence limited to drawing simple convexpolygons.  >finding something like that are pretty remote, so I guess I'd need the source>with it.

The reflected| ray (R) and the transmitted ray (T) is calculated from the formulae.| | Calling the routine recursively on R and T will return the colours | along the rays (R and T) as rCol and tCol.

First of all (this is NOT a snide response), if you're confused aboutthis issue, you will stumble over a lot of other things as well.  I suggestthat the weakness is your reference material.  Get "An Introduction to RayTracing" by Andrew Glassner for very good coverage of the raytracingalgorithm.  You could also refer to the 2nd edition of Foley & Van Dam.    On to the question.  The simple answer is that you just keep adding upall the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity.  Forexample, if your intensity values range from 0.0 to 1.0, then keep adding upand clamp the resultant values to 1.0 (you might have to clamp the lowerbound to 0.0 if you have dark bulbs, but that's another issue =^).  So, youget some illumination equation like this:        I = Lambient + Ldiffuse(light[n]) + Lreflected + Ltransparent    The contribution due to reflection is just summed with the lightintensity, as is the light due to transparency.  Now, a slightly lesshand-waving illumination equation is this:        I = KaLa + KdLd(light[n]) + KrLr + KtLt    That is, each component of the illumination equation is governed by thematerial constants Ka, Kd, Kr and Kt.  So the maximum you can get fromtransparency for a given object, for example, might be [0.4, 0.1, 0.5] for apurple-colored glass object.    Hopefully this answers your question.  I'll forward my "illuminationequation sermon" to you also.______________________________________________________________________________Steve Hollasch                                   Kubota Pacific Computer, Inc.hollasch@kpc.com                                 Santa Clara, California

On the drawing you have a set ofreference points whose true x,y positions are known.  Now you digitize the drawing manually (in this case, using YaronDanon's excellent Digitize program).  That is, you use a program whichconverts cursor positions to x,y and saves those values when you clickthe mouse.Upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that comeout of the digitizing process differ in small but significant waysfrom the known true values.  This is understandable because thescanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there aresuccessive sources of distortion such as differential expansion andcontraction of paper, errors introduced in the printing process,scanner errors and what have you.The errors are not uniform over the entire drawing, so "global"adjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y, orrotating the whole drawing, are not satisfactory.So the question is: does any kind soul know of an algorithm forremoving such distortion?  In particular, if I have three sets ofpoints Reference(x,y) (the known true values)DistortedReference(x,y) (the same points, with known errors)DistortedData(x,y) (other points, with unknown errors)what function of Reference and Distorted could I apply toDistortedData to remove the errors.I suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distortedreference points as resulting from the projection of a "bumpy" 3dsurface, solving for the surface and then "flattening" it to removethe errors in the other data points.Any kind and informed soul out there have any ideas, or better yet,pointers to treatments of the same or similar problems?Thanks,Earl

The quantization to 16 graysintroduces some ugly bands in the pictures, which can be nicely eliminatedby dithering. Up to now I have used XV to process the images, but now Iwould like to automate the procedure.The problem is that XV can't (I think) convert images automatically, and theobvious alternative PNMPLUS (PPMQUANT and PNMDITHER) don't even get close toXV's quality. PNMDITHER apparently dithers in RGB, even though the imagesare in grayscale. The dithering routine in XV seems to use the natural imagecolors for the dither. Is this or any similar routine available in thepublic domain? If so, where?  -- Niclas Mattssonexjob-17@math.chalmers.se

I've been chasing fractalcompression for a few years, and I still don't believe in it.  If it's sogreat, how come we don't see it competing with JPEG?  'Cause it can't,I'll wager.Actually, I have wagered, I quit trying to make fractal compressionwork- and I was trying- because I don't think it's a reasonablealternative to other techniques.  It is neat, though. :-)I'll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal.  That's why Idon't think fractal compression as it is widely explained ispractical.  I know Barnsley and Sloan have some tricks up theirsleeves that make their demos work, but I don't see anyone using it in areal product.  It's been six years since Iterated Systems was formed,right?"There are always going to be questions until there's a productout there," Sloan replies.

Computer  graphics has played  adecisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists tobuild, visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects. While computer scientists are conversant in the language of theirown discipline, they are often unfamiliar with the terminology,simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists.Similarly, chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigmsand technological advances in graphical computing. This interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gapbetween computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistryresearchers who wish to be more than just casual users ofprepackaged graphics software. Although this is not intended tobe a course in computational chemistry or drug design, data setsfrom chemical research problems will be used in lab and studentswill be encouraged to bring data sets of their own. Lab exercisesand projects will be carried out using data-flow programming(IBM Visualization Data Explorer software) and students will haveaccess to Cornell Theory Center computing resources, including videorecording equipment. Audience:  researchers and students in the chemical and biological           sciences interested in integrating state-of-the-art           computer graphics into their research; computer scientists           wishing to gain familiarity with a major application of           scientific visualization.            The class size will be limited to 25 participants on a           first-come first-served basis. Level:     Graduate/advanced undergraduate, 1 or 2 Credits. May be taken           without credit as a workshop. Calculus, linear algebra           and introductory chemistry required. Familiarity with Unix,           X-windows and C is useful but not required.

The intersection of 3 planes methodlooks best, but my implementation based on a short article in Graphics Gems I doesn't work.  I may be misinterpreting, of course.I had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favorof dot and cross products, but the former may actually be better.  In eithercase a matrix determinant needs to be computed (implicitly in the solutionof linear equations).To get the planes, I was taking the midpoint of the line from, say,P1 to P2, and setting the normal as the "normalized" vector from P1 to P2.These just plugged into the formula in Graphics Gems.  HOwever, the resultingcenter point is only occasionally equidistant from all 4 of my test points(for different tests).  My matrix/vector math is very rusty, but it looks likeI need to verify the formula, or use the simultaneous equation solution, whichwill require bringing in another routine I don't have (but should be easy tofind).Another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by 2 setsof 3 points, and intersecting the normals from there.  This would also definethe circle center.  However, small numerical imprecisions would make thelines not intersect.  Supposedly 3 planes HAVE to intersect in a uniquepoint if they are not parallel.EdThanks to all who answered so far.-- Ed BolsonUniversity of Washington  Cardiovascular Research               (206)543-4535bolson@u.washington.edu (preferred)bolson@max.bitnet                bolson@milton.u.washington.edu (if you must)

The user interface to a SUIT program is editable even whilethe application runs.  Programs using SUIT are written in ANSI-C.  SUITruns on UNIX/X, Color Macintosh, DOS, and Windows ; a single applicationsource file may be recompiled to run on all platforms.SUIT was designed to be easy to learn - we view it as "the Pascal of UItoolkits."  Learning from a 10-page written tutorial, our undergraduateshave been able to use SUIT productively after 2 hours.  This is possiblebecause we rely more heavily on interactive tools than previous toolkits,and because the entire system as been designed to be easy to learn.SUIT's biggest advantages are:- it runs across a very wide variety of hardware platforms- it has a documented 2 hour learning curve for beginners- it's very lightweight; relatively small amount of codeSUIT has now been distributed to thousands of sites, and has reachedall continents but Antarctica. It has also been used in graduatecourses at some universities, including Stanford.The suit-users mailing list now has nearly 100 participants and hasmessage traffic of 10-15 per day. Some users have unsubcribed already,citing the volume of mail as the main reason. We feel that thisjustifies a newsgroup.Details of the newsgroup------------------------comp.windows.suit will be an unmoderated forum that will handle allaspects of SUIT, including:- questions about SUIT- bug reports- distribution of contributory code- announcement of new releasesVoting------Voting will begin when this CFV is posted, and will end on May 14, 1993at 23:59 EST. In order for the group to be created, there must be a 2/3majority of yes votes to no votes, and there must be 100 more yes votesthan no votes.To vote yes, please send mail to:suit-yes@uvacs.cs.virginia.eduTo vote no, please send mail to:suit-no@uvacs.cs.virginia.eduAll votes will receive an acknowledgement. If there is a problem,please DO NOT send mail to either of these addresses; send them tothe one below.The subject field must be unambiguous; for example, "I vote for/againstcomp.windows.suit" Conditional votes, which may receive an acknowledgementinitially, will be rejected. No anonymous votes will be accepted.If you wish to change your vote, mail a new vote; only the most recentvote by a user will be counted.If you have problems, questions, or comments, please mail them to:suit-admin@uvacs.cs.virginia.eduwhere we will attempt to respond as quickly as possible.Over this period, two additional CFVs will be posted, along withan acknowledgement of valid votes.Thanks,The SUIT Newsgroup Team

We use it toproduce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our localnetwork.

It was promoted asan inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the makerof the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has beenunable to deliver.  Our system produces "near VHS" quality at 30 fields persecond (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60fields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that somefind distracting.If you can get past this problem, you'll find the Adobe Premier editing software quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands ofdifferent effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.Because of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you've everused (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you'll recognize the methodologyand the user interface.The total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21" Apple mon-itor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc),Composite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about $20,000.For you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a qualitythat will satisfy most of your clients.  Even though you can perform moreeffects than a toasterhead can imagine, an Amiga based off-line based systemwill look better.We use both Macs and Amigas for our video work.

I suspect I'll implement the display controller as a server process that handles graphics requests, queued on a mailbox, one at a time.

We recently posted an RFD announcing the OTG (Open Telematic Group)that will concern itself with the developement of such applicationand that it would incorporate NAPLPS, JPEG, MPEG, Voice, IVR, FAXSprites, Animation(fli, flc, etc...).At present only DOS and UNIX environment is being worked on and itour hope that we can generate enough interest where all the majorplatform can be accomodated via a plaform independent API/TOOLKIT/SDKWe are of the mind that it is about time that such project and groupbe form to deal with these issues.We want to setup a repository where these files may be access such asSimte20 and start putting together a OTG FAQ.If you have some or any information that in your opinion would be of interest to the OTG community and you like to see included in ourfirst FAQ please send it email to the address below.

I have seen it described, andthe algiorithm seems a  little bit long.  I developed my own method, whichrequires that the points be in a counter-clockwise order, and returnswhether you are looking at the back or the front, similar to the plane eqnmethod.  It uses few calculations however, basically it is severalcomparisons.  The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after thetransformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on thescreen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand.  Mymethod basically figures out whether the points that will appear on thescreen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  When looking at the back ofsomething, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, somerely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you arelooking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.

Plus it offers a full range of resolutions, high refresh rates as well as unique proprietary performance features.  The card is available in both 16-bit ISA bus and 32-bit VESA Local bus versions (models 8500 AND 8500VL).        With 1MB DRAM on board, the WINDOWSVGA 24 card offers maximum resolution up to 1,280 x 1,024 and supports a refresh rate of 72Hz at 800 x 600 and resolution up to 1,024 x 768 non-interlaced. Both models provide performance many times greater than standard SVGA boards, yet conform to all current video standards.        WINDOWSVGA 24 features Genoa's FlickerFree(tm) technology, which eliminates screen flash and flicker to make viewing much more comfortable.  the cards also come with Safescan(tm), a utility developed by Genoa to eliminate the black border around the screen and thereby provide 100-percent screen use for overscanning monitors.        WINDOWSVGA model 8500VL takes full advantage of the speed offered by the new VESA Local bus technology.  Most VL bus cards will only handle data transfers up to 33MHz, but the 8500VL will transfer data at the full speed of the CPU, up to 50MHz.  Genoa is also offering this card in the "TurboBahn" combination packaged with their TURBOEXPRESS 486VL motherboard.        Built around the Cirrus Logic GD-5426 GUI accelerator, WINDOWSVGA 24 offers the user an exceptional price/performance value.  Genoa's advanced proprietary drivers act to "turbocharge" the chip, thereby providing an affordable accelerator card with power and performance that surpass many of the more highly priced chip cards.  The Genoa user will enjoy optimal speed and reliability for such programs as Windows, AutoCAD, AutoShade, 3D Studio, OS/2, OrCAD and more.  Driver updates and product bulletins are available on Genoa's BBS at (408) 943-1231.        Genoa Systems manufactures and markets an extensive line of graphics adapters, motherboards, audio and multimedia cards for IBM-compatible personal computers.  All products come with a two year limited warranty on parts and labor.  Genoa products are currently distributed worldwide through authorized distributors, resellers, VARs and systems integrators.

And lots more that I can't remember right now...Anyway, it's not as expensive as some of the other animation/renderingpackages.

However, although it is supposed to workwith an ET-4000 with Hi-colour RAMDAC, the colours on screenbehave as if the top 2 bits of colour information are missing,and red, green, blue signals are swapped around.Rombo has suggested that this may be due to insufficientbuffering on the feature connector outputs, and is happy tosell me a buffer device for 50 pounds.I would rather save about 45 pounds, and build my own. I assumeit would require (for example) a 74F244 buffer IC (or two).Can anyone help?

So here it comes:CView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the mostannoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has todo with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no controlover where it places its temp files: it just places them in its"current directory".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell)when it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CViewdoesn't check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colourinformation. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the "dithering", again writinganother file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing thissecond file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it doesthe last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file toyour screen again.  (It does this last "recopy" operation for its"fit to screen" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.) The result of this process is the following:       1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all        you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of        data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never        realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren't performed.     2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for        the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the        dithering and writes to the screen card.        However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data        from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)        one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which        there was room on the disk.This is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the generalidea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in detailsabout file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficientdisk space.  The temp files for large JPEG's (1200x900 and bigger) can bevery large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excessof 6 Meg free disk space.CView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file froma floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on thefloppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FATtable? I can't remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly insertedfloppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possiblyunrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for aprogram to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Filesmenu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves thehi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at oncewhen it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take tosort a directory listing?With much thanks to the originator of this article. +=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+ |        Rene Walter          |          renew@stack.urc.tue.nl           | +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | "Will I drown in tears of sorrow, Is there hope for tomorrow,           | |  Will this world ever get better, Can't we all just live together       | |  I don't wanna live in strife  , I just wanna live my life              | |  I deserve to have a future..."                                         | |                                     -The Good Girls    "Future"         | +=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+

In so doing, they eventually come to a point where theyhave a new architecture, and the only upgrade path is to replace thesystem.  And the particular system he was complaining about was (incomputer lifetimes) relatively old.On statement (2), I felt DEC's history of providing upgrades was not farsuperior than the industry "average", and that, in my opinion, SGI'shistory is better than DEC's.(And what is DEC doing with it's MIPS based DECstation line?  Are theygoing to "abandon" it for their Alpha based line, or provide an upgradepath to R4400's and TFP's and R5's?)--

This is due to a missing XRESOLUTION and YRESOLUTIONtag which apparently is required (or at least believed to be required) forvalid TIFF.  I have checked both xv 2.x and xv 3.x and neither of thesedo indeed copy these tags.Has anyone out there hacked in the fixes for xv to support these tags?I have been told that I could find some code in tiff/tools/tiffcp.c, butthat directory is one of many of the tiff group not distributed with xv.  Ihope to obtain the original tiff src and look at it, but would preferto find code already known to work in xv.-- :s :s Larry W.

I needed it for my bezier curve approximation routine.In some cases (generating offset curves) loops can occur. I now have afast method of detecting the generation of a curve with a loop. AlthoughI did not follow the article above strictly. The check if the fourth controlpoint lies in the the loop area, which is bounded by two parabolas andone ellips is too complicated. Instead I enlarged the loop-area andsurrounded it by for straight lines. The check is now simple and fast andmy approximation routine never ever outputs self-intersecting bezier curvesagain!Ferdinand.

While Iwas working with it this morning, the screen started to flicker a little,which I thought was odd since I do use a surge-protector for my computer andall peripherals.  It only did this for a second and then stopped.I left the room for several minutes and, when I returned, the screen wascompletely dim, not blank, but very very dim.  The contrast slider stillworked so that I could adjust it to where I could *faintly* make out whatwas on the screen but the brightness slider had absolutely *no* effect.I was plugged-in at the time (i.e., not using the battery) but I stilltried switching the battery, changing the power-saver features, etc., etc.,all to no avail.Has anyone else experienced anything like this?  If this just means that Ineed to replace the screen then I guess I'll have to but I thought that the"death" of my LCD screen would be a little less dramatic when it eventuallyhappened.  I didn't want to take it in to be repaired before I asked on thenet about this because I already know what they'll say: "Yep, you gotta havethis replaced and it's gonna cost you $???."I've only had the computer for about 21 months.  Is that a reasonable lifecycle for a LCD display?  Oh, I guess I ought to give specifics here: thebrand is Compudyne (Is this a reputable company?), it's a 386SX @ 20 MHz.I forget the model number exactly and I was too ticked off to write it downbefore coming in to work today.If anyone can help me, PLEASE give me any advice you might have.  I'm notopposed to having it replaced, but I'd rather not if it's not absolutelynecessary.  If you wouldn't mind, please e-mail me at mike@mik.uky.edubut if you'd rather post I'll be checking back here in a couple of days.BTW, if the answer to this question is already in a FAQ somewhere, feelfree to flame away but I would ask that you also include the location andname of the FAQ if you don't mind.Thanks in advance for any help...-Mike Mattone(mike@mik.uky.edu)

I was alsoshocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills byabout 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  This seems huge, but is only1/256 of the dynamic range.  In those terms it doesn't seem so bad.  Whatis happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, duemainly to roundoff, I believe.  So the polygon is not planar in z, but ismore like a Ruffles potato chip.  Ditto with lines.  When you start/end atdifferent x/y values, the "ridges" are out of phase, resulting in thestitch effect.  You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygonright on top of another, but with different vertices.  You will likely seea smeared effect where they overlap.  Example:  Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)      Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)Your implementation is correct.  In fact, we do a similar trick whenrendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaceswith isoparametric lines.  Without the trick, the lines appear stitched, asyou say.  When the application draws lines/polygons independently, thesystem does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so theapplication must do it.  This is what you have discovered and are doing.Bravo!(Note to IBM'ers:  The information given here has been previously disclosedthrough proper channels so I'm not giving away any new unpublished info.)--   Mark Einkauf     [ einkauf@austin.ibm.com ]  IBM - Advanced Workstations and Systems - Graphics Systems  Austin TX * Views and opinions expressed herein are not necessarily those of IBM Corp. *

There is an XView version called xvgr forSuns. Collectively, these 2 tools are known as ACE/gr. Compiling xmgr requires the Motif toolkit version 1.1 and X11R4 - xmgr will not compile under X11R3/Motif 1.0x.  X11R5+Motif 1.2 should work fine, but I've not been able to test this.For a summary of xmgr's capabilities, get the file BLURB fromeither site mentioned below.Available via anonymous ftp to either:ftp.ccalmr.ogi.edu:/CCALMR/pub/acegr/xmgr-2.10.tar.Zorexport.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/acegr/xmgr-2.10.tar.ZPlease remember to set the transfer type to binary.I am not able to E-mail xmgr, but there are services provided by various Internet sites that allow ftp by mail.

For those without Motif on SUNs, I'll provide a compiled binary (eventually).I've begun re-writing ACE/gr in C++, the initial target isMS-Windows.Improvements/fixes from 2.09 are: * The explicit placement of items in popups has been replacedwith manager widgets. The previous method led to problemson some servers (all widgets in a popup would get scrunchedinto the upper left corner). * Many set operations can now be done in the File/Status popup. * The PostScript driver should do a better job of producingEPSF'able output.A few things remain to do (I could use some ideas/help on these):1. Replace the Hershey fonts used for on-screen text with thexvertext routines posted to the net by Alan Richardson.The problem here is how to include support for this in theuser interface.2. Add support for Adobe Font Metrics. I could use some PD or freelydistributable routines for this.3. Add support for pattern fills in the PostScript driver. Presentlythe only way to get hardcopy for fills is to import MIF intoFrameMaker. Need PS routines for pattern fills.4. Add support for HDF/NetCDF.

I figure that the plotter is worth about $300 and the pens are worth atleast another $200 more..  One thing is certain, you won't need topurchase any pens for quite a while...  All of the packaged pens weresealed so they are all still fresh.  The rest were capped and seem tofunction as well.    I'd be willing to sell the pens seperate if anyone is interested injust them.

We also know something about VR from ABC news magazine and|> Computer Graphics World magazine.Unfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effectsfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computergraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Eachframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render onhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphicswould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 framesper second).|> |> We certainly want to know more about VR.  Who are the leading|> companies,|> agencies, universities?  What machines support VR (i.e. SGI, Sun4,|> HP-9000, BIM-6000, etc.)?It depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.True immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visualdatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  Thisis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilottraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping ofthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motionof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics systemmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complexdata representations.Additionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15frames per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhapsdue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what wasvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (thegraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constantframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in generaldoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified theUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-timeoperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. Uniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-timeoperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, noteven SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only ourmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation dueto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.From a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environmentsrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-timemulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systemson the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2systems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularlyimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is anunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.|>  What kind of graphics languages are used with VR|> (GL, opengl, Phigs, PEX, GKS, etc.)?You can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to developVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

This is possible becauseit's the same theory used by most color scanners.  I am not looking for the obvious solution which is to buy a color scanner but what I do need is those equations becasue I am starting to write software which will automate the conversion process.  I would really appreciate it if someone would repost the 3 equations/3 unknowns.   Thanks for the help!!!

Of courseJPEG and MPEG come to mind as the formats of choice for thevarious files.  However, from what I read on the Net, it seemsas if there are several different forms of each of these.What I want to do, is settle on a file format which I can counton as being a standard format 10 years from now.  I know Apple is goingto support Quicktime on the new Power PC's and, so thismay be the format of choice.What format does Apple's Quicktime use for their products?  I guessit is some kind of MPEG for their motion picture. Is it any differentthan standard MPEG files?Thanx for any info!Art.Pollarda@xray.byu.edu

(I'm a littlefuzzy on the breakdown of the graphics chips and RAM/VRAM capacity).It was demonstrated at a recent gathering at the Electronic Cafe inSanta Monica, CA. From 3DO, RJ Mical (of Amiga/Lynx fame) and HalJosephson (sp?) were there to talk about the machine and their plan. Wegot to see the unit displaying full-screen movies using the CompactVideo codec(which was nice, very little blockiness showing clips from Jaws and Backdraft)... and a very high frame rate to boot (like 30fps).Note however that the 3DO's screen resolution is 320x240.CompactVideo is pretty amazing... I also wanted to point out that QuickTimedoes indeed slow down when one dynamically resizes material as was statedabove... I'm sure if the material had been compressed at the large sizethen it would play back fine (I have a Q950 and do this quite a bit). Theprice of generality... personally I don't use the dynamic sizing of moviesoften, if ever. But playing back stuff at its original size is plenty quickon the latest 040 machines.I'm not sure how a Centris/20MHz 040 stacks up against the 25 MHz ARM inthe 3DO box. Obviously the ARM is faster, but how much?Rob BarrisQuicksilver Software Inc.rbarris@orion.oac.uci.edu

I have had>a quick look in the computer graphics literature with no results.>Perhaps someone who has access to medical information could help? Certainly. Reference follows. Bear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be calledred/green colour blind. One, protanopia, is caused by a lack or majordysfunction of the L cones, those that respond best to longwavelengths. This gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination andalso means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision.The other, deuteranopia, is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although itcan also be caused by a lack of the L-M cone difference signals in the retina.It also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected. Unlike protanopia, reds are not dimmer than  normal.On a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computergraphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colourdeficiency. Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from thispoint. For protanopia the point is at u'=0.61,v'=0.51, very close to the far redcorner. For deuteranopia, the point is at u'=-4.75, v'=1.31Note that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightlydifferent values for these depending on the precise details of the experimentalsetup, random errors, and so on. The values quoted are typical.So if all colours on a line are seen as the same, which colour is actually seen?This problem has now been solved. Tests on people with one normal eye and oneaffected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder ontowhich all the colours collapse. For protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm onthe spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe); for deuteranopes the line isvery similar,  joining 477nm and 579nm.*So* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia orduuteranopia:1) Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram2) Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point3) Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line4) This is the new chromaticity. The best reference for this is Meyer, G.W. & Greenberg, D.P. (1988) 'Colourdefective vision and computer graphics displays', IEEE Computer Graphics andApplications 8(5) 28-40.You will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are notfamiliar with the CIE XYZ colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram.>I would like to write a program (probably a PPM filter) to allow>previewing of images to check for sufficient contract for colour>blind users. Not being colour blind myself, this is a bit difficult!Yes this is certainly possible. You will need the chromaticities of the redgreen and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, andthe chromaticity of the white point. This information can be measured, orobtained from the manufacturer. I posted a list of some monitor chromaticities acouple of weeks ago.The procedure, for each pixel (!) is as follows. (Some lookup tables might be ahelp here.)A) convert RGB to CIE XYZ. This is a simple 3*3 matrix multiplication once youhave the monitor data.B) retaining the Y component for later, convert XYZ to chromaticity coordinates u'v'using u' = 4X/(X+15Y+3Z), v' = 9Y/(X+15Y+3Z)C) find the equation of the line as in step 2 aboveD) find the intersection as in step 3E) convert back from u'v' to XYZ, using the Y value from step AF) Ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor; if not, move italong a line in XYZ space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black andwhite) until it is displayable.>Please email replies - I will summarise and repost if there is>sufficient interestDone; also posted for the rest of us.--Chris Lilley----------------------------------------------------------------------------Technical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training ProjectComputer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, Manchester, UK.

Basically, you look into a room that lookssimilar to the following:                             xxxx                         xxxxx   xxxx                     xxxx    x       xxxx                 xxxx        x           xxxx             xxxx     2      xxxx     1      xxxx             x           xxxx    xxxx           x             x       xxxx            xxxx       x             x   xxxx             o      xxxx   x             xxxx              3 /|\\         xxxx                 xxxx            /~\\     xxxx                     xxxx            xxxx                         xxxx    xxxx                             xxxxThe good thing about this perspective is that you can look and movearound in three dimensions and still maintain your peripheral vision. [*]Since your viewpoint is always the same, the routines can be hard-codedfor a particular vantage.  In my case, wall two's rising edge has a slopeof 1/4. (I'm also using Mode X, 320x240).I've run into two problems; I'm sure that other readers have tried thisbefore, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran apacked->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the "jaggies."  I'mnow considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary).Is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed,thus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distortthe original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed.Has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise shearedshape?Currently I take:  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64and produce:                         1  2  3  433 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  849 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12            53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16                        57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32                                    61 62 63 64Line 1 follows the slope.  Line 2 is directly under line 1.Line 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels.  Line 4 is under line 3.This fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels.  Butit causes distortions.  Has anyone come up with a better way?Perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmapalready skewed?Are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective?I was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering.Locations are stored in (x,y,z) form.[*] For those of you who noticed, the top lines of wall 2 (and wall 1)*are* parallel with its bottom lines.  This is why there appears tobe an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outsideof a cube, depending on your mood).  There are no vanishing points.This simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don't have tochange size as they move about in the room).  I've decided that thisapproximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enoughdistance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object ina real perspective drawing.Hopefully the "context" of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torcheshanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity.Thanks in advance for any help.-- Till next time,                \\o/   \\o/                                V \\o/ V     email:pinky@tamu.edu<>  Sam  Inala  <>                 V

Below is a very shortdescription of the process which we use; if you have further questions,feel free to poke me via e-mail.================================================================*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.   Consider deleting these edges.1) Now, there are two goals:    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)'s)       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured        using the digitized (x,y)'s).2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For   example:    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the       Reference(x,y).     b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge       the correct length (where "correct" is the DigitizedLength).        Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).alpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Considerhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insiston the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want tobalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in lengthof the edges.WARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must beobserved (essentially, you can't allow the convex hull to change, andyou can't allow triangles to "fold over" neighboring triangles.  Both ofthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion ofindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using the current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from theoriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time wasprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try andchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have morecompute power than you know what to do with, you might consider havingevery point interact with every other point....but first read up onlinear solutions to the n-body problem.There are lots of papers in the last 10 years of SIGGRAPH proceedings onsprings, constraints,  and energy calculations which are relevant.

People seem perfectly capable>dealing with these others.Well, yeah, but unlike TIFF they all do substantially more than encoderectangular bitmaps.  And the others are hardly trouble free.  I hear thatit is quite common for CGM implementations not to interoperate.The annoying thing about TIFF is that is that along with the 50 usefuloptions, there are 100 stupid options.  The most egregious example is thatrather than picking a byte order and bit order and using it consistentlyin all TIFF files, byte and bit order are options and all TIFF readers onall machines, no matter what their natural byte order, have to be preparedto do byte swapping.  There are four slightly different FAX formats --again, any one of them would have been adequate.  RGB images can be storedby pixel or by component, complexity without function, etc, etc.  I alsonote that the TIFF doc says that Aldus' experiments show that LZW reliablycompresses as well or better than any of the FAX formats, suggesting thatnone of the FAX formats are really useful.What's worse, a lot of the formats aren't even implemented very well,e.g., LZW limits code words to 12 bits, while 14 or 16 bits would haveprovided substantially better compression.  And the LZW method compressesbytes rather than pixels.But the absolute worst thing about TIFF is that any vendor can registerproprietary TIFF codes and formats without even publicly documenting them.This means that there is NO WAY to write a TIFF reader that can reliablyread all incoming TIFF files.

I have seen a paper that quoted 10 bits per channelof 12 bits for computational precision. More than that would seem to be wasted.Perhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits torepresent the full range - RGB is a cube so it is a compact encoding.Most likely however is that there are two separate 24 bit (8 bits per component)frame buffers. This set up, called double buffering, allows a complex 3d pictureto be built up on one buffer while the other buffer (containing the previousframe) is displayed. This makes for smoother animation.>(sadly, I have access to none of them.  Just a DEC 5000/25.  Sigh.)Well hey if you want to brag about numbers, the 5000 range can take a PXG Turbo+card with 96 bits per pixel. Full double buffering (Two 24 bit buffers), a 24bit Z buffer and an extra 24 bit buffer for off screen image storage.Mind you the card costs more than your workstation.--Chris Lilley----------------------------------------------------------------------------Technical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training ProjectComputer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, Manchester, UK.

There is a sphere of in radius.This last case can be achieved with 3 colinier points and any 4th pointby taking the 4th point and pairs of the first 3 parallel lines will be producedit can also be achieved byIf all 4 points are coplanar but are not on one circle. It seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the 4 points are coplanar.The algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar.(4 points being colinear => coplanar)Testing if the 4th point is coplanar when the plane of the first 3 pointshas been found is trivial.>An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed>by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the>center of the sphere.

He was probably confused bythe fact that QT is locked to an internal timecode, and will play in thesame amount of time on any machine. However, an LC will drop frames inorder to keep the sound and video synced up.The Centris and Quadras have similar CPUs and will thus boast similarperformance, though the Quadras will be a bit faster due to marginallyfaster clock speeds and somewhat different architecture.>   Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac washaving>a little bit of trouble.  And this wasn't even from the hardisk!

One of the new codecs in v1.5 allows video at nearlytwice the size and the same frame rate as what version 1.0 could handle.The Centris 650 I saw was a plain-vanilla, with the exception of the nicespeakers that were playing the sound, and the software was Movie Player,the QT player Apple includes with the software.>   Don't misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this.No problem -- it still surprises me that Quicktime is able to do thethings it does as well as it can.========================================================================Sean McMains              | Check out the Gopher    | Phone:817.565.2039University of North Texas | New Bands Info server   | Fax  :817.565.4060P.O.

Features===========DMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC: - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported) - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA) - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale - color-space selection - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic) - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for   VGA and many Super-VGAs...4. Technical information========================The player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].The IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2](not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zerocoefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'algorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Maindifference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supportedalgorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option touse a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturationdominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality ofthe dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).Restricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributedover this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space pointsis thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at theexpense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.Saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lyingsomewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximatedby primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead ofconstant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to thelower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes thanto hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improveon NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redishareas....--Stefan Eckart, stefan@lis.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de

I have 1meg of memory on my board and according to all the booksand info I have read I am only (at maximum) using 256k of it. There is away to do this in standard VGA cause I have seen vidoe paging (written inassembly, which I don't know) written into apps hat use mode 13h. To getany speed at all you have to do this. How do I do it?2) The vesa standard. What gives here. I have read most of whatthe net has to offer on VESA and as far as coding for VESA goes most ofthe advice is cryptic at best. Where do I get public domain info that willtell me in "mostly plain" english how the vesa calls work.My biggest gripe is about number 1. I have bought graphics books,I have asked graphics professors, I have hunted the net through bothgopher, and archie, I ahave asked apps programmers and it is like there issome lock on this information. Graphics programming books tell alot ofprogrammiing algorithm information, but they always fall short of tellingyou how to really control the video bios. What are all the calls folks, Iknow there are people out there that know how to doall tis stuff. Whereare you, and why haven't you written a book yet?

Image analysis software - Image processing and display==========================================================PC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software)======================IMDISP------  IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions  [PC and Macs]LabVIEW 2---------  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the  "program" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual  instrument.  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has  utility functions for memory management data communications and  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for  the development of custom code.)Ultimage Concept VI-------------------  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and  characterization.  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can  be imported.  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.  Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom  modules.  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even  hole filling.  The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494  707-579-1733IPLab Spectrum--------------  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a  movie command for cycling through windows.Macintosh-based tools=====================NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more---------------------------------  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results  from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,  documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from  ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been  developed by Spyglass.

It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,  tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting  things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of  images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined  convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw  data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also  does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,  though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac  that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version  from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)PhotoMac--------  Data Translation, Inc. 100 Locke Dr. Marlboro, MA 01752 508-481-3700PhotoPress----------  Blue Solutions 3039 Marigold Place Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 805-492-9973PixelTools and TCL-Image------------------------  "Complete family of PixelTools (hardware accelerator and applications  software) for scientific image processing and analysis.

Paragon Imagine 171 Lincoln St. Lowell, MA 01852 508-441-2112Adobe Photoshop---------------  The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey  scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..  Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA  94039-7900 415-961-4400ColorStudio and ImageStudio---------------------------  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a  variety of powerful selection tools including the "auto selection tool"  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close  hues, color range and mask.ImageStudio: Don't know...

Dapple Systems, 355 W. Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283Digital Darkroom----------------  The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and  editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to  select part of an image simply by "painting" it. A new polyline  selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide  selections.  A brush lets the operator "paint" with a selected portion  of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.  This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale  images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as  powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.  Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr.

It has  the capability of reading Erdas files. Functions include; image  enhancement, 3D and contour plots, image statistics, supervised and  unsupervised classification, PCA and other image transformations. There  is also a means (Image Operation Language or IOL) by which you can write  your own transformations. There is no image rectification, however  Dimple is compatable with MAPII. The latest version is 1.4 and it is in  the beta stage of testing. Dimple was initially developed as a teaching  tool and it is very good for this purpose."  "Dimple  runs on a colour Macintosh.  It is a product still in its  development phase.. i.e. it doesn't have all the inbuilt features of  other packages, but is coming along nicely.  It has its own inbuilt  language for writing "programs" for processing an image, defining  convolution filters etc. Dimple is a full mac application with pull down  menus etc...

The tool has over 80 mathematical filter  variations: "Laplacian, medium noise filter", etc.  Files can be saved  as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can't be imported).  MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109Image Analyst-------------  An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative  data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in  radiographs.  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or  a disk-stored image.  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

MIRAGE------  It's image processing software written by Jim Gunn at the  Astrophysics Dept at Princeton. It will run on a PC among other platforms.  It is a Forth based system - i.e. a Forth language with many image  processing displaying functions built in. DATA TRANSLATION SOURCE BOOK----------------------------  The Data Translation company in Massachusetts publishes a free book  containing vendors of data analysis hardware and software which is  compatible with Data Translation and other frame grabbers.  Surely you can find much more PC-related stuff in it.MAXEN386--------  A couple of Canadians have written a program named MAXEN386 which does  maximum entropy image deconvolution. Their company is named Digital  Signal Processing Software, or something like that, and the software is  mentioned in an article in Astronomy Magazine, either Jan or Feb 92  (an article on CCD's vs film). JANDEL SCIENTIFIC (JAVA)------------------------  Another software package (JAVA) is put out by Jandel Scientific.   Jandel Scientific, 65 Koch Road, Corte Madera, CA 94925, (415) 924-8640,  (800) 874-1888.Microbrian----------  Runs on an MS dos platform and uses a 32 bit graphics card  (Vista), or an about to be released version will support a number of  super VGA cards.  Its a full blown remote sensed data processing  system.. It is menu driven (character based screen), but is does not use  a windowed user interface. Its is hardware protected with a dongle.  Mbrian = micro Barrier reef Image Anaysis System. It was developed by  CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Organization) and is  marketed/ supported by:  MPA Australia (51 Lusher Road, Croydon, Victoria  tel + 61 3 724 4488     fax  +61 3 724 4455)  There are educational and commercial prices, but be prepared to set  aside $A10k for the first educational licence.  Subsequent ones come  cheaper (they need to!) It has installed sites worldwide.  It is widely  used at ANU.MicroImage----------  The remote sensing lab here at Dartmouth currently uses Terra-Mar's  MicroImage, on 486 PCs with some fancy display hardware.

Email to iraf@noao.edu for more details.  Apparently this is one of the _de facto_ standards in the astronomical  image community. They issue a newsletter also.  They seem to support very well their users. Works with VMS also last  I heard, and practically has its own shell on top of the VMS/Unix shells.  It's suggested that you get a copy of saoimage for display under X windows.

Contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu  (also see the UseNet Newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits)  Built by NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, HQ in Charlottesville,  VA, sites in NM, AZ, WV).  Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,  or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)  available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),  directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building  the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.     This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is  primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy  data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a  synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.  There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based  graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware  functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and  can do image arithmetic, etc.    The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is  available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and  Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.     There is currently a project - "AIPS++" - underway to rewrite the  algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an  object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for  free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be  in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with  contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and  Australia to name a few. LABOimage---------  (version 4.0 is out for X11) It's written in C, and currently  runs on Sun 3/xxx, Sun 4/xxx (OS3.5, 4.0 and 4.0.3) under SunView.  The expert system for image segmentation is written in Allegro Common Lisp.  It was used on the following domains: computer science (image analysis),   medicine, biology, physics.

Feature Description  DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and  spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of  modules.  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and  ratioing.  Host Configuration Requirements  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific  applications programs.  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be  interactively driven through this control.  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be  added to further enhance referenced imagery.  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional  processing of remote sensed data.

Select a chunk of five band data from a pass,  automatic navigation, calibrate it to Albedo and Temp, convert that to  byte, register it to predesigned window, all relatively automatically  and carefree.  It has no classification routines to speak of, but it isn't that  difficult to write your own with their programmer's module.  Very small operation: one designs, one codes, one sells. Been around for  a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000  with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display"HIPS----(Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)  Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image  processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil  exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well  as a huge user-contributed library.  Feature description  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users  become effective using HIPS on their first day.  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX  ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual  pages, and on-line documentation.  Host Configuration Requirements  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.  Availability  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other   palettes can be generated.Supported functions include such niceties as the following:o  image & image: + - / * interpolationo  image & constant: + - / *o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,   line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to   any specified angle.o  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan   bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to   region target mean, median, or modal value.o  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,   collapse 2-d image into 1-d image.o  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of   region of an image.o  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot   keyword values for a set of images.o  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,   brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower   luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon.

What I mean by "compositing" is, say I have a live video clip   (digitized) panning around a living room, and a computer-generated   bird flying around the screen.  I want to combine these two series of   pictures so that everywhere where the bird frames are black, I want   the living room picture to show through.  Yes, I realize I can do this   with a genlock, and I do own a genlock, but I want to be able to do   manual compositing also.  It's ok if I have to composite one frame at   a time; I assumed I'd have to do that anyway.  But being able to   composite a series of frames would be even better.   I've looked around and I haven't found a PC package that will perform   this.  Help, please!If you can get the live animation and the computer-generated animationinto AutoDesk Animator .FLI or .FLC format, AutoDesk Animator will dothis for you.  It can take one animation, make a certain color"clear", and overlay it over another animation.  I do not have a wayright now to convert .AVI or .MPG files to animator files.  Animatorwill also import a series of .GIF files to create an animation, so ifyour video capture stuff can create this is might work.-Vance Gloster gloster@inference.com

JPEG is designed for compressing eitherfull-color or gray-scale digital images of "natural", real-world scenes.It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or linedrawings.JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does ithandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those typesof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEGrespectively.JPEG is "lossy", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn'tquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves muchof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notablythe fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small detailsof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that willbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, thesmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they areinvisible to the eye.A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied byadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can tradeoff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* smallfiles if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing imagearchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if youaren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, youcan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.[2]  Why use JPEG?There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files acrossnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference indisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, thesize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have toconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Evenwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG imagethan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, usingJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order tostore or transmit an image more cheaply.It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, thetime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than theextra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenetposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you haveonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantageto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete asblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailedin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images amongpeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerablymore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the firstthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color orgray-scale images of "realistic" scenes; that means scanned photographs andsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit displayhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixelsthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeedby GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does withoutintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but theyshould be avoided in JPEG files.)JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixelsadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend tocome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, thissort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairlyoften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness isparticularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall betweenscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex andsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scaleimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale imagesof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether youshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, onlyapplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start froma GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEGcan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justifyconverting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Beprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will notconvert well.[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I havehandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first threefiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEGsoftware described in section 6B.File   Size in bytesCommentsship.ppm1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)ship.ppm.Z 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note. Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.ship.gif 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif Most of the savings is the result of losing color info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)ship.jpg95 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting) This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original, at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.ship.jpg75  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting) You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this from the original, even with both on-screen at once.ship.jpg50  38406  cjpeg -Q 50 This has slight defects; if you know what to look for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing the original.  Still as good image quality as many recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.ship.jpg25  25192  cjpeg -Q 25 JPEG's characteristic "blockiness" becomes apparent at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some). Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were of poorer image quality than this.ship.jpg5o   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead) Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY: the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smallerthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as theGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typicalratio for real-world scenes.[5]  What are good "quality" settings for JPEG?Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff byselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion aboutthe meaning of these settings.  "Quality 95" does NOT mean "keep 95% of theinformation", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;it's not a percentage of anything.The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable fromthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from oneobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  Thissetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in atypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except forexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce afile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able togo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, youmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and areprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 isabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as "op art".(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEGsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  OtherJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely differentquality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just"high"/"medium"/"low"-style choices.)[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article "How to find sources".(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in thesame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you canget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources" in the body.  The "Anonymous FTPList FAQ" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq inthe news.answers archive.NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couplemonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.[6A]  If you are looking for "canned" software, viewers, etc:The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on onekind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check outthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that thislist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain overInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.X Windows:John Bradley's free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG,GIF, and other image formats.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.eduor ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called 'xv-???.tar.Z' (where ??? is theversion number, currently 2.21); it is located in the 'contrib' directory onexport or the 'pub/xv' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bitsinternally, which means it's not a real good choice if you have a 24-bitdisplay (you'll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn't use XV toconvert full-color images to JPEG, because they'll get color-quantized first.But XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.CAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to checkthe "save at normal size" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file willbe blurry.Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  TheImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormappeddisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or thebasic free JPEG software.Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simpleimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latestrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,file contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the currentxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The nextxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available fromexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are saidto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.MS-DOS:This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.The current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basicviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface isnot flashy, but it's functional.Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  Thecurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTEbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPUand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows andOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are nobigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fiton the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that itslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is abit tricky; read the directions carefully!A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier toinstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface isalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but alittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger thanscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and bothare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available fromSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zipor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-inVESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complainsthat the driver is missing.)A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking aroundthe net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortlyand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latestrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality ispoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see agood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 andmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of theseviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programsto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If youhave hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try tofind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the rightthing with hi-color displays.)The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (orjpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOScompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they willconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; inparticular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The majoradvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietaryJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-formatfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it fromSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it isnot readable on non-PC platforms.Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulationpackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSIformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 andmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programsis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this documentrefers to directory (eg) "msdos/graphics" at Simtel20, that really means"pd1:<msdos.graphics>".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you shouldexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are severalInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USAmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 filesin (eg) "/pub/msdos/graphics".  If you have no FTP capability, you canretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings incomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.Microsoft Windows:There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversionprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frillsviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while itdecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out thedecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEGfiles, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other usefulfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it'san excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available fromftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment andslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirrorsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,which is roughly 25% faster.)ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promisingcontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point ithas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, thecurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, filepub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version willbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screenmode, not in a window.OS/2:The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderatoris not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4./pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip    Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip    PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.Macintosh:Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part ofthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be runningSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also installthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can getQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster andconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, isnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 fordetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing imagesthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also canconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a bigimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 andQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best colorimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView canview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it'sthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on atypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it downto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most otherviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some peoplelike this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is verywell thought out.GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF andPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latestversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, butit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversioncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot ofplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter canload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet ifyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, tryconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, isavailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIFconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using thisprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, andGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixiefrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it'sreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it producesrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is anunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does notintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, calledPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trashit, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a muchcleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note thatPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, butit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it onolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can'tuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of adownloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If youdon't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although notall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEGplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloadedJPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.Amiga:(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive atamiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of thisarchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a goodchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being ageneral image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can readseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo versionis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), fileamiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images largerthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, evencapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  Thecurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirrorsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory issupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run underAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), fileamiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packagesthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, andImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both aredistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulationsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is anotherwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas fromamiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, fileAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, manybased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanksto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, withoutso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are "AugJPEG", "NewAmyJPEG","VJPEG", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk spaceit's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.Atari ST:The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.I have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris,but surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.Acorn Archimedes:!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and viewJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handleJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can befound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available byregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/writefunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other imageformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but notnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.Portable software for almost any system:If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the freeJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have adisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targaor PPM 24-bit image files.There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up everyday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you findthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whetherthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it canhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases arenot and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the IndependentJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,documentation, and some small test files is available from several places.The "official" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current releaseis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget toretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you mayprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTEabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available onCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearestcomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQarticle "How to find sources", referred to at the top of section 6.)The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG "JFIF" format and imagefiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in otherprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we havetested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement inproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as withanything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like tocontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, thecomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representativecolors.  This process is called "color quantization".  (This is somethingof a misnomer, "color selection" would be a better term.  We're stuck withthe standard usage though.)Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for mostimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impacton the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except atthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for displayon 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, whatcomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a littledifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probablycome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets "smeared"into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required todisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the imagesource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk aboutthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to countthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give youdifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally seeposted images described as "256-color JPEG".  This tells me that the poster(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), butnumber of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in itspalette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that thesender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender'squantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors thanwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorerimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantizationalgorithm, you're out of luck.For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image qualityfor all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's displayhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of futureimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research inthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEGimages you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what wassent.It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rathershoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGAdisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than youneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two colorquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it'salso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to usehigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and innormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to bedisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the averageGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit displayhardware already: 15-bit "hi-color" PC displays, true 24-bit displays onworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is alreadyobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of theirdisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing imagesin a machine-independent fashion.[8]  How does JPEG work?The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosinetransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropycoding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say morethan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help inusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.[9]  What about lossless JPEG?There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee diddefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees thefinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, thislossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEGalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very fewimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.Saying "-Q 100" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficientquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in thecolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say"-sample 1x1" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercialJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEGalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors invarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixelvalue; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhapshalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEGprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guaranteesbit-for-bit accuracy.If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with lessthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into theJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEGlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with aHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee wasprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the internationalstandards organizations.Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree ona common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence ofofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to"do their own thing", and as a result their programs aren't compatible withanybody else's.The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some workthat's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have definedtwo JPEG-based file formats:  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a "low-end" format that transports    pixels and not much else.  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is    a "high-end" format that will let you record just about everything you    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the    mix will do anything to improve this situation.Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendorsof JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercialproducts will adhere to one or both standards.I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF inpicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; theTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is stillunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is welldefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported "lowest commondenominator"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTimesoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrappedinside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF andQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs areavailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editorthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIFby hand; see section 11 for details.Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF andImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIFformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed byHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not beused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (Thisapplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIFformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-formatfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likelyto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tellwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a    "raw JPEG" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---    it's worth a try, anyway.3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),    try stripping off everything before that.In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is"begin" lineM_]C_X ...whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with"begin" lineM:'-I ...If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble ofdownloading non-JFIF files.[12]  What about arithmetic coding?The JPEG spec defines two different "back end" modules for the final outputof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usuallyproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic codingproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All thefile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by theJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licensesfrom these companies.  (The "fair use" doctrine allows people to implementand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubiousat best.)At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry aboutarithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify thepotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in thefuture.  Stay tuned for further details.[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you coulddecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress itwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an alteredimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost thefirst time around.The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompressit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get anidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the currentfree JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundofferror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventuallydegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generationoutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error canbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be thatcompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the originalquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changesas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, butthat's a mighty limited capability!)The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage andtransmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediateformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you areready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lotof compression/decompression time this way :-).[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if youconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the originalfull-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG fromthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimumloss of quality.The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, tomake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher qualitysetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained insection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colorsdon't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable qualitywill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the bestcandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offerthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don'texpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those createddirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may haveto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-throughJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-colorborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms ofstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharpborder boundary can create visible artifacts ("ghost" edges).  Do yourselfa favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windowssystem, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painlessway to do this.)cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, butfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoidimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higherQ setting may not be necessary.)Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually "dithered" to foolyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often ofsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixelstogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  Thetrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequencycolor noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEGfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would havegotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).To get around this, you want to "smooth" the GIF image before compression.Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color thatyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapidcolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing willoften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size ofthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output imagethan you'd get without smoothing.With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothingcapability is built in.  Try "-smooth 10" or so when converting GIFs.Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handeddithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regularfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strongsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blurthe output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processingwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such aspnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother isa LOT faster than pnmconvol...The upshot of all this is that "cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10" is probably agood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about theimage, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.---------------------For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software inparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.-- tom laneorganizer, Independent JPEG GroupInternet: tgl@cs.cmu.eduBITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie

These objects range from human figures to airplanes,  from semi-trucks to lampposts.  These objects are all freely  distributable, and most have READMEs that describe them.  In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format, a file  with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the  objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially  on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to/from various  object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?), OFF, NFF,  Rayshade 4.0, or vort. Source included for Amiga/Unix as executables  for the Amiga. Also outputs Framemaker MIF files and isometric views  in Postscript.P3D---  From Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. The P3D uses lisp with slight  extensions to store three-dimensional models. A simple lisp  interpreter is included with the P3D release, so there is no need to  have access to any vendor's lisp to run this software.  The mouse-driven user interfaces for Motif, Open Look, and Silicon  Graphics GL, and the DrawP3D subroutine library for generating P3D  without ever looking at the underlying Lisp.  The P3D software currently supports nine renderers.  They are:  Painter - Painter's Algorithm, Dore, Silicon Graphics Inc. GL language,  Generic Phigs, Sun Phigs+, DEC Phigs+, Rayshade, ART ray tracer (from  VORT package) and Pixar RenderMan.

I have noticedmy and my associates progression from hackers to computer professionals.It is rather distasteful.  It occurs when a series of things happen:   1) one's ego outgrows one's talent/knowledge   2) one's financial situation takes precedence   3) A change in priorities (esp. family) possibly leading to 2)   4) the hacker's attitude makes the shift from "fun" to "work"   5) one's vocation burns away the creativity needed for "the hobby"or the biggest killer (IMO)   6) one's dreams are (sadly) shattered on the hard rocks of society's      version of reality.  Without the dream the motivation dies, without      the motivation the effort seems useless.Another set of problems stems from our children.  While most of us rememberwhen there were several completely different computer systems, our childrenare growing up with just a few choices (MSDOS/Mac/Amiga) and do not enjoythe diversity we did.  I remember the great computer fallout of the earlyeighties vividly as I was forced to stop using skills developed for systemsthat were now dead.  The diversity of systems before then allowed for widelydivergent paradigms.  That period forced hackers to continually learn newsystems in the attempt to keep up.  Not to mention that if a program wasneeded we were forced (in most situations) to write it ourselves as acommercial offering was just not available.  Now our children are beingtaught the "user" mentality.  As the number of us "old-timers" dwindle we arenot being replaced by the next generation.Kendall.--    Kendall Sears                           krsear02@ulkyvx.louisville.edu   Programmer                             ///   Child Development Unit                /// Amiga   Department of Pediatrics          \\\\\\/// Currently running AmigaOS 3.0   University of Louisville           \\XX/ And Supporting Unix Sys V Rev 4.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Life is a game you play once.

One is a C program that will perform a "morph" betweenany two points given the amount of frames for the morph. And thenit will write the points, and the function (translate, rotate, etc.) outto a file. Then I have a Perl script that will read the list of functionsand insert them into a .pov file at a given line. I had hoped this wouldlet me do simple animation. However, I have discovered that simplyperforming incremental rotations on an object will not spin a stationaryobject but will actually rotate the object about the axis. Now I knowan easy way around this would be to first translate the object to theorigin perform the rotation and then move it back but I know there must be another way around this. I had thought perhaps it was becauseI had created objects at the origin and then translated them to a newpoint and then done the rotation, which could cause this behavior. Howeverthis occurs on objects that are not translated at all. Any help is appreciated.ttknock@bbs.santafe.edu

Users may download         the BibTeX files via FTP and peruse them offline, or telnet to        "siggraph.org" and log in as "biblio" and interactively search        the database for entries of interest, by keyword.        For the people without Internet access, there's also an e-mail        server. Send mail to        archive-server@siggraph.org        and in the subject or the body of the message include the message  send        followed by the topic and subtopic you wish. A good place to start is        with the command             send index        which will give you an up-to-date list of available information.        Additions/corrections/suggestions may be directed to the admin,        "bibadmin@siggraph.org".Image Manipulation Libraries:-----------------------------Utah Raster Toolkit - nice image manipulation tools.PBMPLUS - a great package for image conversion and manipulation.LIBTIFF - library for reading/writing TIFF images.ImageMagick - X11 package for display and interactive manipulationof images.  Uses its own format (MIFF), and includes some converters.xv - X-based image display, manipulation, and format converter.xloadimage, xli - displays various formats on an X11 screen.Khoros - a huge, excellent system for image processing, with a visualprogramming interface and much much more.  Uses X windows.FBM - another set of image manipulation tools, somewhat old now.Img - image manipulation, displays on X11 screen, a bit old now.xflick - Plays .FLI animation under X11XAnim - plays any resolution FLI along with GIF's(including GIF89a animationextensions), DL's and Amiga IFF animations(3,5,J,l) and IFFpictures(including HAM,EHB and color cycling)SDSC - SDSC Image Tools package (San Diego Supercomputing Center)for image manipulation and conversionCLRpaint - A 24-bit paint program for SGI 24bit workstations and 8bit Indigos.Libraries with code for graphics:---------------------------------Graphics Gems I,II,III - code from the ever so useful books.spline-patch.tar.Z - spline patch ray intersection routines by Sean Graveskaleido - Computation and 3D Display of Uniform Polyhedra.

There is an XView version called xvgr forSuns. Collectively, these 2 tools are known as ACE/gr. Compiling xmgr requires the Motif toolkit version 1.1 and X11R4 - xmgr will not compile under X11R3/Motif 1.0x.  X11R5+Motif 1.2 should work fine, but I've not been able to test this.For a summary of xmgr's capabilities, get the file BLURB fromeither site mentioned below.Available via anonymous ftp to either:ftp.ccalmr.ogi.edu:/CCALMR/pub/acegr/xmgr-2.10.tar.Zorexport.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/acegr/xmgr-2.10.tar.ZPlease remember to set the transfer type to binary.I am not able to E-mail xmgr, but there are services provided by various Internet sites that allow ftp by mail. You might try sending mail to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com as follows:Subject: (hit return) Body-of-letter: help (return) quitI've not tried this, but it should give you instructions on how to use this service.2.10 has been compiled and tested on: IBM RS6000 - AIX 3.2 X11R4/Motif 1.1 DECstation - Ultrix 4.2a X11R4/Motif 1.1 SGI Indigo - Irix 4.0.1 X11R4/Motif 1.1 Sun SPARC  - SunOS 4.1.1 X11R4/Motif 1.1 HP 720     - HP-UX 8.05 X11R4/Motif 1.1Compiling with gcc should be no problem, but use settings appropriate for K&R C.Of interest:In light of recent announcements (COSE), I'm suspending further development of the XView version. For those without Motif on SUNs, I'll provide a compiled binary (eventually).I've begun re-writing ACE/gr in C++, the initial target isMS-Windows.Improvements/fixes from 2.09 are: * The explicit placement of items in popups has been replacedwith manager widgets. The previous method led to problemson some servers (all widgets in a popup would get scrunchedinto the upper left corner). * Many set operations can now be done in the File/Status popup. * The PostScript driver should do a better job of producingEPSF'able output.A few things remain to do (I could use some ideas/help on these):1. Replace the Hershey fonts used for on-screen text with thexvertext routines posted to the net by Alan Richardson.The problem here is how to include support for this in theuser interface.2. Add support for Adobe Font Metrics. I could use some PD or freelydistributable routines for this.3. Add support for pattern fills in the PostScript driver. Presentlythe only way to get hardcopy for fills is to import MIF intoFrameMaker. Need PS routines for pattern fills.4. Add support for HDF/NetCDF. I'm interested in your opinion onhow one would write a generic reader for these file formats.--PaulPaul J Turner - pturner@amb4.ccalmr.ogi.eduCenter for Coastal and Land-Margin ResearchOregon Graduate InstituteBeaverton, OR 97006-1999

The 24 bit image is quantised down to 8bits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour. Thiscolour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways. You then want to apply thesemodifications back to the 24 bit file, so you have to find which colours mappedto this one palette colour. Ok you could do this by copying the 24 bit file to a32 bit file and using the extra 8 bits to hold the index entry. Having done this, you need to do something to them ... what, exactly?Apply the difference in RGB between the original and modified palette entry toeach colour in the group? This could generate colours with RGB outside the range0...255. It would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smoothcolour gradient mapped to several different palette entries.You could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending howfar each colour was from the palette entry. However I suspect this would lookrather odd.So in summary, what I said in my previous posting still holds:>>How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How>>would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? Only global>>changes could be done unless the software were very different and>>much more complicated.>>If you want to do colour editing on a 24 bit image, you need much>>more powerfull software - which is readily available commercially.In other words, to edit a 24 bit file you need software built for the job.Tacking mods onto xv is going to create more problems than it solves.As to the other bits - you seemed to be claiming that there were bugs in XV. Ifthat was not what you meant, then:>(You propably misunderstood what I wrote as you have done in many>places so far.)Yes, I probably did. I found that the collected digest format of your postingmade it a little difficult to understand precisely what your point was. Sorryif I misunderstood.>You also missed what is (were) wrong with XV.

She's no artist, so she intends touse comercial clipart and customise it a bit by drawing a circle or a boxaround it etc.  We have MSPublisher for manipulating text, but it is not suitable for doingmuch with graphics, so she needs a more specialised tool. Right now she'slooking at Corel Draw and Harvard Draw. There seem to be more books in thestores on Corel than on Harvard, so she's inclined to go with Corel on thebasis of popularity. Can anyone give us an informed opinion on which package would be more suitable or if there is an even better alternativeavailable? If this is a FAQ, please withhold the flames and just send thelocation of the FAQ document. Thanks. Three PS's: 1) Is it ok to use clip art from Harvard Draw or whatever for commercial   purposes? 2) We have a 600 dpi Laser Jet 4 printer.

Brown Associates.------Denali bears a strong resemblance to Evans and Sutherlands Freedom graphicssubsystem in several aspects of its high-level design.  Both products usea parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations.  Bothhave a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array ofpixel processors.  As a result, Denali and Freedome overlap significantlyin performance and functionality.  Both design teams also appear to have similar philosophies with respect to modularity, scalability, and marketpenetration.There remain, however, several important differences between the KPC andE&S products.  Evans and Sutherland designed Freedom as a high-enddeveloper's dream system with plenty of performance potential andflexibility.  In its favor, Freedom has configurations from two tosixteen floating point units, a border range that starts and ends ata higher price and performance levels than Denali.  All Freedomsystems include a large, fixed number of pixel processors thatsupport a broader variety of color blending functions.  The Freedomdesign treats its entire image memory as general-purpose memory, allowingdevelopers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special-purposeapplications.  Finally, E&S provided Freedom with very flexible otput andvideo integration features for multimedia and simulation applications.  Notethat KPC is working an auxiliary board for NTSC and PAL output that will notrequire an external video encoder.  E&S programmable output features,however, will remain much more flexible.The KPC design team, in contrast, made Denali more of an end-user's system.Entry version have better performance range and flexibility than low-endFreedom configurations, and come in at more realistic mainstream pricepoints.  Denali does not need as many 29050 modules as Freedome becauseit uses a deeper scan-conversion pipeline to support each one, resultingin better cost/performance characteristics.  Although both products providestrong support for 3D, imaging, and volume rendering, KPC recognized thatnot all users will want an even mix of these capabilities.  Denali'sconfiguration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchasegeometric and pixel processing capabilities separately, and to upgradethem separately as needed.Both companies have implemented hardware texture mapping atworkstation price levels as a way to attack SGI's more expensiveVGXT and RealityEngine systems -- the only other products to providethis capability.  KPC supports point sampling and bilinear interpolationof textures in hardware, but provides only software support for the higherqualtiy tri-linear interpolated mipmapping method.  On balance, however, Denaliprovideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than E&S for most applications.Aside from being much more affordable, KPC solutions deliver more parallelismfor texture processing and more off-screen memory for general graphicsdata storage.  By implementing texture mapping on its transformationmodules, E&S foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levelsto obtain better texturing performance.  Kubota avoids this problem by linkingtexturing to its Frame Buffer Modules, providing a lower-cost, more scalablesolution.Hope this helps,BrianPS This was reprinted without permission.

(1/3.4)    D = S  S  c  K  W    : crater diameter in km g  p  f  n       (1/6)    S = (g /g )    : gravity correction factor for bodies other than     g  e  t      Earth, where g = 9.8 m/s^2 and gis the surface    e      t      gravity of the target body. This scaling is      cited for lunar craters and may hold true for      other bodies.(1/3.4)    S = (p / p )    : correction factor for target density p  ,     p  a   t    t      p  = 1.8 g/cm^3 for alluvium at the Jangle U       a      crater site, p = 2.6 g/cm^3 for average      rock on the continental shields.    C    : crater collapse factor, 1 for craters <= 3 km      in diameter, 1.3 for larger craters (on Earth).    (1/3.4)    K    : .074 km / (kT TNT equivalent)     n      empirically determined from the Jangle U      nuclear test crater.      3   2       19    W = pi * d* delta * V  / (12 * 4.185 * 10  )    : projectile kinetic energy in kT TNT equivalent      given diameter d, velocity v, and projectile      density delta in CGS units. delta of around 3      g/cm^3 is fairly good for an asteroid.    An RMS velocity of V = 20 km/sec may be used for Earth-crossing    asteroids.    Under these assumptions, the body which created the Barringer Meteor    Crater in Arizona (1.13 km diameter) would have been about 40 meters in    diameter.    More generally, one can use (after Gehrels, 1985):    Asteroid    Number of objects  Impact probability  Impact energy    diameter (km)       (impacts/year)   (* 5*10^20 ergs)     10    10     10^-810^9      1 1 000     10^-610^6      0.1       100 000     10^-410^3    assuming simple scaling laws. Note that 5*10^20 ergs = 13 000 tons TNT    equivalent, or the energy released by the Hiroshima A-bomb.    References:    Gehrels, T. 1985 Asteroids and comets. _Physics Today_ 38, 32-41.

The latter was written with    simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind    (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).    More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John    Snyder's USGS publication "Map Projections--A Working Manual", USGS    Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32    projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both    spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It's a    neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one's $20.    You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,    "An Album of Map Projections", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This    contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are    in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.    You can order these 2 ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from USGS:    Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey, 507 National    Center, Reston, VA 22092. (800)-USA-MAPS. They can quote you a price and    tell you where to send your money. Expect a 6-8 week turnaround time.    A much faster way (about 1 week) is through Timely Discount Topos,    (303)-469-5022, 9769 W. 119th Drive, Suite 9, Broomfield, CO 80021. Call    them and tell them what you want. They'll quote a price, you send a    check, and then they go to USGS Customer Service Counter and pick it up    for you. Add about a $3-4 service charge, plus shipping.    A (perhaps more accessible) mapping article is:R. Miller and F. Reddy, "Mapping the World in Pascal",Byte V12 #14, December 1987Contains Turbo Pascal procedures for five common map projections. Ademo program, CARTOG.PAS, and a small (6,000 point) coastline datais available on CompuServe, GEnie, and many BBSs.    Some references for spherical trignometry are:_Spherical Astronomy_, W.M.

SKY (UNIX EPHEMERIS PROGRAM)    The 6th Edition of the Unix operating system came with several software    systems not distributed because of older media capacity limitations.    Included were an ephmeris, a satellite track, and speech synthesis    software. The ephmeris, sky(6), is available within AT&T and to sites    possessing a Unix source code license. The program is regarded as Unix    source code. Sky is <0.5MB. Send proof of source code license toE.

Convert parallax into distance using the    formula in part 6 of the FAQ, convert RA and declination to coordinates    on a unit sphere (see some of the references on planetary positions and    spherical trignometry earlier in this section for details on this), and    scale this by the distance.    Two databases useful for this purpose are the Yale Bright Star catalog    (sources listed in FAQ section 3) or "The Catalogue of Stars within 25    parsecs of the Sun" (in pub/SPACE/FAQ/stars.data and stars.doc on    ames.arc.nasa.gov).NEXT: FAQ #5/15 - References on specific areas
