The user interface to a SUIT program is editable even whilethe application runs.  Programs using SUIT are written in ANSI-C.  SUITruns on UNIX/X, Color Macintosh, DOS, and Windows ; a single applicationsource file may be recompiled to run on all platforms.SUIT was designed to be easy to learn - we view it as "the Pascal of UItoolkits."  Learning from a 10-page written tutorial, our undergraduateshave been able to use SUIT productively after 2 hours.  This is possiblebecause we rely more heavily on interactive tools than previous toolkits,and because the entire system as been designed to be easy to learn.SUIT's biggest advantages are:- it runs across a very wide variety of hardware platforms- it has a documented 2 hour learning curve for beginners- it's very lightweight; relatively small amount of codeSUIT has now been distributed to thousands of sites, and has reachedall continents but Antarctica. It has also been used in graduatecourses at some universities, including Stanford.The suit-users mailing list now has nearly 100 participants and hasmessage traffic of 10-15 per day. Some users have unsubcribed already,citing the volume of mail as the main reason. We feel that thisjustifies a newsgroup.Details of the newsgroup------------------------comp.windows.suit will be an unmoderated forum that will handle allaspects of SUIT, including:- questions about SUIT- bug reports- distribution of contributory code- announcement of new releasesVoting------Voting will begin when this CFV is posted, and will end on May 14, 1993at 23:59 EST.

I was alsoshocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills byabout 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  This seems huge, but is only1/256 of the dynamic range.  In those terms it doesn't seem so bad.  Whatis happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, duemainly to roundoff, I believe.  So the polygon is not planar in z, but ismore like a Ruffles potato chip.  Ditto with lines.  When you start/end atdifferent x/y values, the "ridges" are out of phase, resulting in thestitch effect.  You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygonright on top of another, but with different vertices.  You will likely seea smeared effect where they overlap.  Example:  Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)      Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)Your implementation is correct.  In fact, we do a similar trick whenrendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaceswith isoparametric lines.  Without the trick, the lines appear stitched, asyou say.  When the application draws lines/polygons independently, thesystem does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so theapplication must do it.  This is what you have discovered and are doing.Bravo!(Note to IBM'ers:  The information given here has been previously disclosedthrough proper channels so I'm not giving away any new unpublished info.)--   Mark Einkauf     [ einkauf@austin.ibm.com ]  IBM - Advanced Workstations and Systems - Graphics Systems  Austin TX * Views and opinions expressed herein are not necessarily those of IBM Corp. *

There is an XView version called xvgr forSuns. Collectively, these 2 tools are known as ACE/gr. Compiling xmgr requires the Motif toolkit version 1.1 and X11R4 - xmgr will not compile under X11R3/Motif 1.0x.  X11R5+Motif 1.2 should work fine, but I've not been able to test this.For a summary of xmgr's capabilities, get the file BLURB fromeither site mentioned below.Available via anonymous ftp to either:ftp.ccalmr.ogi.edu:/CCALMR/pub/acegr/xmgr-2.10.tar.Zorexport.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/acegr/xmgr-2.10.tar.ZPlease remember to set the transfer type to binary.I am not able to E-mail xmgr, but there are services provided by various Internet sites that allow ftp by mail. You might try sending mail to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com as follows:Subject: (hit return) Body-of-letter: help (return) quitI've not tried this, but it should give you instructions on how to use this service.2.10 has been compiled and tested on: IBM RS6000 - AIX 3.2 X11R4/Motif 1.1 DECstation - Ultrix 4.2a X11R4/Motif 1.1 SGI Indigo - Irix 4.0.1 X11R4/Motif 1.1 Sun SPARC  - SunOS 4.1.1 X11R4/Motif 1.1 HP 720     - HP-UX 8.05 X11R4/Motif 1.1Compiling with gcc should be no problem, but use settings appropriate for K&R C.Of interest:In light of recent announcements (COSE), I'm suspending further development of the XView version. For those without Motif on SUNs, I'll provide a compiled binary (eventually).I've begun re-writing ACE/gr in C++, the initial target isMS-Windows.Improvements/fixes from 2.09 are: * The explicit placement of items in popups has been replacedwith manager widgets. The previous method led to problemson some servers (all widgets in a popup would get scrunchedinto the upper left corner). * Many set operations can now be done in the File/Status popup. * The PostScript driver should do a better job of producingEPSF'able output.A few things remain to do (I could use some ideas/help on these):1. Replace the Hershey fonts used for on-screen text with thexvertext routines posted to the net by Alan Richardson.The problem here is how to include support for this in theuser interface.2. Add support for Adobe Font Metrics. I could use some PD or freelydistributable routines for this.3. Add support for pattern fills in the PostScript driver. Presentlythe only way to get hardcopy for fills is to import MIF intoFrameMaker. Need PS routines for pattern fills.4. Add support for HDF/NetCDF.

We also know something about VR from ABC news magazine and|> Computer Graphics World magazine.Unfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effectsfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computergraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Eachframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render onhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphicswould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 framesper second).|> |> We certainly want to know more about VR.  Who are the leading|> companies,|> agencies, universities?  What machines support VR (i.e. SGI, Sun4,|> HP-9000, BIM-6000, etc.)?It depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.True immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visualdatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  Thisis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilottraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping ofthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motionof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics systemmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complexdata representations.Additionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15frames per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhapsdue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what wasvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (thegraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constantframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in generaldoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified theUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-timeoperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. Uniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-timeoperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, noteven SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only ourmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation dueto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.From a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environmentsrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-timemulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systemson the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2systems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularlyimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is anunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.|>  What kind of graphics languages are used with VR|> (GL, opengl, Phigs, PEX, GKS, etc.)?You can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to developVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

I triedusing the following code:unsigned int w,h;XQueryBestCursor(XtDisplay(programArea), XtWindow(programArea), 72, 71, &w,&h);to return the nearest size to what I require however it returns 72 and 71 asthe width and height respectively. What am I doing wrong? and if not how can Iget round the problem!!Thanks in advanceMike

She was veryhelpful. We provided some input as to what we'd like to see in the nextversion of DevGuide. Tali was very enthusiatic about our comments. I mentionedI was going to post this email message and she offered to receive additionalcomments from the net on what DevGuide should evolve into.   Send your comments/wish-list, raving, et. al. about DevGuide to:  Tali.Aben@Sun.COM Pretty cool example of a company that cares what we want.... More of thisand computers may have a future. Frankly, I like the idea that it will offer some migration capabilityto DOE/DOMF through an integrated ToolTalk capability, pointed out in March's SunExpert magazine.  Technology works, we can crankout the interfaces with DevGuide. Price is outstanding.

It is the "X Window System", or "X11", or "X" or any ofa number of other designations accepted by the X Consortium.  In fact,doing "man X" on pretty much any X11 machine will tell you:     The X Consortium requests that the following names  be  used     when referring to this software:                                  X                           X Window System                             X Version 11                     X Window System, Version 11                                 X11There is no such thing as "X Windows" or "X Window", despite the repeatedmisuse of the forms by the trade rags.  This probably tells you somethingabout how much to trust the trade rags -- if they can't even get the NAMEof the window system right, why should one trust anything else they have to say?With regard to dialup X11 implementations, there are several.  You canbuy serial X11 terminals from a couple of companies, including both GraphOn and NCD.  (In fact, I'm composing this from an NCD running X11over serial lines across 14.4 kbaud connection.)  NCD also sells a software-only package that provides XRemote (which isNCD's implementation of serial X11) for PC's.  There may be other such software packages available.X11R6 is supposed to include a standardized compression scheme for runningX11 over low-speed connections.  It's called Low Bandwidth X (LBX), and is based on improved versions of the techniques used in NCD's XRemote. It seems likely that once LBX is released as a Consortium standard, therewill be several vendors willing to supply implementations for various sorts of hardware.Followups directed to comp.windows.x-- Matt LandauWaiting for a flash of enlightenment matt@centerline.com  in all this blood and thunder

It allows compositemultimedia objects to be built from media objects.Specifically, it adds audio and video objects to the classes availablein InterViews 3.0.1/3.1, and it does so without changing thesource code for the original classes (though several configurationfiles for InterViews need to be changed via a patch file).  Currently, the Xavier audio classes are only supported on SUNworkstations with an audio interface, such as the SPARCstation2.Xavier has been tested in the following environments:SUN:  Machine : SPARCserver470 SPARCstation-IPC  OS      : SUN-OS4.1.1 or later  C++     : SUN C++ ver2.1NEC(EWS):  Machine : EWS4800/210,230  OS      : EWS-UX/V(Rel4.0) WSOS41 Release5.1,Release5.2  C++     : C++ Release3.1It can be obtained via anonymous ftp from          interviews.stanford.edu in /pub/contrib/          (Xavier.large-demo.tar, and Xavier.tar)We are preparing a mailing-list for information regarding Xavier.If you are interested, please contact                                  xavier@tsl.cl.nec.co.jp.

Does anyone know anything aboutthis problem........- I am using an XmTextField, and setting its XmNvalue to a hardcoded  text string (ascii or Kanji) either via XtSetValues or XmTextSetString.  The problem is that when the XmTextField is displayed, the text is getting  truncated, depending on the setting of the environment variables  LANG (more specifically LC_ALL).  When they are set to japanese,  the text gets truncated.  When they are set to english, everything  works fine.  I am taking the default for XmNcolumns.  (Please note that hardcoding of text is NOT done in my actual   application, just in my sample code to make things easier)- I am running Motif 1.2, X11R5 via HPUX9.01.  My test program is set up  to handle 16 bit Kanji characters.  I have remembered to do     XtSetLanguageProc() prior to my MrmInitialize and my font resources  are set to japanese fonts.- Don't know if this matters, but my dialog box and TextField is initially  created with UIL. The problem does NOT happen with XmText.  Unfortunately substitutingXmTextFields with XmTexts in my application is not an acceptablealternative (way too much code to be modified while in beta!)I have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyonewants it.  My best guess is that either the X code or Motif is notproperly allocating memory for japanese, but since I don't have thesource to look at it is just a guess.Please let me know if this sounds familiar, or if you have a suggestion,or if you want the sample program.THANKS!!!!!!!!- Susan   swalker@bbn.com  617-873-8190

This is running XRemote overa serial line.I wanted to get some measurement of response time, so I wrote a small Xlibprogram which simply creates a window, maps it and sends the first Expose event to itself. The program times the delay from sending the event, to receiving it.  I thought this was the simplest way to test client/X-server round-trip delays. It's a similar concept to the ping(8C) program.Is this a valid test to perform ? I've also tried the xbench program, availablefrom ftp.uu.net, which bombards the server with graphics operations, but I just wanted to get a quantative measure of what is "acceptable" interactive response time.

A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new itemto be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() (or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the newitem in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles"regular" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take careof rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a "proper" wayto do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window isguaranteed to be mapped.The problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the windowis already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow "tickle" theWindow so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enableit to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item.What is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior?

The PASCAL is to be replaced by C/C++ I think next year - I learn't this (and X Windows programming as well)anyway via a good selection of project over the final three months - dependingon your tastes, the selection of skills learn't can be quite wide reaching.The one critiscism I would level at the course, which I would have thoughtinvaluable, is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry -this would probably need a slightly longer project period (say six months), butwould enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thoroughcourse.Yes, I know this sounds like a plug for the course, why not!Mackem Ian.

Most of the C preprocessors that        I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the        line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the        start of a directive.         However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol        as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines        that "This" is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my        imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better        fix.(2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular        use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp        gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK.If you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, I would appreciateinformation about on your solutions.  (Perhaps, this is solved in a laterversion of imake that I have not reviewed.)  Also, do you know of other cpp'sthat behave similarly?Since I do not have easy access to News, a response to'white_billy@po.gis.prc.com' would be appreciated.

I guess for DOS users whothink multi-tasking is really _neat_ (add puke here) and are overjoyed to be able to use more than 64K of memory, its a major improvement. For Windowsusers its more like an upgrade with facilities most Unix users take for granted. Most of  Windows users only use PCs for text processing or running 3rd-party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even a real issue. My ideal operating system:Binary compatible across all plaforms. It should recognizebinaries and configure on the fly, so I don't have to havebin/Mac bin/DOS bin/Dec bin/Sun bin/HP etc...Multi-CPU. So I can use the CPUs on my PC and W/S and Mac and Transputers and DSPs. I don't know a single site which has gone for a single vendor. I am not going to trade-in 80Mflops per H1 transputer or ultra-fast FFT on DSP chips.Note NT runs on Symmetric multi-CPU systems.Built-in portable GUI/Graphics tools. You can call DrawButton or DrawLine and it does the same thing no matter what platform or display. It should also translate graphics commands on-the-fly.so I can use PC graphics S/W on my workstation and X software on  my PC. I think GUIs are not just nice to have but essential.Configurable front-end. So you can make it look like Unix or DOSor NT or OS/2, and run shell scripts or command/BAT files.Object oriented. So I can program easily under it and not haveto re-invent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratchor my application needs to access source/object code on the fly.In other words it should have some AI capability. That and a tight, cleankernel so you can actually understand it.

With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete, I'vefinally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView.I put together a quick test, and I've found that XPutImage()is considerably slower (factor of 2 on average?) than theSunview command pw_rop() which moves image data from memorypixrects to a canvas. This was on a Sparc IPX. It seems that:(1) the X protocol communication is slowing things down; or(2) XPutImage is inefficient...or both! My question is, whatis the fastest way in X11R5 to dump 8 plane image data toa window? Can I take advantage of the fact that the client isrunning on the same machine as the server? Or am I stuck withXPutImage() (in which case I might as well give up now...)?All help appreciated...thanks!Derek-----------------------------------------------------------| Derek C.

They place the title at that position   and the window at a position below it.   This becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current   configuration and restore is later.   Currently, my solution is:   XCreateWindow(...);   XSetWMProperties(..);   XMapWindow(...);   XFlush(...);   XMoveWindow(...);   It works with olwm, but is less than elegant. All this leaves me wondering   if I'm overlooking something obvious.   Richard.I know that the mwm has an resource to specify if positions are to be used forthe border of a window or for the "user" window. Maybe other window managershave similar options.Another way to figure out the difference between the "user" window positionand the window manager decoration window position is to subtract theirpositions. You just have to use XQueryTree and remember that the window managerdecorations window is the parent of your window. Unfortunately, you can onlyfigure out the decoration width and height after the window has been mappedthis way.Greeting,          Tobias (bading@cs.tu-berlin.de)

(Command-line flag is -ghbnie.)  o Explicitly pop down all dialog boxes when document view   window is closed, for window managers too dull to do so   themselves.  o Better visited anchor color for non-SGI's.  o Added .hqx and .uu to list of file extensions handled like .tar files.  o Added 'Clear' button to Open box, to allow more convenient   cut-n-paste entries of URL's.  o New resource 'autoPlaceWindows'; if set to False, new document   view windows will not be automatically positioned by the   program itself (but it's still up to your window manager just how   they're placed).  o Command-line flags -i and -iconic now have desired effect (new   resource initialWindowIconic can also be used).  o Gif-reading code is a little more bulletproof.  o Obscure infinite loop triggered by extra space in IMG tag fixed.  o Eliminated nonintuitive error message when image can't be read   (inlined NCSA bitmap is indication enough that something's not   right for authors, and readers can't do anything about bad images   in any case).  o Obscure parsing bug (for constructs like <ADDRESS><A   HREF=...>text<A></ADDRESS>) fixed.  o Fixed mysterious stupid coredump that only hits Suns.  o Fixed stupid coredump on URL's like '://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/'.  o Fixed buglet in handling rlogin URL's.  o New support for Solaris/SYSVR4 (courtesy   dana@thumper.bellcore.com).  o Better support for HP-UX 8.x and 9.x (courtesy   johns@hpwarf.wal.hp.com).  o Better support for NeXT (courtesy scott@shrug.dur.ac.uk).  o Some miscellaneous portability fixes (courtesy   bingle@cs.purdue.edu).  o Miscellaneous bug fixes and cleanups.

It seems areasonable behavior since when a dialog is popped up from a keyboardaction, the dialog is not guaranteed to be under the pointer and theuser should not have to reach for the mouse just to move the focus.Alternatively, I'm open to any suggestions as to what is the "right"way to insure that popups get the focus when they appear, particularlywhen they are invoked from the keyboard and one's keyboard focuspolicy is pointer.Allen Barnett(whose wife graciously allowed to use her account)

Hence, this command will set the window & icon title:         echo "\\033]0;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\\007\\c"     To set just the icon title:         echo "\\033]1;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\\007\\c"     To set just the window title:         echo "\\033]2;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\\007\\c"     Of course, you may have to fiddle with exact syntax,    depending on how the echo command works on your system    and what shell you are using (I've shown System-V semantics    under Bourne or Korn shells).    [Hint for Sun OS users:  use /usr/5bin/echo instead of    /bin/echo or Csh's built-in echo.

ICS sells the widgets for variousprices.  There are also some public domain widgets in the delivery. The ICS Widget databook is a subscription kind of thing, where you pay some nominal fee, get a cd with the widgets and then you can use the public domain widgets freely, and selectively activate widgets which you want to purchase the right to use from them. The nice thing about this is that you can purchase whole sets of widgetssuch as those used in dataviews.  I dont know there pricing schemesbut It is often better to buy than to redevelop the more complex widgets, especially if you only one customer to distribute to. This is the extent that I know about them except that I got their databook catalog  and it looked impressive (lots o' widgets there)I dont work for ICS or have any widgets being sold by them.hope this helps you.-- Brian Dealy                |301-572-8267| It not knowing where it's at  dealy@kong.gsfc.nasa.gov   |            | that's important,it's knowing!uunet!dftsrv!kong!dealy   |            | where it's not at...

If you don't do this, the>cursor will be hard to track when in motion.You allways could port and use emu from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/emu.tar.Z.We've implemented a blinking text cursor for the very reasons people mentioned.You can even configure the actual size of the text cursor (horizontal / ver-tical line cursors, smaller block cursors), turn on and off blinking,set the blink rate and so on. You even get blinking text - ok, enoughadvertising.I haven't looked at the xterm code in this respect, but from the memoriesI have when we had to decide whether to start with xterm and make it dowhat we wanted (mostly the blinking text), I'd say it won't be easy, sincexterm is a hairy mess (understandable if you follow it's roots back toX10).The actual task to get the cursor to blink isn't that difficult if youprovide the right hooks. As Antonio mentioned, you'll have to show thecursor directly after it has moved, or people will become confused.Since it's a good idea to take the cursor off the screen when you do anything on screen anyways, this isn't very complicated. You'll justhave to start the blink process with the cursor showing directly afterit's mapped.As for the portability of emu and it's newest version. The one on exportis still the same as on the R5 contrib tape. We wanted to get out a newrelease for over six months now, but unfortunately we're drowning in work.But since the changes aren't affectiong emu's behavior much, I'd saywhoever wants to try emu shouldn't wait for a new version.As is, emu won't work on BSD derived systems (e.g. SUNs) with anything else than a csh. There is a fix to this, which is very short (remove one lineof code).

Thefollowing code illustrates the problem:#include <stdio.h>#include <X11/Xlib.h>#include <X11/Xutil.h>main(){        Display *display;        Window win;        XVisualInfo vinfo;        Colormap colormap;        XSetWindowAttributes attributes;        XEvent event;        Status status;        display=XOpenDisplay(NULL);        status=XMatchVisualInfo(display,DefaultScreen(display),24,TrueColor,                &vinfo);        if (!status){                fprintf(stderr,"Visual not found\\n");                exit(1);        }        colormap=XCreateColormap(display,DefaultRootWindow(display),                vinfo.visual,AllocNone);        attributes.colormap=colormap;        win=XCreateWindow(display,DefaultRootWindow(display),0,0,100,100,                0,24,InputOutput,vinfo.visual,CWColormap,&attributes);        XMapWindow(display,win);        for (;;){                XNextEvent(display,&event);        }}I tried this with an SGI with 24 plane TrueColor server, and with an HP9000-700 24 plane DirectColor server (with the obviously neccessary change),both running X11R4. On the client side, I have tried with X11R4 Xlib onHP 9000-700 and DECstation, and with X11R3 Xlib on DECstation. All thecombinations gave BadMatch error on the CreateWindow request.As far as I can tell from the manual, the only attribute which may givea BadMatch, is the colormap, if it belongs to a wrong visual. But thevisual was correctly matched, as I did not get the error message. Whatam I doing wrong? For information I can tell that xwud aborts with thesame error.

I'm using InterViews,but that may not matter, this seems to be a generic problem in X.For example, I use OpenWindows on a Sparc2, with point-to-focusset, and that generally works, but not always, depending on whatwas going on in some window when I move the cursor from one shelltool window to another.  Or so it seems...My question, then, is what can I do within X to guarantee point-to-focus within my application?  Thanks for any response.Dave

There was the possibility thatit was going to be changed so that if the file wasn't DSC compliant that itwould stop at each showpage.  I believe that this method would preclude beingable to go backwards and forwards through the file, i.e., you could only goforward to the next showpage.

I heard|>    this was done using some application, but I don't recall what it was.xv -root -max -quit whatever-image-file--+-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+| o |                \\\\\\-  Brain Inside -///                       | o || o |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                           | o || o | Andre' Beck (ABPSoft) mehl: Andre.Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de | o |+-o-+--------------------------------------------------------------+-o-+

SinceX    1984, this contest demonstrated that a program that mearly worksX    correctly is not sufficient.  The IOCCC has also done much to addX    the arcane word 'obfuscated' back into the English language.X    (see "The New Hacker's Dictionary" by Eric Raymond)X X    You are strongly encouraged to read the new contest rules beforeX    sending any entries.  The rules, and sometimes the contest EmailX    address itself, change over time.  A valid entry one year mayX    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules.  The typicalX    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally notX    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical X    closing date for contests are in early May.X X    The contest rules are posted to comp.unix.wizards, comp.lang.c,X    misc.misc, alt.sources and comp.sources.d.

The reasoningis supposedly to better meet long range personnel requirements.  This isevidenced by the large number of CS people who are employed via contractsand are not brought on board except in special circumstances.  This isa generalization which obviously doesn't always hold true, but there arestatistics.  Furthermore, most "software engineering" at Ford gets doneby electrical engineers.

However, this digitiser makes use of the serialport, so there would seem to be a need to have a special device driver.The HP manual pages say that the HP X server will accept X input fromdevices listed in the /usr/lib/X11/X*devices file (* = display number).I shouldn't think I would be able to simply insert /dev/rs232c as an inputdevice in this file and expect a digitiser to work.  But maybe I'm wrong.  Am I?What I would like to know is: does anybody out there have a digitiser connectedto their workstation for use as a pointer for X (rather than just as input to aspecific X application)?  If so, what were the steps required for installation?Did you need a special device driver?  Did the manufacturer supply it?  Arethere generic public domain device drivers around?  (I understand thatdigitisers generally use only a couple of standard formats.)Any help would be greatly appreciated.Cheers- Vaughan-- Vaughan Clarkson                  ___________    Email: vaughan@ewd.dsto.gov.auEngineering Ph.D. Student              |                  Phone: +61-8-259-6486& Glider Pilot       ^                    Fax: +61-8-259-5254     ---------------------------------(_)---------------------------------

However, cpp is only invoked by xrdb, andnot when the resources are loaded on demand.Is there a proper solution to this?So far, the only proper solution I've come to think of, is to create 2different files in my ~/app-defaults/, say XTerm and XTerm-color, andset my XFILESEARCHPATH to either $HOME/%T/%N or $HOME/%T/%N-color.But that does not always seem to work (e.g. executing a remote shellcommand without reading the .cshrc does not set XFILESEARCHPATH).Furthermore, I thought of using #include "XTerm" in XTerm-color.However, for resources in XTerm that I want to override in XTerm-color,things are different on both machines. On a Sun, the FIRST found resourceis used (i.e. the one from XTerm, the b&w one), while on an RS/6000, theLAST found value is used (i.e. the one from XTerm-color). What can I doabout it?I have one last question: for the specification of XFILESEARCHPATH, Ican use %T, %N, %C and %S. %T stands for app-defaults, %N for theresource class, but what do %C and %S stand for?Thanks in advance for replying,Marcel.--  X   drs.

I am using X11R4 and Motif 1.1 currently, although I will also be working with Open Look in the future.     What I need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the user from switching from one window of the application to another window.  Let's say, for example, that Window A is on top of Window B in the window hierarchy.  Normally, if the user clicks the mouse in Window B it will be brought to the top of the window hierarchy and placed on top of Window A.  Under certain circumstances if the user clicks the mouse in Window B I need to beep and prevent Window B from being raised on top of Window A.      From the research and testing I've done so far, it appears that this window ordering is handled by the window manager, in this case Motif.  I haven't found any way to override this default processing through standard X Window functions.  I can tell when this switching occurs through focus change and mapping notify events, but I can't find any way to tell Motif not to make the switch.      The temporary solution I've currently come up with is very kludgy but it partially works.  When I detect such a window switch in those cases when the switch is not allowed, I manually force the formerly top window back on top with an XRaiseWindow call and beep with the XBell function.  This provides the necessary functionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places twice.      Does anyone know how I can tell Motif (or preferably *any* window manager) when I don't want the window order switch to actually take place?  Respond either by e-mail or posting to this newsgroup.Cheers....

You can generally tell the differencejust by using it.  If the cursor blinks a lot when there's screen activity,it's probably a software cursor.  If it has a hardware cursor, I think you'reprobably battling a bug in HP's X server.  I'm not familiar with any hardwarecursor chips that display cursors greater than 64x64.  It's quite possiblethat the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actuallychecking it.  I vaguely recall that very old MIT server revisions did just that.In reality you're probably stuck with a 64x64 maximum size cursor regardlessof what the server returns.-joel

Read on......---------------------------------------------------------Bristol Technology is proud to announce version 3.0 ofits popular HyperHelp product and version 2.0 of Xprinter.    HyperHelp 3.0    -------------HyperHelp is the de-facto standard for on-line contextsensitive help in the Unix marketplace.  Through a oneline function call, application developers can access thefull features of HyperHelp and cut down drastically ontheir development time.  HyperHelp can use the same RTF,project, and bitmap files as the MS Windows Help facility.This allows a documentation department to maintain a singleset of help documents portable between MS Windows, Motif andOpen Look.  HyperHelp can also be authored in FrameMaker. And with HyperHelp 3.0 Bristol introduces its SGML compiler!New features in HyperHelp 3.0 include secondary windows,a characterbased viewer, segmented bitmaps, SGML support, and an improved Historywindow.     Xprinter 2.0     ------------Xprinter 2.0 allows developers to add sophisticatedprinter support to their existing/new X based applicationsvery easily.  Xprinter uses the Xlib API for both thedisplay and printer.  This lets you use the exact same codefor drawing and printing.  Take a look at the source code forour demo and see Xprinter in action.If you are interested in adding PostScript and PCL5 supportto your application, Xprinter is the tool for you!  Earlierthis year Bristola dn USL signed an agreement thatresulted in Xprinter becoming the standard printing technologyfor UNIX SVR4.2.Feel free to run the demo and let us know what you think aboutHyperHelp and Xprinter.

I'm accessing the xconfigurestructure, like the X11 manual says.  (xev->xconfigure.x, xev->xconfigure.y).The width and height memebers are correct.When I reposition the window, using the window manager, the xevent's xconfigurestructure contains all the correct x, y, width, height member settings.Q1: Anybody know why, when just resizing, the x and y are being set to zero?Q2: Any other way to handle detecting and saving geometry changes?I've tried using XtGetValues() on the topLevel widget when exiting myapplication (before destroying any widgets) and all I get is garbage valuesfor the x, y, width, height resources.Thanks--Bob Ross (ross@li.loral.com)         | "Mr. Plow, that's the name.

Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget andthe application, Xt cannot guarantee the order of execution.In general, the callback procedures should be thought of as operating independently of one another and should not depend on side-effects of othercallbacks operating; if a seqence is needed, then the single callback to be registered can explicitly call other functions necessary.[4/92; thanks to converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 122)  Why doesn't XtDestroyWidget() actually destroy the widget?XtDestroyWidget() operates in two passes, in order to avoid leavingdangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget, which is not actually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop. ----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 123)  How do I query the user synchronously using Xt?It is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback,which has a clear flow of control. The calls to AskUser() block until answeris set to one of the valid values. If it is not a "yes" answer, the code dropsout of the callback and back to an event-processing loop: void quit(Widget w, XtPointer client, XtPointer call){int             answer;answer = AskUser(w, "Really Quit?");if (RET_YES == answer){answer = AskUser(w, "Are You Really Positive?");if (RET_YES == answer)exit(0);                }}A more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether to overwrite it.This is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop andwaiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to thecalling function. That function AskUser() looks something like this, where the Motif can be replaced with widget-set-specific code to create some sort of dialog-box displaying the question string and buttons for "OK", "Cancel" and "Help" or equivalents:  int AskUser(w, string)        Widget          w;        char           *string;  {        int             answer=RET_NONE;/* some not-used marker */        Widget          dialog;/* could cache&carry, but ...*/        Arg             args[3];        int             n = 0;        XtAppContext    context;        n=0;        XtSetArg(args[n], XmNmessageString, XmStringCreateLtoR(string,                XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET)); n++;        XtSetArg(args[n], XmNdialogStyle, XmDIALOG_APPLICATION_MODAL); n++;        dialog = XmCreateQuestionDialog(XtParent(w), string, args, n);        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNokCallback, response, &answer);        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNcancelCallback, response, &answer);        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNhelpCallback, response, &answer);        XtManageChild(dialog);        context = XtWidgetToApplicationContext (w);        while (answer == RET_NONE || XtAppPending(context)) {                XtAppProcessEvent (context, XtIMAll);        }        XtDestroyWidget(dialog);  /* blow away the dialog box and shell */        return answer;  }The dialog supports three buttons, which are set to call the same function when tickled by the user.  The variable answer is set when the user finally selects one of those choices:  void response(w, client, call)        Widget          w;        XtPointer client;        XtPointer call;  {  int *answer = (int *) client;  XmAnyCallbackStruct *reason = (XmAnyCallbackStruct *) call;        switch (reason->reason) {        case XmCR_OK:                *answer = RET_YES;/* some #define value */                break;        case XmCR_CANCEL:                *answer = RET_NO; break;        case XmCR_HELP:                *answer = RET_HELP;                break;        default:                return;        }}and the code unwraps back to the point at which an answer was needed andcontinues from there.[Thanks to Dan Heller (argv@sun.com); further code is in Dan's R3/contribWidgetWrap library. 2/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 124)  How do I determine the name of an existing widget?I have a widget ID and need to know what the name of that widget is.Users of R4 and later are best off using the XtName() function, which will work on both widgets and non-widget objects.If you are still using R3, you can use this simple bit of code to do what you want. Note that it depends on the widget's internal data structures and is not necessarily portable to future versions of Xt, including R4.#include <X11/CoreP.h>#include <X11/Xresource.h>String XtName (widget)Widget widget;/* WILL work with non-widget objects */{return XrmNameToString(widget->core.xrm_name);}[7/90; modified with suggestion by Larry Rogers (larry@boris.webo.dg.com) 9/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 125)  Why do I get a BadDrawable error drawing to XtWindow(widget)?I'm doing this in order to get a window into which I can do Xlib graphicswithin my Xt-based program:> canvas = XtCreateManagedWidget ( ...,widgetClass,...) /* drawing area */> ...> window = XtWindow(canvas);/* get the window associated with the widget */> ...> XDrawLine (...,window,...);/* produces error */The window associated with the widget is created as a part of the realization of the widget.  Using a window id of NULL ("no window") could create the error that you describe.  It is necessary to call XtRealizeWidget() before attempting to use the window associated with a widget. Note that the window will be created after the XtRealizeWidget() call, but that the server may not have actually mapped it yet, so you should also wait for an Expose event on the window before drawing into it.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 126)  Why do I get a BadMatch error when calling XGetImage?The BadMatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of the screen. If you don't want to catch the error and deal with it, you can takethe following steps to avoid the error:1) Make a pixmap the same size as the rectangle you want to capture.2) Clear the pixmap to background using XFillRectangle.3) Use XCopyArea to copy the window to the pixmap.4) If you get a NoExpose event, the copy was clean. Use XGetImage to grab theimage from the pixmap.5) If you get one or more GraphicsExpose events, the copy wasn't clean, and the x/y/width/height members of the GraphicsExpose event structures tell you the parts of the pixmap which aren't good.6) Get rid of the pixmap; it probably takes a lot of memory.[10/92; thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com)]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 127)  How can my application tell if it is being run under X?A number of programs offer X modes but otherwise run in a straightcharacter-only mode. The easiest way for an application to determine that it isrunning on an X display is to attempt to open a connection to the X server:display = XOpenDisplay(display_name);if (display){ do X stuff }else{ do curses or something else }where display_name is either the string specified on the command-line following-display, by convention, or otherwise is (char*)NULL [in which case XOpenDisplay uses the value of $DISPLAY, if set].This is superior to simply checking for the existence a -display command-line argument or checking for $DISPLAY set in the environment, neither of which is adequate. [5/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 128)  How do I make a "busy cursor" while my application is computing?Is it necessary to call XDefineCursor() for every window in my application?The easiest thing to do is to create a single InputOnly window that is as large as the largest possible screen; make it a child of your toplevel window and it will be clipped to that window, so it won't affect any other application. (It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the user enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual desktop.) Substitute "toplevel" with your top-most widget here (similar code should work for Xlib-only applications; just use your top Window):     unsigned long valuemask;     XSetWindowAttributes attributes;     /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */     valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor;     attributes.do_not_propagate_mask =  (KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask |         ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask);     attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor(XtDisplay(toplevel), XC_watch);     /* The window will be as big as the display screen, and clipped by        its own parent window, so we never have to worry about resizing */     XCreateWindow(XtDisplay(toplevel), XtWindow(toplevel), 0, 0,         65535, 65535, (unsigned int) 0, 0, InputOnly,         CopyFromParent, valuemask, &attributes);where the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen,particularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than32767.When you want to use this busy cursor, map and raise this window; to go back tonormal, unmap it. This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouseevents; depending on precisely how the window manager works, it may or may nothave a similar effect on keystrokes as well.In addition, note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor resource which can be temporarily reset, should you merely wish to change thecursor without blocking pointer events.[thanks to Andrew Wason (aw@cellar.bae.bellcore.com), Dan Heller (argv@sun.com), and mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu; 11/90,5/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 129)  How do I fork without hanging my parent X program?An X-based application which spawns off other Unix processes which continue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its children are terminated; the children inherit from the parent the open X connection to the display. What you need to do is fork; then, immediately, in the child process, close (ConnectionNumber(XtDisplay(widget)));to close the file-descriptor in the display information. After this do your exec. You will then be able to exit the parent.Alternatively, before exec'ing make this call, which causes the file descriptor to be closed on exec.(void) fcntl(ConnectionNumber(XDisplay), F_SETFD, 1);[Thanks to Janet Anstett (anstettj@tramp.Colorado.EDU), Gordon Freedman (gjf00@duts.ccc.amdahl.com); 2/91. Greg Holmberg (holmberg@frame.com), 3/93.]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 130)  Can I make Xt or Xlib calls from a signal handler?No. Xlib and Xt have no mutual exclusion for protecting critical sections. If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which might be while the function you are calling is already executing), it can leavethe library in an inconsistent state. Note that the ANSI C standard pointsout that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler callsany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific toXlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may becalled safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.You can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupthandler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event whichhas previously been added.Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly Volume 6 are in error.[Thanks to Pete Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) and Donna Converse (converse@expo.lcs.mit.EDU), 5/92]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 131)  What are these "Xlib sequence lost" errors?You may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error handler, or, more likely, if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or Xlib from a signal handler, which you shouldn't be doing in any case. ----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 132)  How can my Xt program handle socket, pipe, or file input?It's very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input both from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor, but which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or the other file descriptor.A solution is use XtAppAddInput(). After you open your file descriptor,use XtAppAddInput() to register an input handler. The input handler will be called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your program's attention. Write the input handler like you would any other Xt callback, so it does its work quickly and returns.  It is important to use onlynon-blocking I/O system calls in your input handlers.Most input handlers read the file descriptor, although you can have an input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish.Be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file.You will find that the function is called even when there isn't input pending.XtAppAddInput() is actually working as it is supposed to. The input handler is called whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read, not only when there isnew data to be read. A disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always ready to be read, however, if only because you can spin back to the beginningand read data you've read before.  The result is that your function will almostalways be called every time around XtAppMainLoop(). There is a way to get the type of interaction you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your function to test whether there is new data:     if (ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, &n) == -1 || n == 0) return;But, because this is called frequently, your application is effectively in a busy-wait; you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput() and instead setting a timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input.[courtesy Dan Heller (argv@ora.com), 8/90; mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu 5/91;Ollie Jones (oj@pictel.com) 6/92]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 133)  How do I simulate a button press/release event for a widget?You can do this using XSendEvent(); it's likely that you're not settingthe window field in the event, which Xt needs in order to match to the widgetwhich should receive the event. If you're sending events to your own application, then you can use XtDispatchEvent() instead. This is more efficient than XSendEvent() in that youavoid a round-trip to the server.Depending on how well the widget was written, you may be able to callits action procedures in order to get the effects you want.[courtesy Mark A.

However, the window is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen --until your application receives an Expose event. Drawing done before that will generally not appear. You'll see code like this in many programs; this code would appear after window was created and mapped:  while (!done)    {      XNextEvent(the_display,&the_event);      switch (the_event.type) {case Expose: /* On expose events, redraw */XDrawLine(the_display,the_window,the_GC,5,5,100,100);break;...}    }Note that there is a second problem: some Xlib implementations don't set up the default graphics context to have correct foreground/background colors, so this program could previously include this code:  ...  the_GC_values.foreground=BlackPixel(the_display,the_screen);/* e.g. */  the_GC_values.background=WhitePixel(the_display,the_screen);/* e.g. */  the_GC = XCreateGC(the_display,the_window,                GCForeground|GCBackground,&the_GC_values);  ... Note: the code uses BlackPixel and WhitePixel to avoid assuming that 1 is black and 0 is white or vice-versa.  The relationship between pixels 0 and 1 and the colors black and white is implementation-dependent.  They may be reversed, or they may not even correspond to black and white at all.Also note that actually using BlackPixel and WhitePixel is usually the wrong thing to do in a finished program, as it ignores the user's preference for foreground and background.And also note that you can run into the same situation in an Xt-based programif you draw into the XtWindow(w) right after it has been realized; it maynot yet have appeared.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 135)  What is the difference between a Screen and a screen?The 'Screen' is an Xlib structure which includes the information aboutone of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single X display supports. A server can support several independent screens. They are numbered unix:0.0,unix:0.1, unix:0.2, etc; the 'screen' or 'screen_number' is the second digit --the 0, 1, 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available Screens on this particular Display connection.The macros which you can use to obtain information about the particularScreen on which your application is running typically have two forms -- onewhich takes a Screen and one with takes both the Display and the screen_number.In Xt-based programs, you typically use XtScreen(widget) to determine the Screen on which your application is running, if it uses a single screen.(Part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macroswhich return characteristics of the Screen have "Display" in the names -- XDisplayWidth, XDisplayHeight, etc.)----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 136)  Can I use C++ with X11?

The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap,set it to be the background pixmap of a window, and then free the pixmap. The window keeps this background, but the pixmap itself is destroyed.  If you're sure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap), you can use XClearArea() to clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage() to read back that pixel.  However, this action alters the contents of the window, and it suffers from race conditions with exposures. [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]Note that the same applies to the border pixel/pixmap. This is a (mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate thepixel/pixmap however it wants.  By not requiring the server to keep the original pixel or pixmap, some (potentially a lot of) space can be saved. [courtesy Jim Fulton, MIT X Consortium]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 139)  How do I create a transparent window?A completely transparent window is easy to get -- use an InputOnlywindow. In order to create a window which is *mostly* transparent, you haveseveral choices:- the SHAPE extension first released with X11R4 offers an easy way tomake non-rectangular windows, so you can set the shape of the window to fit theareas where the window should be nontransparent; however, not all servers support the extension.- a machine-specific method of implementing transparent windows forparticular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware.  Note that there is no X notion of a "transparent color index".- a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny windows, but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult.- a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparentwindow or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your applicationwindow with information; if so, you can draw into separate bitplanes in colorsthat will appear properly.[thanks to der Mouse, mouse@lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU, 3/92; see alsoThe X Journal 1:4 for a more complete answer, including code samples for thislast option]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 140)  Why doesn't GXxor produce mathematically-correct color values?When using GXxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on abackground of black, for example, should produce white. However, the drawingoperation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices. The color thatthe resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visuallyrandom unless you have actually filled it in yourself. [On many X servers Blackand White often 0/1 or 1/0; programs taking advantage of this mathematicalcoincidence will break.]If you want to be combining colors with GXxor, then you should be allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosenpre-computed values.If you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors, then you can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC (graphics context) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over red, say, the result is blue, and when it draws over blue the result is red. This foreground value is itself the XOR of the colormap indices of red and blue.[Thanks to Chris Flatters (cflatter@zia.aoc.nrao.EDU) and Ken Whaley (whaley@spectre.pa.dec.com), 2/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 141)  Why does every color I allocate show up as black?Make sure you're using 16 bits and not 8.  The red, green, and blue fields of an XColor structure are scaled so that 0 is nothing and 65535 is full-blast. If you forget to scale (using, for example, 0-255 for each color) the XAllocColor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is usually black.

XGetRGBColormap() when used with the property XA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAP does not create a standard colormap -- it just returns one if one already exists.Use xstdcmap or do what it does in order to create the standard colormap first.[1/91; from der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu)]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 143)  Why does the pixmap I copy to the screen show up as garbage? The initial contents of pixmaps are undefined.  This means that mostservers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there -- which is usually garbage.  You probably want to clear the pixmap first usingXFillRectangle() with a function of GXcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever color you want as your background (or 0L if you are using the pixmap as a mask).

I want to check whetherthe window exists before doing anything with it.Because X is asynchronous, there isn't a guarantee that the window would still exist between the time that you got the ID and the time you sent anevent to the window or otherwise manipulated it. What you should do is send theevent without checking, but install an error handler to catch any BadWindow errors, which would indicate that the window no longer exists. This scheme willwork except on the [rare] occasion that the original window has been destroyed and its ID reallocated to another window.[courtesy Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 4/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 145)  Can I have two applications draw to the same window?Yes. The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources (actually,the server assigns some bits, the client others), and any application that knows the ID can manipulate the resource [almost any X server resource, exceptfor GCs and private color cells, can be shared].The problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple applications. A simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of theapplications' running on different machines) is in the first application to create a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window ID intoit. The second application then retrieves the property, whose name it alsoknows, and then can draw whatever it wants into the window.[Note: this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the firstapplication running, and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentionedin the Question about using window IDs on remote displays.]Note also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level cooperation among your applications. Note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to use the same server connection. If one process is a child of the other, it should close down the connection to the server and open its own connection.[mostly courtesy Phil Karlton (karlton@wpd.sgi.com) 6/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 146)  Why can't my program work with tvtwm or swm?A number of applications, including xwd, xwininfo, and xsetroot, do nothandle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use; they typically return the wrong child of root. A general solution is to add this code or to use it inyour own application where you would normally use RootWindow(dpy,screen):/* Function Name: GetVRoot * Description: Gets the root window, even if it's a virtual root * Arguments: the display and the screen * Returns: the root window for the client */#include <X11/Xatom.h>Window GetVRoot(dpy, scr)Display        *dpy;int             scr;{Window          rootReturn, parentReturn, *children;unsigned int    numChildren;Window          root = RootWindow(dpy, scr);Atom            __SWM_VROOT = None;int             i;  __SWM_VROOT = XInternAtom(dpy, "__SWM_VROOT", False);  XQueryTree(dpy, root, &rootReturn, &parentReturn, &children, &numChildren);  for (i = 0; i < numChildren; i++) {Atom            actual_type;int             actual_format;long            nitems, bytesafter;Window         *newRoot = NULL;if (XGetWindowProperty(dpy, children[i], __SWM_VROOT, 0, 1,    False, XA_WINDOW, &actual_type, &actual_format, &nitems,            &bytesafter, (unsigned char **) &newRoot) == Success && newRoot) {root = *newRoot;break;}}return root;}[courtesy David Elliott (dce@smsc.sony.com). Similar code is in ssetroot, aversion of xsetroot distributed with tvtwm. 2/91]A header file by Andreas Stolcke of ICSI on export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/vroot.h functions similarly by providing macros for RootWindow and DefaultRootWindow;code can include this header file first to run properly in the presence of avirtual desktop.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 147)  How do I keep a window from being resized by the user?Resizing the window is done through the window manager; window managerscan pay attention to the size hints your application places on the window, but there is no guarantee that the window manager will listen. You can try setting the minimum and maximum size hints to your target size and hope for the best. [1/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 148)  How do I keep a window in the foreground at all times?It's rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself[e.g. by tracking VisibilityNotify events] so that it isn't overlapped -- imagine the conflict between two such programs running.  The only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stackis to make the window override-redirect; this means that you are temporarilyassuming window-management duties while the window is up, so you want to do this infrequently and then only for short periods of time (e.g. for popup menus or other short parameter-setting windows).[thanks to der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu); 7/92]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 149)  How do I make text and bitmaps blink in X?There is no easy way.  Unless you're willing to depend on some sort ofextension (as yet non-existent), you have to arrange for the blinking yourself,either by redrawing the contents periodically or, if possible, by playing gameswith the colormap and changing the color of the contents.[Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse), 7/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 150)+ How do I get a double-click in Xlib?Users of Xt have the support of the translation manager to help get notification of double-clicking.There is no good way to get only a double-click in Xlib, because the protocol does not provide enough support to do double-clicks.  You have to do client-side timeouts, unless the single-click action is such that you can deferactually taking it until you next see an event from the server.  Thus, you have to do timeouts, which means system-dependent code.  On most UNIXish implementations, you can use XConnectionNumber to get the file descriptor of the X connection and then use select() or something similar on that.Note that many user-interface references suggest that a double-clickbe used to extend the action indicated by a single-click; if this is the casein your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromisecheck the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it, too, shouldbe the single-click action or the double-click action.[Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse), 4/93]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 151)! How do I render rotated text?Xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics capabilities, leaving them up to server-extensions or clients-side graphicslibraries.Your only choice, if you want to stay within the core X protocol, is torender the text into a pixmap, read it back via XGetImage(), rotate it "by hand" with whatever matrices you want, and put it back to the server via XPutImage(); more specifically:1) create a bitmap B and write your text to it.2) create an XYBitmap image I from B (via XGetImage).3) create an XYBitmap Image I2 big enough to handle the transformation.4) for each x,y in I2, I2(x,y) = I(a,b) where a = x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta)b = x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta)5) render I2Note that you should be careful how you implement this not to losebits; an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better.The high-level server-extensions and graphics packages available for X also permit rendering of rotated text: Display PostScript, PEX, PHiGS, and GKS,although most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use thesame fonts that would be found on a printer.In addition, if you have enough access to the server to install a fonton it, you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at somepredefined angle. Your application can then itself figure out placement of eachglyph.[courtesy der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu), Eric Taylor (etaylor@wilkins.bmc.tmc.edu), and Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 11/90;Liam Quin (lee@sq.com), 12/90]InterViews (C++ UI toolkit, in the X contrib software) has support forrendering rotated fonts in X.  It could be one source of example code.[Brian R. Smith (brsmith@cs.umn.edu), 3/91]Another possibility is to use the Hershey Fonts; they are stroke-rendered and can be used by X by converting them into XDrawLine requests. [eric@pencom.com, 10/91]The xrotfont program by Alan Richardson (mppa3@syma.sussex.ac.uk) (posted to comp.sources.x July 14 1992) paints a rotated font by implementing the method above and by using an outline (Hershey) font.The xvertext package by Alan Richardson (mppa3@syma.sussex.ac.uk) is a set of functions to facilitate the writing of text at any angle.  Version 3.0 was recently released to alt.sources and comp.sources.misc [3/93]; it is also on export as contrib/xvertext.3.0.shar.Z. O'Reilly's X Resource Volume 3 includes information from HP aboutmodifications to the X fonts server which provide for rotated and scaled text.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 152)  What is the X Registry? (How do I reserve names?)There are places in the X Toolkit, in applications, and in the Xprotocol that define and use string names. The context is such that conflictsare possible if different components use the same name for different things.The MIT X Consortium maintains a registry of names in these domains:orgainization names, selection names, selection targets, resource types,application classes, and class extension record types; and several others.The list as of 7/91 is in the directory mit/doc/Registry on the R5 tape; it is also available by sending "send docs registry" to the xstuff mailserver.To register names (first come, first served) or to ask questions send to xregistry@expo.lcs.mit.edu; be sure to include a postal address forconfirmation.[11/90; condensed from Asente/Swick Appendix H]----------------------------------------------------------------------David B.

PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for many systems, small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size and quickness, it has enough power to satisfy most users, including: standard x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent), including a portable metafile format and renderer. The PLPLOT package is freely distributable, but NOT in the public domain. The PLPLOT source code, except header files and those files explicitly granting permission, may not be used in a commercial software package without consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely available, and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed somewhere in the documentation for the package. We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code, especially in the form of user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any published papers, please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work, which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also, please remember that as PLPLOT is not a commercial product, we cannot be expected to offer the kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs, but the principal authors can only afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on those which help us get our work done. PLPLOT is written in C, enabling it to run on many platforms practically without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the header file "plplot.h"; see the documentation for more details. The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of several TeX files; please consult this for additional information ('latex plotdoc').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to the code, so don't be surprised if some known features are not explained there.  Consult 'Changes.log' to see a list of recent changes.   At present, PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems: Unix:SunOS A/IX  HP-UX Unicos DG/UX Ultrix SysV Linux Amiga/Exec MS-DOS OS/2 NeXT For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system, see:  - appendices to the PLPLOT manual  - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory. To become a subscriber to the PLPLOT mailing list, send a request to plplot-request@dino.ph.utexas.edu.

Those currently supporting and otherwise responsible for the package in its present form include: Maurice LeBrun Please send all comments, flames, patches, etc, to me.

There is an XView version called xvgr forSuns. Collectively, these 2 tools are known as ACE/gr. Compiling xmgr requires the Motif toolkit version 1.1 and X11R4 - xmgr will not compile under X11R3/Motif 1.0x.  X11R5+Motif 1.2 should work fine, but I've not been able to test this.For a summary of xmgr's capabilities, get the file BLURB fromeither site mentioned below.Available via anonymous ftp to either:ftp.ccalmr.ogi.edu:/CCALMR/pub/acegr/xmgr-2.10.tar.Zorexport.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/acegr/xmgr-2.10.tar.ZPlease remember to set the transfer type to binary.I am not able to E-mail xmgr, but there are services provided by various Internet sites that allow ftp by mail.

For those without Motif on SUNs, I'll provide a compiled binary (eventually).I've begun re-writing ACE/gr in C++, the initial target isMS-Windows.Improvements/fixes from 2.09 are: * The explicit placement of items in popups has been replacedwith manager widgets. The previous method led to problemson some servers (all widgets in a popup would get scrunchedinto the upper left corner). * Many set operations can now be done in the File/Status popup. * The PostScript driver should do a better job of producingEPSF'able output.A few things remain to do (I could use some ideas/help on these):1. Replace the Hershey fonts used for on-screen text with thexvertext routines posted to the net by Alan Richardson.The problem here is how to include support for this in theuser interface.2. Add support for Adobe Font Metrics. I could use some PD or freelydistributable routines for this.3. Add support for pattern fills in the PostScript driver. Presentlythe only way to get hardcopy for fills is to import MIF intoFrameMaker. Need PS routines for pattern fills.4. Add support for HDF/NetCDF.

I imagine it has something to do with a missingscreen driver, or something along those lines, but figured someone out therein Internet land might be able to help.I am installing it on a machine that already has OpenLook installed, and wouldlike to have both installed concurrently.  Thus, I set it up to compile to my/usr/X11R5 directory.  I worked out all the kinks in getting it compiled (withgcc), so that it compiles without any warnings.  I need it installed for PEX-SI,so I set all those appropriate flags.  When I run it, however, I get a messagealong the lines of:Getting interface configuration : Operation not supported on socketsunOpenFrameBuffer : Inappropriate ioctl for deviceFatal server error : no screens found Any ideas on how I can fix it?

Hear! Hear! I agree completely. One thing I can't stand aboutthe Mac interface is its shear determination to FORCE you to usethe mouse(what if your mouse breaks--your whole system isdown!).  I like the mouse--it is handy on some occassions suchas cut and past and moving icons around, etc.  But for mostwork, the keyboard and hot keys are 10-20 times faster thanusing the mouse. Sure it is a plus to be able to do somethingsimple if you are an inexperienced user, but how long is itbefore your are experienced? A month? Two? (Speaking of PCs atthe moment.)I don't think it is too much to ask that windowprogrammers provide not only a menu/mouse interface but alsolook forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys andcommand line interfaces, which usually allows you to do more inless time IF you are experienced.All of the above equally applies to windowing systems onUNIX (especially since Unix is at least 500% more powerful thanDOS).-- \\---------------------------------------------------------------------/ \\ Seth Buffington U.S.S.

Imake support has been improved, a few defaults havebeen changed, and a lot of other small things have been added.This is basically a release which drops the 'gamma' status. Next release willincorporate some improvements by Stefan Schwarz, and possibly will supportX11R5 and Motif 1.2.x.Note to all of those who keep copies of the archive: please retrieve thisdistribution (during off-peak hours), and delete all previous copies.Here is the original ANNOUNCEMENT:HISTORYThe University of Lowell, supported by a grant of the Open Software Foundation,has developed a wrapper-library, that encapsulates Motif widgets in C++classes. All resources of these Widgets can now be set throughmember-functions, while objects can be used in callback-functions. The librarywas made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 129.63.1.1.However, the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights, and onlyworked under X11R3. Due to lack of subsequent fundings, the bindings are nolonger actively supported by the University of Lowell.I, Ronald van Loon, at a certain point last year, have taken the Lowell bindings, fixing the bugs I came across, adding missing memberfunctions, andenhancing functionality and made the bug-fixed library available for thegeneral public for anonymous ftp (made possible by Rick Murphy at DEC).NEW RELEASEI am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the Motif++bindings. This release offers:- Full Motif1.1 and X11R4 support- Support for Xbae widgetset - Two additional widgets, written by myself, that can be used to indicate  progress in an application.- Imake support. NB: this release relies heavily on the existence of imake     and its config files on your site. I have tried to     provide the bindings with a standard Makefile, tweakable     for those unfortunates without imake. I have not severely     tested the standard Makefile though. Contact me if you     have problems. The reason for calling this a gamma     release lies in the fact that I do not have a multitude     of platforms to test the Imake-files on.- Lots of testfiles (even somewhat useful programs)- An article I wrote on the usage of Motif, X and C++, previously posted  on Usenet.WHERE TO GET THE NEW MOTIF BINDINGSFtp:Anonymous ftp at decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1), directory /pub/X11.Note:Please be patient as the network link is quite slow. Please do not FTP largefiles during working hours.Also note that there is also a motif++.31.jan.92.tar.Z file at this site; thisis an old version of the bindings.E-mail:Those who don't have ftp can send me e-mail, and I will send the bindings bye-mail.REQUESTThose who use the bindings and find bugs, or see room for improvement, pleasecontact me, and I will try to incorporate them in a future release (in case ofbugs, a bug-fix of course ;-). MORE INFORMATION Contact me at "rvloon@cv.ruu.nl".If you are desperate, then you can call me at+31 30 506711 (that is Utrecht, the Netherlands; those within the Netherlandscall 030-506711).Enjoy!-- Ronald van Loon     | In theory, there is no difference (rvloon@cv.ruu.nl)  | between theory and practice.3DCV Group, Utrecht |   The Netherlands     | In practice however, there is.

Whatis really powerful is that it can run the X server withoutrunning a window manager. One can then run a special clientX program called a window manager, either (1) run motif or openlook from it's own firmware (limiting the networktraffic - but having no HOME). or (2) run motif or openlookfrom some home place (like a sparc, or vms).This is powerful, especially since I can exit one window manager(without killing windows) and then start up another manager.(Some of my VMS tools need special meta-mouse combos that work inone manager and not the other).Well the question is:  On a sparcstation running openlook, does anyone know how to  break apart olwm from the olwm_slave program? Basically I  want to run only the server, and go somewhere else to run  the window manager.---Please respond my e-mail (as well as posting) because of thelarge volumes in window.X)Thanks.-- Scott Moody   (206) 773-4313   "There are no answers .. just cross references"     scott@shuksan.boeing.com       uunet!bcstec!shuksan!scott

Is this method likely to give better results than server-| resident pixmaps? I'd also be interested in looking at the XView code| mentioned above...There is no easy answer to this question: it depends on whether the displaydevice can hold pixmaps in off-screen memory, and if so, how efficientlythe server manages these resources (having to deal with limited off-screenmemory is the bane of the server implementor's existence!).  I have worked with graphics devices where the off-screen memory to main display copy rate eclipses that of the main memory to display copyrate, and with those where the main memory to display is *faster* thanoff-screen to display (requires only a write to the framebuffer ratherthan a read of the F.B. followed by a write)If your server uses the cfb code or something like it to render intopixmaps in CPU main memory, the rates you can get through MIT-SHM arelikely to be equal (maybe a tad slower, depending on your OS's implementationof shared memory) to CopyArea from pixmap to window, which is also thenjust a copy from CPU main memory to graphics device.One advanage of MIT-SHM is that if your images are large, you don't end upgrowing the size of the server process to hold them.One disadvantage of the MIT-SHM is that, in its sample implementation,there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segmentsif the client dies a sudden, violent death (e.g., "kill").  You have to be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments.Ken--Kenneth Whaley (408) 748-6347Kubota Pacific Computer, Inc.

The server's view of the world, (obtained via xwd |xwud), seems to be exactly what it should be.  However, the displayedversion of the framebuffer gives the impression that the server isusing scanlines that are too long.  After a bit of experimentation, itseems that the problem was that the server was padding the line out toa word boundry, but the scanline size in the buffer is 90 bytes, whichisn't exactly divisible by four.  Changing the following defines inmit/server/include/servermd.h:----#define BITMAP_SCANLINE_PAD  32#define LOG2_BITMAP_PAD5#define LOG2_BYTES_PER_SCANLINE_PAD2---to:---#define BITMAP_SCANLINE_PAD  16#define LOG2_BITMAP_PAD4#define LOG2_BYTES_PER_SCANLINE_PAD2---Was not exactly the right solution.  How do I tell the server either(a) don't pad the scan lines at all ('cause this server is only beingbuilt to run on this particular display), or to pad only to byteboundries?I'm using a customized version of XFree86v1.2, under Mach 3.0.ThanksBrian

Gealow)Newsgroups: comp.windows.xSubject: Standard ColormapsDate: 27 Apr 1993 13:48:56 GMTOrganization: MIT Microsystems Technology LaboratoriesLines: 49Distribution: worldMessage-ID: <1rjdk8INNcnh@senator-bedfellow.MIT.EDU>NNTP-Posting-Host: mtl.mit.eduI'm working on an X11R5 application and have concerns regarding standard colormaps.The X11R5 documentation says: "Usually, a window manager creates these colormaps."  I wonder what window manager the writer had in mind.  Neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps.Of course, one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps.  However, xstdcmap doesn't seem to try very hard to avoid conflicts with the default colormap.  When I use standard colormaps created by xstdcmap, the rest of my display goes black.  So it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid.  Perhaps if every application used standard colormaps, things would be wonderful.  But not many applications seem to use standard colormaps.Finally, the operation of the functions XmuGetColormapAllocation, XmuStandardColormap, and XmuCreateColormap seem inconsistent with the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation.    According to the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation (p. 436):    For GrayScale colormaps, only the colormap, red_max, red_mult, and     base_pixel members are defined.  The other members are ignored.      To compute a GrayScale pixel value, use the following expression:            (gray * red_mult + base_pixel) &0xFFFFFFFF    XmuGetColormapAllocation, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CmapAlloc.c, is     used by XmuLookupStandardColormap, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/LookupCmap.c    to select red_max, green_max, and blue_max values for the     call to XmuStandardColormap.  When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is     specified, XmuGetColormapAllocation sets red_max to 30% of the     total number of cells in the gray scale, sets green_max to 59%     of the total number, and sets blue_max ot 11% of the total number.    Referring to section 14.3, one would expect XmuGetColormapAllocation     to set red_max to the total number of cells in the gray scale.    When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is specified, XmuStandardColormap,     defined in mit/lib/Xmu/StdCmap.c, sets red_mult, green_mult,     and blue_mult all equal to 1.  Referring to section 14.3,     one would expect green_mult and blue_mult to be ignored.    When red_mult, green_mult, and blue_mult all equal 1,     XmuCreateColormap, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CrCmap.c, constructs     a gray map. The sum of red_max, green_max, and blue_max gives     the maximum gray value.  Referring to section 14.3, on would     expect red_max to give the maximum gray value.

Atutorial will be on Thursday the 24th and the conference proper on the25th with the annual meeting at the dinner on the evening between thetwo days.  All conference attendees are welcome at the annual meeting,though only Consortium members will be able to vote.This year's theme is Application Construction by Non-ProgrammersMuch of the effort on X toolkits has been aimed at programmerconstruction of applications.  There have, however, been some excellentUIMS systems built on top of X.  Papers addressing the theme willconsider questions such asWhat is needed for application construction by non-programmers?Can we avoid programming altogether, or is a simple language needed?Is it sufficient to create applications, or must users be able tocreate new widgets?Should widgets and applications be able to print themselves?Your participation in the conference is welcome.  Papers are appropriateon the theme or any aspect of the Andrew User Interface System, includingapplicationsexperience with usersnew objectsreviews of and proposals for revision of internal Andrew protocolsWe expect to have an RS/6000 with video projector available if you wouldlike to do a demonstration.  Paper proposals should be submitted by 15 May 1993.Acceptance will be 1 June with final papers due by 15 June.Send papers via electronic mail to wjh+@andrew.cmu.edu.Fred HansenDirector, Andrew Consortium

Anyone have any ideas ??  I expect the limiting factor will be your server machine, not the networkitself. To give you a real-world example, here at Quarterdeck we haveroughly 100 people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes, novellfile servers, and each other. It's not _too_ much of a load on ourEthernet (with maybe 4 concentrators, so you have 20-30 people on eachsegment). If you had a badly loaded net, or the apps you wanted to runwere very network intensive, you could run into some slowdowns.But the biggest problem would be the machine itself. Say you have a 48633 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. If you have10 people running programs off it, you're going to see some slowdownsbecause you're now on (effectively) a 3.3 MHz 486. Of course, DVX willattempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their timeslice, but if you have 10 working programs running, you'll know it.Having said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by addingin calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort ofthing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine beforeyou started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth).It all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're goingto see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are alldoing network things also...)--        Quarterdeck Office Systems - Internet Support - Tom Bortels Pricing/Ordering : info@qdeck.com  |  Tech Questions : support@qdeck.com  BBS: (310) 314-3227 * FAX: (310) 314-3217 * Compuserve: GO QUARTERDECK   Q/Fax: (310) 314-3214 from touch-tone phone for Technotes On Demand!

It is designed to be a simple and intuitive programminginterface to access the functionality of commonly used widgets.Xm++ was initially created for the Motif widget set, now support for theAthena widgets was added. Applications created with Xm++ run in bothenvironments without changes, although many nice features are onlyavailable when using Motif.In some situations Xm++ extends the underlying toolkit (i.e. providinga ComboBox borrowed from MS-Windows), but never tries to replace it -data of user interface objects is left to the widgets and only duplicatedin rare cases.Xm++ has nothing common with Motif++ besides the general idea toencapsulate Motif widgets in C++ objects and the '++' in it's name. Manyideas for the Xm++ architecture came from Digitalk's Smalltalk version,which provides an easy to use framework for Windows/PM/Mac applications(in the very first time of development I used the Windows dialog editor anda simple parser to create similar Smalltalk and Xm++ dialogs :-).Top level objects in Xm++:* 'Windows', 'SystemDialogs' and 'ToolBoxes' which use the automatic layout  feature of various composite widgets in Motif and Xaw* 'UserDialogs' which can be individually laid out with a user interface  builder (a first version of such a dialog editor is included in this  distribution)Controls (children of top level objects):'staticText', 'staticImage', 'pushButton', 'checkBox', 'radioButton','edit', 'listBox', 'comboBox', 'groupBox', 'paneArea', 'drawing', 'toolBar'The staticImage and all the button classes can display b/w (X-bitmapformat) or color (GIF format) pictures as an alternative to a label text.Event handling is done by a simple but powerful mechanism which redirectsXt callbacks to member functions of Xm++ objects.CommonInteract(II) is built upon the Xm++ drawing class and providescomponents for building direct manipulative applications. Is is a verysimplified implementation of some features from the CommonInteract system(research project of our institute in 1991), an approach to define asoftware achitecture for implementing direct manipulative applicationswith multiple interaction media (i.e. sound, alternative input devices).If you are interrested, look into the June 1993 issue of the JOOP (SIGSPublications - Journal of Object Oriented Programming) - there should beour paper about CommonInteract (but be aware, that it is our 'state ofthe art' from 1991).CommonInteract(II) is still undocumented and is included because it wasused to implement the dialog editor. It currently supports only drawingprimitives (lines, rectangles, circles...), but we plan to extend it tosupport bitmaps and some controls also.Known problem: the Xm++ drawing class has no redrawing strategy (alwaysredraws the whole window, even after minimal changes like selecting anobject), this looks very ugly on slow displays and should be fixed.About this first release:Xm++ is still incomplete and has a lot of bugs but we are using it herefor smaller applications which are running without problems. So I thinkI can call it a 'beta release' which can be used to develop applicationsfor any non-critical purposes.CommonInteract may be called a 'pre alpha release'. It's development willbe continued this year because we plan to use it for another researchproject here.

Simpler shading models are implemented already, f.i. in x3d (ask archiewhere to get the latest version).For Gouroud, a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extensiononly, either MIT-SHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the windowwith it, or PEX/OpenGL which should be able to shade themselves. The portable'vanilla X' way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage(),what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapesor such stuff.To speak about POVRay, the X previewer that comes with the original sourcepackage is not that good, especially in speed, protocol-friendlyness andICCCM compliance.

I have already recompiled my kernel and the germankeyboard in the textmode works just fine.I have found out, that there is a preconfigured german keymap for Xcalled Xmodmap.gr in /usr/lib/X11, so I ran xmodmap /usr/lib/X11/Xmodmap.gr.My first impression was very good, I was able to get Z and Y straight :)There's still a little problem I can't solve however:I cannot get at the backslash, bar, brackets and curly brackets.The ALT-GR key doesn't seem to work.I tried xev to find out whether it produces an event at all and it does.Looking up its keycode (113) in the Xmodmap I found the entry "Mode_switch"which doesn't ring any bell. The entries for the keys I cannot use seemto be correct. Example: keycode XX = ssharp questn backslashThe first 2 entries I can even get at. The first one is the unmodifiedkey and the second is the key with shift, but what is the 3rd??My guess is that it should be the key with ALT-GR but it isn't.If anybody has run into similar problems and knows how to solve them,help would be appreciated.CUAlaric

By default only the last change can be undone, but a resource is    provided to allow the user to specify how many, including unlimited,    levels of undo information should be kept. Also, undo of undo is    supported.There is no truth in the rumour that the next version will be EmaXe 19 :-)                          -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-For those who have not encountered aXe before here is a summary ofwhat it is all about:aXe is a simple to use text editor for X that represents a significantimprovement over xedit. Also built around the Athena Text Widget itfeatures, amongst other things,   o multiple windows   o multiple buffers   o default menu interface   o optional button interface, with choice and layout of buttons      under user control   o minibuffer for expert use and access to external filters   o provision for defining a keyboard macro   o geometry specification and resizing in terms of characters   o file selection via a browser   o knowledge of line numbers   o parenthesis matching   o regular expression searching   o restricted or unlimited undo   o ability to change font   o easy entry of control codes   o xterm-like keymap feature   o easy runtime setting of selected preferences (resources)   o both brief and comprehensive on-line help   o server mode with cooperating client programs   o optional extension language using Tcl   o optional Xaw3d widget set compatability   o collection of reusable widgets that embody the functionality of aXeI have personally built and run core aXe, i.e. without the Tcl andXaw3d options, on the following systems:   Sun SPARC        SunOS 4.1.x     MIT X11R5   Sun SPARC        SunOS 5.1       MIT X11R5   Encore Multimax  UMAX 4.3        MIT X11R5   DEC 5000/120     ULTRIX 4.2      MIT X11R5   HP 9000/710      HP-UX 8.07      MIT X11R5   MAC IIci         AU/X 3.0        MIT X11R5   but not all have been subject to the same level of testing. I haveonly tested the Tcl and Xaw3d options on the first.A number of '#ifdef SYSV'-isms that have been fed back to me have beenincorporated into the code and a possible scandir replacement isprovided for those systems that do not have one.Although aXe will probably build under R4 run-time problems have beenencountered in the past. I have not bothered to try this version underR4, and have not put any effort into solving previously knownproblems.  Therefore, if you are at R4 you very much take pot luck. Ifit doesn't work the only alternative is to try the last release,2.1.1, of version 2 which should still be around. It doesn't have asmany features and uses the Widget Creation Library (Wcl). Not onlythat, it requires an old version of Wcl, 1.06 or 1.05. Version 3 ofaXe was nearing completion when version 2 of Wcl came out so aXe 2never got converted to make use of it.aXe is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12)and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1) initially, and probably in duecourse from several other ftp sites.

If you have several hundred users who dowhat the books tell them, though, then it's confusing at best.  Another is tohave your xterms run login shells, but that still leaves the window managerand the things that get started from its menus with the wrong environment.Our alternative is that instead of having xdm run the client startup scripts,it runs the user's favourite shell as a login shell, and has *it* then run therest of the startup scripts.  That way the user's usual environment gets setup as normal and inherited by everything.

(To encourage membership, however, we defer universal release of thelatest versions until Consortium members have had an opportunity toexplore the new capabilities.)To se what AUIS looks like, you can try a remote demo.  You need an Xserver (R5 is best) on a machine linked to the internet.  Give thecommand finger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu for instructions.NOTE:  The demo version does not use the Motif-look-and-feel scrollbar,but one is available.  You can use it on the demo by changing an optionin the ~/preferences file and starting a new editor.The Andrew Toolkit component of AUIS is ideal if you want to buildapplications using compound documents.  Andrew's major feature is itsarchitecture for recursive embedding of objects: equation in table infigure in text, for example.  This architecture extends to areas notusually found in toolkits, including file stream formats, cut/paste, andprinting.Andrew also provides some of the most commonly requested applications: word processor, spreadsheet, drawing editor, and font editor (the lattertwo are in version 5.2 which will be generally released on the XR6 tapein December.)Fred HansenDirector, Andrew Consortium

These  are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the  performance of your workstation.  Well, more hardware isn't always an option, and I wonder if more  hardware is always even a necessity.  This "FAQ" list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different  people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X  Windows on your workstation, WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE.  Performance is a highly subjective issue.  The individual user must  balance `speed' versus `features' in order to come to a personal  decision.  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many  subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts.  This document is specifically concerned with X.  There are of course  many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation.  However, they are outside the scope of this document.    [ People seriously interested in the whole area of system    performance, might want to look at the O'Reilly Nutshell Handbook    "System Performance Tuning" by Mike Loukides.  I'm about 25% of the    way through reading it, and it looks like a well-written    comprehensive treatment of system performance.  I'm unaware of any    other similar books.  --ed.]-----------------Table of Contents-----------------  0. Introduction & Administrivia  1. What about the "Other X FAQ"?  2. Window Managers  3.

If you are reading a copy of this FAQ which is more than a few  months old (see the "Last-modified" date above) you should probably  locate the latest edition, since the information may be outdated.  If you do not know how to get those newsgroups and/or your site does  not receive them and/or this article has already expired, you can  retrieve this FAQ from an archive site.  There exist several usenet FAQ archive sites.  To find out more about  them and how to access them, please see the "Introduction to the  news.answers newsgroup" posting in news.answers.  The main FAQ archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].  This document  can be found there in /pub/usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups.  If  you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can retrieve it by  sending a mail message to mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu with the  command "send usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups" in the message body.-----------------------------What about the "Other X FAQ"?-----------------------------  David B. Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and  well written "comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions" document.  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates  on performance.  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4".  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).---------------Window Managers---------------  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this  point, most respondents have agreed upon "twm" as the best candidate  for a speedy window manager.   A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,  is turning off unnecessary things like "zooming" and "opaque move".  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)  I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.------------The X Server------------Which Server?- - - - - - -  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute  to less paging.           [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.  You can expect to get "*very* large speedups in the server" by not  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial  compilers on the market.Locking the Server into RAM?- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help  performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone  who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.    [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com),      Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be),      Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ]Starting your Server- - - - - - - - - - -  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!    Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of  why this works, which I have summarized here:    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself    sorted out before the clients start up.    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources    being fetched, programs initializing state and "databases" and so    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this    initialization is done ("The process has reached a steady state"),    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your    workstation's limited resources  This is most definitely a "Your Mileage May Vary" situation, as there  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients  you are starting, etc.  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &  I've experimented with:(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &  I've even tried:(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down    into a "steady state" before the sleep expired and all my clients    were launched. ]  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.Fonts- - -  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts  your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer  fonts will be loaded by the server.      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13  in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since  I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.About the Resources File- - - - - - - - - - - - -    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)  One suggestion:    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N    [ The "comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions" FAQ contains    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.    --ed.]    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files    with the same name.    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following  benefits:    - Easier to maintain / more usable.    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort       through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.  It also has drawbacks:    - the application that you are interested in has to load an      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to      make that much of a performance difference, and you might      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an      application's resource database, you just need to re-run the      application without having to "xrdb" again.    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*      provide any error message when it encountered the C style      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted      processing the resource file.      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef      COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this      method of resource management.    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my  .Xdefaults file, and to use the "separate resources files" method for  clients that I seldom use.Define Your Display Properly- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to   "<hostname>:0.0", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you  should set your DISPLAY variable to "unix:0.0" or ":0.0".  By doing this  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further  explanation of how to properly set your display name.  "I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when  the DISPLAY isn't set specially."      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.  I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT  will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if  you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]-------Clients-------  If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think  carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there  a smaller clock program than xclock?  Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large  they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients  (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]  I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject  of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif  clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in  more than one toolkit library.  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client  programs would work best together in that environment.  [Thanks to: Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET),      Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk | sinclair@uk.ac.gla.dcs) ]A Better Clock for X- - - - - - - - - - -1) xcuckoo   suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk)   available: on export.lcs.mit.edu   Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.

Extensively configurable.  it can be made to look   very much like MIT oclock, or mostly like xclock purely by changing   resources.  Of course, the ultimate clock --- one that consumes no resources, and   takes up no screen real estate --- is the one that hangs on your wall.  :-) A Better Terminal Emulator for X- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  From the README file distributed with xterm:  +-----  | Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here  |  | This is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution.  | ...  +-----  Ugly maybe, but at my site it's still the most used.  I suspect that  xterm is one of the most used clients at many, if not most sites.  Laziness?  Isn't there a better terminal emulator available?  See below.  If you must use xterm, you can try reducing the number of saveLines  to reduce memory usage.  [ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com),   Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ]1) Xvt   suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) :   available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z   "...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm, then get   hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as   xterm is rather a hog! "   This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.  You don't have to   rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current   version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that   there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any   yet.   UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with   Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He   questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For   instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling   speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap   bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm   may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard   numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text   segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.   As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it   made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets   brought into memory.   So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of   xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary.   If you can provide some hard data, I'd like to see it.

"I also have my own terminal emulator.  Its major lack is   scrollback, but some people like it anyway."Tuning your client- - - - - - - - - -  Suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster.  From Scott Barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding Motif  Text Field Widgets:    I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets, I    was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes,    particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was    going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource    XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget    (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the    widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference    on a [slower system].  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots  of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor  embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server  requests?-------------------------Miscellaneous Suggestions-------------------------Pretty Pictures- - - - - - - -  Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.  - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server    is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)  - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm    conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see    people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.    I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by    having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.  - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate    that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.      [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) for reminding me of this one. --ed.]A Quicker Mouse- - - - - - - -  Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen  when you move your mouse.  I use "xset m 3 10" in my .xinitrc file,  which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of  the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.  Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for  fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different  mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.    e.g. (for twm) :      menu "mouse settings" {        "Mouse Settings:"f.title"  Very Fast"! "xset m 7 10 &""  Normal (Fast)"! "xset m 3 10 &""  System Default (Un-Accelerated)"! "xset m default &""  Glacial"! "xset m 0 10 &"      }Programming Thoughts- - - - - - - - - - -  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :    To speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of    things you can do.  Some that stick out:    - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual      buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager      widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.    - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.    - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.      (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)    - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE      difference.    - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable      one.  Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :    Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based    applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying    out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some    tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the    differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)  [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]  Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :  - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.    Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but    they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the    blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most    cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to    run through it's event-loop again and again.  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.    This "Gfx Context Switching" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed    again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the    connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).Say What!?- - - - - -   Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:  David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :    How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs    on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your    machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the    same operation between client and server.  I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received  the following confirmation...  Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se):    I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big    difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage    and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This    helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was    essential when I only had 8 MB.  Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) :    [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as    your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a    major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in    absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.  Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :    Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle, X's    cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate    doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they    are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your    action.    The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2    cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going    over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved    buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing    even fewer context switches.----------------------------Other Sources of Information----------------------------  Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System  Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read.

For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUSand Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems.That said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-displayon a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse portwhich can be used to provide additional displays. For example, sayyou hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You couldput in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system.You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you tomix and match any combination of screens and displays. You couldhave 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays,or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically anycombination.Because of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the useof the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite differentin meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12screens in a display. As it so happens, there's a define in the serverthat determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h,MAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek,this is 12.As such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e.X server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of XI'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this isnot the case.We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Ofcourse, I could say "Buy all you want, we'll support more."-- ----Rusty Sanders, Megatek Corp. --> rgs@megatek.com or...         ...ucsd!    ...hplabs!hp-sdd!    ...ames!scubed!   ...uunet!

I've looked in the FAQ and the O-Reilly books and was unable tofind (an easy) means of finding out the state of state keys such asCapsLock and NumLock.  I can certainly track the events inside of mywindow and set a boolean there, but what if CapsLock is pressed inanother window?  I looked at XGrabKey() and decided it was definitelyNOT what I wanted to do.  I could find no convenience function to tellme that information.My question is this:  Is there a means of determining what the stateof CapsLock and/or NumLock is?An even more pointed question: Is there an easy means of making an Xkeyboard act like a PC keyboard?  ie, CapsLock is active, and the userpresses shift-a, I'd like to get a lowercase 'a' instead of 'A'.Any input is greatly appreciated. Please respond via email.  I willrepost a summary of my findings.Thanks, Ralph

If it has a GUI, I can usually accomplish what I want to do  fairly easily, the command line on the other hand often is  a long and painful experience.What I hate about GUI's:- Having to switch between the mouse and the keyboard. I guess  I have a strong one-handed preference. I like to use a  computer with one hand and use the other for holding something  like a piece of paper of a mug of tea. I have configured my  favorite editor so that most of the editing functions can be  done with one hand such as navigating, cutting, pasting,  searching, opening and saving files, etc. The main thing I  need to use both hands for is entering text.I guess I need to get one of those mice with, like, 20 buttonsor something and then I will have the best of both worlds.Brent

Free optionsThe BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2.Any other version of X386 will have slower performance, and willbe more difficult to compile.  Information on how to obtain XFree86is listed below.X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that wasdone by Thomas Roell (roell@sgcs.com).It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards.There are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4,X386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. youdon't need to patch it into the MIT source any more).X386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS (see below).2.

What is XFree86?   XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with   X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and   other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:    1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,       selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require       an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of       1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by       default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield       up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.    2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default       operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now       equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately       20% faster than X386 1.2.    3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,       or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4       with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from       SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.    4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.       Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about       the ATI and Trident drivers.    5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's       code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).    6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is       compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the       contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.    7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font       renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary       distributions.    8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.    9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA       cards is now included.   The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2   (they were not in XFree86 1.1):    1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of       available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200        (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).    2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the       monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a "two       headed" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only       been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).    3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.    4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to       consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for       more information.)    5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some        versions of these devices were not previously compatible).    6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor       timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous       documentation and a lot of experimentation).    7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including       implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many        vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more        information).    8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has       been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of       0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks       line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.    9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig       configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative       and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new       options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1)        manual page for more information on the format of this file).       Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file       in the source distribution for full details.   Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the   current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.4. What OSs are supported?    XFree86 supports:SVR4.2: Consensys V4.2SVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHCSVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2Linux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1BSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most activeBSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,but anyone should feel free to submit patches.If you are interested in tackling this, send mail toxfree86@physics.su.oz.au5. What video hardware is supported?   At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:Tseng ET4000Tseng ET3000Paradise PVGA1Western Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets ofthe PVGA1, and use its driver)Genoa GVGATrident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000ATI 18800, 28800All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,with the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in256 color mode.The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k ofvideo memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On theET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochromeserver, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going tonon-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  Toavoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree861.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixelclock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms arediscovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on howthese programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop sucha program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it withfuture XFree86 releases.If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as theOrchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will notwork with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details.In fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamondproducts, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributionsof code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).If you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISAvideo cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between theCPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. Itcould be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipseton the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lotof access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untestedtheory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things notworking on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86working fine on them.6. What about accelerated boards?At this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boardslike the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is availablein commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact<hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.A beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memorycontains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-planes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from eachof each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-buffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT codecould be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure).But for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-bufferimplementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,but nothing is yet available from the project.8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?Obviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To runX efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, dependingon the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).To build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space willbe required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable lower bound.9. Where can I get source for XFree86?Source patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22from MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:export.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)(For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)Refer to the README file under the specified directory for informationon which files you need to get to build your distribution.10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from:ftp.physics.su.oz.au- SVR4 binariesunder /XFree86/SVR4ftp.win.tue.nl- SVR4 binariesunder /pub/XFree86/SVR4ferkel.ucsb.edu- SVR4 binariesunder /pub/SVR4/XFree86stasi.bradley.edu- SVR4 binariesunder /pub/XFree86/SVR4blancmange.ma.utexas.edu- SVR3 (ISC) binariesunder /pub/ISCftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binariesunder /pub/pc/isc/XFree86tsx-11.mit.edu- Linux binariesunder /pub/linux/packages/X11agate.berkeley.edu- 386BSD binariesunder /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86ftp.cs.uwm.edu- Mach binariesunder /i386Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites mayarchive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution willcontain a README file that describes what files you need to takefrom the archive, and which compile-time option selections weremade when building the distribution.IV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?11. Installation directoriesThe top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot(/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, includefiles, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.This can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modifiedvia symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory isnonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installedalongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.12. Configuration filesThe XFree86 server reads a configuration file ("Xconfig") on startup.The search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented inthe server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modesDavid E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of knownclock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, andis in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database isalso available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept onexport.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updatedoccasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have thesettings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them toDavid for inclusion in the database.If this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and usethis description to get them right.  When you do, send the informationto David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.NOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and      is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot      clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from      your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.      You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your      Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up      starting the server in the future.14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kitIf you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible toreconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This isfully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.V) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?First of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).15. SVR4Why won't my xterm run properly?If your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should defineCONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run.csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no'The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymappingproblems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not beinstalled.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.16. SVR3Make sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running.17. 386BSDMake sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.Also, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey<Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in thefile XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:    agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2    wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2    grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.218. LinuxYou must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gccjump libraries installed.Make sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.If your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have torun the server as "X -pn". The default startup configuration assumesthat TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files/usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the-pn argument to X386.Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the majornumber 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is notowned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permitconsole output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, butstartx won't.When running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it witha tty, for example "xdm < /dev/console &".For more detailed information, please read the file README presentwith the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.19. MachMake sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.VI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?This section has been removed from the FAQ, since it isfully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.Please look at those files for information on building XFree86.VII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?20. BSD compatibility libraryA lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.awhich contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),seed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include<X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macrodefinitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions.  If you arelinking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of thesefunctions, then you should link with libXbsd.a21. ANSICCOPTIONSThis is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of theANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewritethe entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you'd seesomething likeCCOPTIONS="-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings"and to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to putCCOPTIONS="-O2 -fwritable-strings"in his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default ofANSICCOPTIONS="-ansi"CCOPTIONS="-O2 -fwritable-strings"and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:ANSICCOPTIONS=to get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible deathwith -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, becauseCCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one mustadd 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.XFree86 Contact Information    Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86    Core Team.

Even more when I realise how much a  burden ordinary X or Windows programming is. I also like Objective-C better  than I like C++.But, sometimes the restrictions are there. For instance it sometimes has to be  MS-Windows or X. Now I'm looking for pointers to tools on those environments  that come close to NeXTSTEP, the appkit etc. Also, environs that support rapid  prototyping (like with IB) without producing spaghetti-code as soon as you want  to do real work.Maybe STEPSTONE with some Windows version of a kit of UI objects?

I'd like to take the sources and modify them to add support for a ToolTalk-like message server, and maybe for ToolTalk while I'm at it, since the Sun-suppliedtextedit binary doesn't seem to speak tooltalk.However, the sources in the R5 contrib area seem to be for an olderversion of textedit than the version shipped with OpenWindows 3.  Forexample, the OWN 3.0 textedit includes drag and drop support and a dropsite in the main control area, while the source in contrib/xviewknows nothing about drag and drop.The textedit.c included in the xview sources says it's version 15.50,dated 5/22/90, while doing a 'what textedit' on the OWN 3.0 binary says:        textedit.c 2.62 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro        dragdrop.c 1.26 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro        tooltalk.c 2.16 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro        ds_relname.c    1.7 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun MicroSo, does anyone know if the 9/14/91 sources to textedit are available?I'd really like to work from the latest source if possible.Please reply by email, and I'll post a summary if there's enough interest.-- Matt LandauWaiting for a flash of enlightenment matt@centerline.com  in all this blood and thunder

The slow response can be avoided by calling GetValuefirst, and only using SetValue if the required location is different.The problem can also be avoided by making a tiny alteration in thelocation of the popup, so that the SetValue really does change thelocation of the popup. (We tried this just for a double check on thesource of the problem.)The solutions we have tried successfully are now as follows:1) Use "twm" or "mwm" rather than "olwm"2) Use "olwm", with resource "*wmTimeout: 10"3) Only reset the location of the popup window if it is truely changed.This is obviously working around some bug somewhere.Thanks -- Chris Ho-Stuart

I am new to X, so please excuse my lax (read: "probably incorrect")terminology!  Environment: Sun Sparc 10, SunOs 4.1.3.  X11R5 path level 23.  My X processis started by xdm.  i) I want to setup the backgroud (root window?) of the tvtwm display to     display the escherknot etc (grey is a very boring colour to work on)!     The setup is as follows:        lib/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0    -   xsetroot -bitmap ... etc        ~user/.xsession         -   xsetroot .... etc                                    tvtwm     There are also .tvtwmrc and .Xdefaults files in the (~user) home     directory.     The xsetroot in Xsetup_0 displays the appropriate bitmap in the xdm     login window as expected - very nice!     Unfortunately, when the users session is started, the background of the     tvtwm window reverts to grey.  If I manually type xsetroot... in an     xterm window when the session has started, the background is changed as     expected.     The question is: How do I retain the background from the login window     and/or specify a new background on a per-user basis as part of the     the users session startup? ii) When I open an Xterm on the Sparc 10, not all of the keys are recognised     and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters.     ie: real key       key shown on screen         ------------   -------------------         hash           back slash         tilde          pipe         double quote   at symbol         pound          hash         cursor key     not recognised     This is very annoying!  Is X at fault here or the machine setup?  I have     installed the xterm drivers that came with X11R5 in both terminfo and     termcap as they seemed more uptodate.     Typing set in an xterm window shows a terminal type of xterm - as     expected!  Any help on how to correct either of these problems much appreciated!

The pulldown is displayed but then nobutton actions have any effect. Sometimes pressing <Return> willunstick the application but not usually. It looks like the pulldown isgrabbing the focus and never letting go. Other windows on the displaycontinue to get updated so the server isn't hanging. If I log in fromanother terminal and kill the Motif application then everything getsback to normal. The same application when run against other X servers(including MIT X11R5 Xsun, DecWindows, Tektronix X terminal) has noproblems. This is obviously a OpenWindows problem but I need awork-around since most of our customers are OpenWindows users.I have tried the following things:    1. Installing the latest version of the OpenWindows server patch       (100444-37).    2. Using mwm (version 1.2.2) instead of olwm.    3. Applying the patch specified in the Motif FAQ (question 110).       This had the effect of disabling the point-and-click method of       menu interaction (as opposed to the click-and-drag method), and       screwing up the menu mnemonics keys. It did seem to help, but I       was still able to get the application to hang.Repeat By:This is an intermittent problem so you'll have to try several times.Click and release on a menu heading (pulldown menu will pop up)Click and release on a menu itemRepeat until application hangsAny help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.--Skip Koppenhaverskip@eco.twg.com

The first sentence describing the bitmap resource in theMenuButton section of the "Athena Widget Set - C Language Interface"documentation states      bitmap      A bitmap to display instead of the label.One way round this might be to make use of the button's backgroundPixmapresource, but remember that you, or a user of your application, won't be ableto set it from a resource file. Also, the button won't automatically be thesize of the bitmap. The bitmap will be tiled if necessary, or you could set thebutton's dimensions to match its size.Jim---J.K.Wight@newcastle.ac.ukDepartment of Computing Science, University of Newcastle,  Tel: +44 91 222 8238Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 7RU, United Kingdom.

In this configuration, X windowsapplications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However, if he opens up asecond xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window,giving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font.   The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initialone references a different name in the Xsession file, with prettiercolours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that onlyopening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, ALLX applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from thecommand line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a differentfont (using the -fn option), no problems.  It would seem that thedefault xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to loseall of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of thefonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the fontdirectories/hash-tables.   Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a differentfont and hope for the best, does anyone have any ideas?More info:  This is the most recent MIPS workstation (R4000 I believe),       with the most current operating system and running X11R5.       It is not mwm's fault, as the same problems occur under twm, etc.

You have toprovide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border isCopyFromParent, which is not valid when the window's depth doesn'tmatch its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth, or aborder-pixel, and the problem should go away.There is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate thatCopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter toXCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably definesCopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, soyou are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlibimplementation not providing stricter type-checking.  (To be fair, I'mnot entirely certain it's possible for Xlib to catch this.)der Mousemouse@mcrcim.mcgill.edu

However, the best source of general information on building the X11 release is found in the Release Notes. The file is bundled separately from the rest of the release, so if it's become separated from your sources you can FTP another copy separately: the file RELNOTES.[ms,PS,TXT] at the top of the distribution. The file RELNOTES is also available from the xstuff mail server.In addition, O'Reilly & Associates's Volume 8 on X Administrationincludes information on configuring and building X.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  94)  Why doesn't my Sun with a cg6 work with R5?Apparently gcc is the problem; it seems to produce fine code for allSun displays except for the cgsix. The new sunGX.o distributed with fix-07 may fix the problem (note: not known to work on Solaris).----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  95)  Why doesn't my Sun with SunOS 4.1 know about _dlsym, etc.?If you get errors with _dlsym _dlopen _dlclose undefined, link with libdl.a.  Add "-ldl" to your and eventually your site.def.  You may want to surround it with "-Bstatic -ldl -Bdynamic" if you add it to the EXTRA_LIBRARIESvariable, since "syslibs" get added after EXTRA_LIBRARIES on the eventual compilation command; otherwise you may not have a shared libdl.  (Or compile the stubs shared.)[thanks to Joe Backo (joe.backo@East.Sun.COM), 12/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  96)  What is this strange problem building X clients on SunOS 4.1.2?In SunOS 4.1.2 Sun fixed a shared-library bug in ld which conflictswith the way X11R4 builds the shared Xmu library, causing these symbols to beundefined when building some X11 clients: _get_wmShellWidgetClass_get_applicationShellWidgetClassCompiling "-Bstatic -lXmu -Bdynamic" appears to work. To solve the problem if you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt), please contact your local Sun office and request the following patches:Patch i.d.      Description100512-02       4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 libXt Jumbo patch100573-03       4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 undefined symbols when using                        shared libXmu[Greg Earle, earle@Sun.COM; 7/92] A source patch for use with the MIT X11R4 libraries was developed by Conrad Kimball (cek@sdc.boeing.com); it retrofits into R4 some fixes made in R5 toget around this problem. The patch is on export in [1/93]contrib/X11R4_sunos4.1.2_patch_version3.Z----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  97)  Why can't gcc compile X11R4 on my SPARC?I used gcc to compile the whole distribution, but I get several segmentationfaults when running X.Note first that gcc on RISC machines does not necessarily result inany performance increase; it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the680x0 or VAX platforms.Here is the problem: gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing structures as arguments and returning them as function values, so when gcc-compiled parts of X are linked with Sun-supplied functions that pass or return structs, run-time errors occur.  Affected programs include rgb and the server.This is from the GCC manual:On the Sparc, GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for structures.  It passes them by including their contents in the argumentlist, whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by reference.This really ought to be fixed, but such calling conventions are not yetsupported in GNU CC, so it isn't straightforward to fix it.The convention for structure returning is also incompatible, and`-fpcc-struct-return' does not help.You can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for justthe routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with compilation flags.  Files which need to be compiled using cc include:server/os/4.2bsd/oscolor.c rgb/rgb.cIn addition, several of the "inet_" functions use structs as args orreturn values:  clients/xhost/xhost.c clients/xauth/gethost.c. Calls to inet_addr in /lib/CLX/socket.c and lib/X/XConnDis.c are possibly harmless as they don't involve structs.[collected by bashford@scripps.edu (Don Bashford); 8/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  98)  What are these I/O errors running X built with gcc?When I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error "Getting interface configuration: Operation not supported on socket. Fatal server bug! no screens found."Running the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn't work. You can do this simple test:#include <sys/ioctl.h>SIOCGIFCONFRun that through cc -E and gcc -E.  The last line of output is the piece of interest; it should be identical (modulo irrelevant differences like whitespace).  If the gcc version has 'x' where the cc version has 'i', your fixincludes run didn't work for some reason or other; go back to your gccsources and run `fixincludes`; then rebuild the X distribution. If they are identical, try running a make clean in mit/server and rebuilding, just to make sure everything gets compiled with the proper include files.  [courtesy der Mouse, mouse@LARRY.MCRCIM.MCGILL.EDU; 9/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  99)  What are these problems compiling X11R4 on the older Sun3?In mit/server/ddx/sun/sunCG3C.c, we have found "missing" defines for CG3AC_MONOLEN, CG3BC_MONOLEN, CG3AC_ENBLEN, CG3BC_ENBLEN. What should these be?The R4 Errata list distributed after X11R4 mentions that you can addthese lines to the file on older SunOS versions (e.g. 3.5) to compile:        #define CG3AC_MONOLEN (128*1024)        #define CG3AC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN        #define CG3BC_MONOLEN CG3AC_MONOLEN        #define CG3BC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLENHowever, the Sun3 should not actually ever have the CG3 device, and so references to it can be removed from mit/server/ddx/sun/sunInit.c and the Imakefile.  [11/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 100)  What are these problems compiling the X server on SunOS 4.1.1?The file <sundev/cg6reg.h> isn't being found.Sun omitted <sundev/cg6reg.h> from SunOS 4.1.1. Remove the #include from sunCG6C.c and replace it with the line #define CG6_VADDR_COLOR   0x70016000The file has changed from earlier versions of SunOS and should not be copied from another distribution.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 101)  What are these problems using R4 shared libraries on SunOS 4?All of the executables that I try to run have the following results:ld.so: libXmu.so.4: not foundor even:ld.so: call to undefined procedure __GetHostname from 0xf776a96cIf you are building with shared libraries on a Sun, remember that you need to run "ldconfig" as root after installing the shared libraries (if you'veinstalled X on a file-server, run it on the server's clients, too).  While building and installing the distribution, you need to be careful to avoid linking against any existing X shared libraries you might have (e.g. those distributed with OpenWindows).  You should make sure you do not have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set in your environment during the build or the installation.  If you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs, please note that the shared libraries must be installed in /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, or /usr/5lib for these programs to work (or else those programs must be linked statically). [courtesy MIT X Consortium]Note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; itattempts, however, to use the shared libraries before they have been installed.You can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -Bstatic tomost C compilers).----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 102)  Can OLIT programs run with R5 Xt? (_XtQString undefined)This is a bug in the OLIT.  _XtQString was an external symbol that existed in X11R4 (upon which OW 3.0's libXt is based).  It wasn't documented and was removed in X11R5 (MIT's guarantee of upward compatibility between the R4 and R5libraries only applied to the documented interface).  A workaround is to temporarily set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the X11R4or OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program against.[10/92; from Barry Margolin (barmar@think.com); 3/93 from Jeff Francis (jpf@heliocentric.com)]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 103)  How do I get around the SunOS 4.1 security hole?There is a security problem with certain R4 clients (xterm and xload)running under SunOS 4.1 that have been installed setuid root and are using shared libraries; to avoid the problem, do one of these:1) make the program non-setuid. You should consult your systemadministrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and /dev/kmem) usedby these programs, to make sure that you do not create additional security problems at your site.2) relink the programs statically (using -Bstatic).3) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute pathsto the libraries.[from rws@expo.lcs.mit.edu (Bob Scheifler), 12/90]The R5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against thenewly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this prevents an suidprogram from being built with libraries specified relatively. Note that this may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFS-mounted disks. Xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 104)  How do I get around the frame-buffer security hole?On many systems the frame-buffer is unsecured by default; this permits anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by accessing the frame-buffer directly, or, as less of a privacy issue but perhapsmore annoying, to [accidentally] start up a second X session on your console display. Check the man page for fbtab(5).[Thanks to Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca); 2/93.]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 105)  TOPIC: BUILDING X PROGRAMS ----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 106)  What is Imake?Imake is not a replacement for the make program; instead, it is amakefile-generator that takes advantages of the include-file and macro-processing capabilities of the C preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles suitable for building software on a particular system. Although it is not specific to X, the X release uses it to help solve a number of the configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable.Imake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process bywhich the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configurationfiles, and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not obvious.There have been several different versions of imake; the R3, R4, andR5 versions are different.You can obtain information on imake from these sources:- the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information onusing Imake to build X- the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information- on the R4 tapes, contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes' R3/R4guide to imake.- the R5 mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by JimFulton on an early version of Imake- Paul Dubois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful explanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non-supported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.eduin the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-X11R4.ms (troff) and config-X11R4.ps (PostScript). Some supplemental appendices are nearby. [7/91: document version is now 1.06] These imake papers are available by email;mail a message body of "send imake-stuff help" to almanac@primate.wisc.edu.- see "System Administration - Imake: Friend of Foe?" by Dinah McNuttin the November 1991 issue of SunExpert.- German readers should expect in June 1992 an article "Das Meta-Make / I make, you make / Schwerelos" by Rainer Klute in "iX Multiuser-Multitasking-Magazin", directed at application programmers needing towrite Imakefiles. An English-language derivative of this article is in TheX Journal, issue 2:1.- The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains Paul Davey's article ondemystifying Imake.- Alain Brossard's working document full of tips on Imake is in sasun1.epfl.ch:pub/imakefile.1.Z.[1/91;12/91;5/92;8/92]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 107)  Where can I get imake?Versions are distributed with the R4 and R5 releases. An earlier version is distributed with the X11R3 release; some third-party toolkits redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the template and configuration files. There are no real standards for such configuration files, although most *current* contributed software expects the templates distributed with X11R5.export contains the R5 distribution unpacked, so you can pick up imakewithout picking up the entire distribution.A stand-alone version of Imake, but one stemming from X11R5, is inftp.germany.eu.net:pub/X11/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.Z (192.76.144.75).----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 108)  I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile. What to do?If you have R4 or R5 installed on your system, run "xmkmf". This is a script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. The output is a Makefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile. Then run make, which will use that new Makefile to compile the program.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 109)  Why can't I link to the Xlib shape routines?When I try to compile certain programs, I get the following link error:Undefined:_XShapeQueryExtension_XShapeCombineMaskThese routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X (SHAPE)which was introduced in the MIT X11R4 distribution and allows non-rectangularwindows.  Like the other sample server extensions, the shape extension will only run on a server which supports it.  Pre-X11R4 servers, as well as many vendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case they will display rectangular windows anyway.In order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library libXext.a.  In the X11R4 distribution, this library and the associated includeswill be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files, do not despair:  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be compiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you canprobably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X libraries.[from John B. Melby, melby%yk.fujitsu.co.jp@uunet.uu.net, 3/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 110)  What are these problems with "_XtInherit not found" on the Sun?When I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine I get the error "ld.so: symbol not found _XtInherit".What you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R4 libXt.a to get Sun shared libraries working.  Apparently, you can't share a function that is both called and compared, as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting _XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby guaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in Initialize.c, where XtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normallybe called.You are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normalXt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere. 1) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a connection to the X server.  [OSF/Motif's 1.1.0 UIL had this problem; it calledXtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your program; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in.2) alternatively, your program doesn't need any Xt functions and iscorrect in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView program. In this case, you can remove -lXt from your link command. It should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically,although this will certainly solve the problem.[from Jordan Hayes (now jordan@MooreNet.COM) and Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be); 11/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 111)  Why can't I compile my R3 Xaw contrib programs under the new X?I have a program that worked well under X11R3. When I try to link it under the current version of X, I get this message:Undefined:_XtScrollBarSetThumb_XtTextSetInsertionPoint_XtTextReplaceThere were several name changes in the Athena widget set (in additionto the header files moving into <X11/Xaw/>); these are mentioned in the R4release notes. In this case, these functions are not really Xt functions butare part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt* to Xaw*.[10/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 112)  TOPIC: PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 113)  Why doesn't my program get the keystrokes I select for (sic)?The window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from onewindow to another.  In order to get keystrokes, your program must ask thewindow manager for the input focus.  To do this, you must set up what arecalled "hints" for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based, youcan use something like the following:        XWMHints wmhints;        ...        wmhints.flags = InputHint;        wmhints.input = True;        XSetWMHints(dpy, window, &wmhints)If your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics, you can set the XtNinput resource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you don't havesource, you can start up the application with the resource '*input:True'.Certain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having this done. If you are using Sun's OpenWindows olwm, you can also add this resourceto your defaults file to use clients that aren't ICCCM-compliant.OpenWindows.FocusLenience:       true[mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 114)  How do I figure out what window manager is running?You can't reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could bespoofed in any case. For most cases, you shouldn't care which window manager is running, so long as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in which particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking forparticular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively, it may be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to takeadvantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm's push-pin menus) in orderto give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window manager's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing;this surely leads to future compatibility problems.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 115)  Is there a skeleton X program available?There is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the Macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional development. In X, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive application builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Goodapplications which you might look to manipulate when you want to "test just this one little thing" include contrib/clients/xskel, a simple R4 program that puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point forquick hacks, the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4 distributions, and the Xlib "Hello World" example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and R4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R4 Xlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x  by Glenn Widener of Tektronix. [3/90]In addition, a sample Xt program (for Xaw or Xm) by Rainer Klute showing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display connection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.Z. [4/92]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 116)  Why does XtGetValues not work for me (sic)?The XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget issensitive to the type of variable. Your code may be doing something like this:{Arg args[3];int i;int sensitive;/* oops; wrong data type */i=0;XtSetArg (args[i], XtNsensitive, &sensitive); i++;XtGetValues(widget, args, i );...}But XtNsensitive is a Boolean, which on most machines is a single byte; declaring the variable "sensitive" as Boolean works properly. This problem comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types Dimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar problems if those types are actually short. In general: you are safe if youuse the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widget's man page.[11/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 117)  Why don't XtConfigureWidget/XtResizeWidget/XtMoveWidget work?You're probably trying to use these functions from application code.They should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a parent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising functions, XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest(), are also for use only by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent.The only way for your application to request a geometry change for awidget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources.Although this will result in the widget-internal functions' being called, yourapplication code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the widgets' data becoming corrupted.[The Xlib calls XMoveWindow() and XResizeWindow() should similarly be avoided; they shouldn't be used to change XtNx, XtNy, XtNwidth, or XtNheight.]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 118)  Why isn't there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow?Although there are various details of the current implementation ofthe Xt internals which make reparenting difficult, the major reason that nosuch call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources forthe "new" widget should be. Resources are typically set based on the locationin the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves?What should happen to the widget's children? And by the time such semantics aredefined, there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired resources, as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in creating a new widget.Note that reparenting is possible in the OI toolkit.----------------------------------------------------------------------David B.

Do I need the Motif private header files and source,   or can I make do with the public headers that are provided?   "Motif" includes Xt in this context.Yes.  You'll find it almost impossible without the sourceat this point.  It does depend on how ambitious you are andhow concerned you are about compliance with the generalinterface and items like traversal.   One widget is a multi-column list (which lots of people have   already written, I am sure), and would therefore be probably be   a subclass of List rather than something simple like an Xt class.   Is this more difficult (in principle, not lines of code)?I'm not sure what you're asking.  You could create somethingwhich is very much like a true multi-column list by placingseveral lists within a geometry manager,  and putting thatmanager within an automatic scrolled window.  This wouldn'tbe good for very large lists,  but you might consider thisas an alternative.   Alternatively, if anyone has a multi-column list widget they   could sell me, this might save me from having to write one!   Does it by any chance exist in Motif 1.2 already (I do not   yet have the spec)?Motif 1.2 does not have a multi-column list in it.  Have youlooked at commercial sets?  There are also some PD widget sets,  one of these might have a multi-column listyou could port.--Douglas S.

Investigation showed that some Xservers will happily return any size up to the size of the root window, whileothers return some fixed limit of more reasonable size. The interesting thingto me is that the same server binary acts differently on different hardware -a Sun4 with a cg2 will claim cursors up to root window size are OK, while aSun4 with a cg6 will stop at 32x32. So far I've also seen this behavior onNCD and Phase-X X terminals and have been told it also occurs on HPs. Actually, the NCD is even more liberal - sizes much larger then the rootwinodw are gladly returned as OK. Is XQueryBestCursor semi-broken or is thisbehavior correct?

Since I give the user thecapability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to beresized, I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events.The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure eventcalls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a "fake" Exposeevent (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct)to draw the data.Quest 1.When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.)I get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the sizeis changed.  I assume I'm getting cascading events.

OPEN LOOK is a specification of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).    A GUI determines the `look and feel' of a system -- the shape of    windows, buttons and scroll-bars, how you resize things, how you    edit files, etc.    The OPEN LOOK GUI is specified, developed and maintained jointly by    Sun Microsystems and AT&T (or USL?).    See Also:Bibliography@ What is OpenWindows?    OpenWindows is a windowing environment that conforms to the OPEN LOOK    Graphical User Interface Specifications.  It's compatible with the    X11 window system from MIT as well as (currently) Sun's NeWS and SunView,    so you can intermix programs written for any of those systems.    It comes from Sun and also with System V Release 4 from certain vendors.    OpenWindows is sometimes also called openwin or xnews, after the    program used to start it and the main executable itself, respectively.    It should not be called `Windows' or 'OPEN LOOK' or `OpenLook', as    these terms are either wrong or apply to something else.    A commerical OpenWindows source licence costs about $5,000 for the server,    plus about $25,000 for DeskSet, and another $40,000 for ToolTalk.    The current versions of OpenWindows for various platforms are:SunOS 4.1.1 on Sun 3: 2.0Solaris 1.x (SunOS 4.1.x) on SPARC: 3.0Solaris 2.0 (SunOS 5) on SPARC: 3.0.1    See Also:Mixing X11 and OpenWindowsWhere can I get it?@ What are OLIT, XView and TNT?    These are all toolkits for programmers to use in developing programs    that conform to the OPEN LOOK specifications.  See the Bibliography    for documentation on the individual toolkits.  Here's a brief summary:    OLIT was AT&T's OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit for the X Window system;    it used a widget set, and was probably the easiest for people who were    already X11/Xt programmers to learn.  You could buy the source from AT&T,    although you didn't get the same version tht Sun ship.  Sun includes the    OLIT library in OpenWindows (q.v.); it is also often included in    System V Release 4.  It was written in C.  The release of OLIT in    OpenWindows 3.0 was OLIT 3.0.  OLIT support passed to USL (then a    division of AT&T, now owned by Novell), who replaced it with MoOLIT (q.v.).    Note that because of the nature of Xt subclassing, you will probably    want or need OLIT source in order to develop a large application or    anything else that uses subclasses.    [see the proceedings of the 1991 X Technical Conference]    XView is Sun's toolkit for X11, written in C.  XView is similar in    programmer interface to SunView.  There's even a shell script to help    migrate source code from SunView to XView. XView is often said to be    the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with X Windows.    The XView toolkit is included in OpenWindows, and full source is    available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (and elsewhere).    The current version of XView from Sun is 3.0.    Despite rumours to the contrary -- some even from within Sun -- the    XView toolkit is *NOT* about to be dropped by Sun.  XView *will* be    included in the next release of OpenWindows, unlike NeWS.    On the other hand, the XView toolkit is not likely to receive as much    attention from Sun in the future as OLIT.    The NeWS Toolkit (TNT) was an object-oriented programming system based    on the PostScript language and NeWS.  TNT implements many of the    OPEN LOOK interface components required to build the user interface of    an application.  It's currently included in OpenWindows.    The current version of TNT from Sun is 3.1; Release 3 contains some    incompatibilities with `tNt' 1.0 and TNT 2.0, but Sun are committed to    supporting the API, at least until they stop NeWS support some time    later this year and replace it with Display PostScript.  Wail.    You might ask what `is committed to' means in this context; the    answer seems to be that it means absolutely nothing.    Sun currently asserts that it is committed to OLIT, however.    The C++ User Interface Toolkit (UIT) consists of an object-oriented C++    class library layered on top of XView and a tool to generate code from    DevGuide 3 GIL files.  The UIT also includes features that simplify    event management and the use of PostScript and color.  It is said to be    compatible with OpenWindows V2 and V3, and presumably V3.0.1, since the    release mentions that it works on Solaris 2.    UIT is not an official Sun-supported product but an ongoing project of    various people within Sun.  It can be found on export.lcs.mit.edu in    the MIT contrib directory as UITV2.tar.Z (use binary mode!).@ Where does Motif fit in?    It doesn't :-).  Motif is an alternative Graphical User Interface that    is being developed by OSF.It has a `look and feel' reminiscent of    Microsoft Windows and the OS/2 Presentation Manager.  There are no non-    commercial Motif toolkits available, although the Motif source is sold    reasonably cheaply by OSF.Although Motif is currently available on    more platforms than OpenWindows, the OPEN LOOK GUI is almost certainly    used on many more machines, simply because Sun (and SysVR4) have such a    large installed base.    Sun's CD/WARE Volume 2 contains a roadmap for improving Motif    applications by converting them to OLIT [:-)]; there are also notes in    the `Periodic Table' OLIT demo, $OPENWINHOME/demo/olittable.@ What is MoOLIT?    MoOLIT is a version of OLIT from AT&T/USL that lets users choose between    a Motif and an OPEN LOOK UI feel at run-time.  It will be part of System V    Release 4.2.    Contact: Joanne Newbauer, jo@usl.com, (908) 522-6677@ What about that Display PostScript thing?    Sun and Adobe have agreed that Sun will include the DPS extension to X    in the next release of OpenWindows.  DPS is essentially a badly designed    hack on top of a slow Level 2 PostScript interpreter intended to give a    very small subset of the functionality of NeWS whilst simultaneously    being harder to use, as I understand it.  The only real advantage it    has over NeWS is that the manual is much smaller, being generally less    complete; DPS is also available on more kinds of machine.    Performance on our RS/6000 is not suitable for interactive work;    what it will be like on the SPARCStation remains to be seen.    Note that whereas X/NeWS fonts are shared by both subsystems, the DPS    extension to X does _not_ make Type 1 PostScript fonts available to    ordinary X11 programs.  It is not like ATM on a PC in this regard.    (there is at least one third-party version which does make fonts    available, however)Subject: Window Managers -- olwm, olvwm@ What are olwm and olvwm?    They are window managers.  A window manager is the part of the X Window    system (e.g. X11) that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows    on the screen, and for managing the user's interaction with the windows.    Olwm is the standard OPEN LOOK window manager.    It's included with all of the OpenWindows (q.v.) implementations, and    you can also get the source by ftp, since Sun donated it.    Olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a `virtual desktop' (hence the    `v' in its name).  It shows a little map on the screen, with the    currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle. You can    move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys.  This    lets you run several clients (applications) and move the display around    from one to the other.  Olvwm was derived from the OpenWindows 3.0 olwm    by Scott Oaks; you need to have XView 3.0 to compile it.    Get olvwm from an ftp site such as export.lcs.mit.edu (in the contrib    directory; there are three patches).@ Can I use my favorite window manager with OpenWindows instead of olwm?    Yes.  If you use twm, for example, or mwm, you won't be able to use    the Pin and Unpin feature of olwm, and you (probably) won't see the    footers some windows use to display certain messages.    If you use twm, you'll want to use the f.delete function to unpin menus    and get rid of programs that don't have a `quit' button when not run    under olwm.    For twm, put this in your $HOME/.twmrc:LeftTitleButton "target" = f.delete    where "target" is a 16x16 icon from /usr/include/X11/bitmaps.    Alternatively, try# Add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwmLeftTitleButton ":menu" = f.menu "OL.menu"menu "OL.menu" {    "Quit"         f.delete}    For mwm, you can double-click on the menu icon on the left of the title    bar to dismiss a pop-up window (I am told).    See the manual page for your window manager (twm, etc).Subject: OpenWindows, Terminals, and Other Displays@ Can I use olwm and olvwm without OpenWindows or on an X Terminal?    The OpenWindows xnews server combines SunView, NeWS (PostScript) and X11.    This means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems.    Unfortunately, it means that some OpenWindows programs need either NeWS    or SunView support, and thus won't run on an X terminal.  This includes    pageview in particular.    You can use olwm or olvwm (see above) on an X terminal or a non-Open-    Windows display, and most OPEN LOOK clients (e.g. OLIT or XView ones)    will work perfectly well.  You may find that you get complaints about    fonts not being found.  If so, see the Fonts section below.    If you are running the window manager built-in to an NCD terminal, you    may have problems with input focus; setting *Input: True in the terminal's    XDefault file in /usr/lib/X11/xdm may or may not help.Subject: Configuration Files: Getting started with OpenWindows     @ What configuration files do I need to know about?    .xinitrc and .xsessionrc    The first time you run OpenWindows, a .xinitrc file will be created in    your login directory ($HOME).  If it already exists, you might have to    edit it somewhat; it's simplest to move it and any other old X11 files    you have to another directory, and then merge the old and new files.    If your site uses xdm, you should use .xsession instead of .xinitrc,    since xdm doesn't look at your .xinitrc file.    .openwin-init, .openwin-menu and .openwin-sys    These are optional files you can create in your $HOME directory,    depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you use.    Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib (normally /usr/openwin/lib) for these files    without the leading . and copy any you want to change.  You may need    to edit your .xinitrc to get them recognized.  If you are not on an    X terminal, you will want to run a console window (such as cmdtool -C,    shelltool -C, xterm -C) or Chuck Musciano's "contool" program so that    system output will be directed there instead of writing over your screen.    Note that .openwin-sys is not executed unless you edit .xinitrc.    .Xdefaults    You can put X Windows resource specifications in here.  In particular,    it is a good idea to include at least:OpenWindows.FocusLenience:true*Input: TRUE    These allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to receive input even if they    forget to ask for it.    Props, the program that runs when you select `properties' from the default    root menu under olwm or olvwm, writes your choices into .Xdefaults.    Don't put comments in .Xdefaults, since `props' deletes them.    .startup.ps    This is the NeWS user profile file, read by OpenWindows (actually xnews)    on startup. This is documented in the NeWS programming manual, near the    back.  The most useful thing to put here is PostScript code to change    the keyboard repeat rate, although you must be very careful, since a    syntax error in the PostScript means that xnews will either not start up    at all or will get broken in strange ways.The NeWS manual gives code    that is both incorrect and insufficient.    WARNING: things in this file rarely work on both OpenWindows 2 and 3.    Note that the mouse speed is best set in your .xinitrc with xset m; see    the man page for xset ("man xset", and "xset -help") for more information.    Here's what $HOME/.startup.ps  should look like if you want a delay of    about a third of a second (300000 microseconds), and a repeat rate of    twenty or so keys per second (30000 microseconds between repeats) for    OpenWindows 3.  You'll have to experiment a bit because the RepeatTime    is the delay between keys sent, and thus doesn't include the time to    process each key, which is probably higher on my 4/110 than on your    SuperSPARC 10/51 GTi injection :-)  Again, this is for OpenWindows 3...% don't want the demos - see p. xxxii of NeWS Toolkit Reference Manual% /IncludeDemos? false defUserProfile begin    /KeyRepeatThresh 0 300000 timeval storetimeval def    /KeyRepeatTime 0 30000 timeval storetimeval def    % Note: 300000 and 30000 differ greatly...end    You must also have a .user.ps file in the same directory, like this:/NeWS 3 0 findpackage beginpackage/TNTCore 3 0 findpackage beginpackage/TNT 3 0 findpackage beginpackageClassRepeatKeys pop% force repeat.ps to autoloadendpackage endpackage endpackage    If you change these parameters, you can test them without restarting the    OpenWindows server like this:$ psh -i .startup.psWelcome to X11/NeWS Version3$ psh -iWelcome to X11/NeWS Version3/classinit ClassRepeatKeys send%%% now press control-D    You can also either of these two files (.startup.ps and .user.ps) to make    the root window be "retained", so that a PostScript drawing on the    background won't be erased when you move windows:frambuffer /Retained true put    will do this.  Note that this may increase the amount of memory used    by the NeWS server (xnews) dramatically.        See also:Trouble Shooting: It Won't Let Me TypeTrouble Shooting: Is there an easy way to edit Xdefaults?Environment Variables@ How can I configure OPEN LOOK for a left-handed mouse and keyboard?    You can use xmodmap to change the mouse buttons, but be prepared for one    or two occasional surprises.  See also "man 7 xview" for a list of    keybindings you can change, at least for XView programs.    With OpenWindows 2.0, you can use defaultsedit to set the mouse mappings    and then let SunView handle them.  The status returned by svenv should    tell you whether your server is running under SunView or not; put this    in your .xinitrc:    if eval `svenv -env`    thenxmodmap -e "pointer = 1 2 3"input_from_defaults    elsexmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1"    fi@ How can I get the screen to go blank when the system is idle?    Run screenblank from /etc/rc.local if you can; it's a boring but    effective screen saver.  See `man screenblank'.    Under Solaris 2 you'll need to copy screenblank from an older system, as    it's not supplied.  Then add a new file in /etc/rc2.d to make the system    run screenblank automatically.Subject: Key Bindings, Cut and Paste@ How do I cut and paste between XTerm and OpenWindows programs?    To go from XTerm to textedit (say):    * Select the text you want to copy by dragging the SELECT mouse button      in xterm    * Press COPY in the XTerm (this key is L6, or Meta+c (the O'Reilly      XView manual gets this wrong)    * Move to the textedit window, and press PASTE (L8 or Meta+v)    If this doesn't work, see Trouble Shooting: Cut and Paste   To go the other way, from textedit to XTerm:    * Select the text in textedit.  No need to use COPY    * Move to the XTerm window and press ADJUST (the middle mouse button).    * You can also use the COPY/CUT and PASTE buttons.@ COPY/PASTE is boring. What short-cuts are available?    Quick Copy within textedit, mailtool, etc:    * Click SELECT to get a text caret where you want the copied text to go    * Press and HOLD DOWN the PASTE (or CUT) button    * Select the text you want to copy/move.  You'll see that it's underlined      or crossed out, as appropriate.  (In the jed demo it goes grey)    * Let go of the PASTE (or CUT) button.    * The text you underlined or crossed out appears at the insert caret.    Drag and Drop to Move a Selection    * Select the text you want to copy or move, by dragging or multiple-      clicking the SELECT or ADJUST mouse button    * Put the mouse pointer anywhere within the selection    * Press and HOLD DOWN down the SELECT mouse button, and move the mouse      pointer a little to the right; you'll see the cursor changes to be the      first 3 letters of the text (or some other icon).    * Still holding SELECT down, move the mouse over the point where you want      to drop the text    * You may see the mouse pointer change to a rifle-sight or target, to show      that it's OK to drop things here    * Let go of SELECT, and the text is moved.This works in text fields of      dialogue boxes as well as in text subwindows.    Drag and Drop to Copy a Selection    * This is the same as using Drag and Drop to Move a Selection, except that      you must hold the CONTROL key down as well as the SELECT mouse button.@ What are the default key bindings in textedit and elsewhere?    See the man page for textedit(1) for some of them.    In general, the editing/moving commands go in the opposite direction when    shifted - e.g. Ctrl+w deletes a word, and Ctrl+W deletes the word to the    right of the insert point.Meta-i - include file    Meta-f - find selection (forward/backward)Ctrl-a - start of line    Ctrl-< - back wordCtrl-e - end of line    Ctrl-> - forward wordCtrl-w - delete word    Ctrl-u - delete to start/END of lineCtrl-Return - move to end/START of document    See the O'Reilly XView Reference Manual for a list of some of the default    keys; see also the olwm or olvwm manual page.@ What can I put in my .ttysrc?

Contact SunSoft (or Sun) and ask for the Catalyst OPEN LOOK guide,    which lists over 200 pages of applications, and also the _huge_    Catalyst listing of products for Suns, updated six-monthly.    Sun's free CDWare CD/ROMs each contain demo versions of several popular    OPEN LOOK applications.  Often you can simply contact the vendor    concerned to have the license upgraded from demo, and receive the full    product documentation.    SunPICS produces a CD/ROM for NeWSPrint users, Printer's Pallate, which    contains NeWSprint drivers for a variety of printers and plotters, as    well as 600 scaleable fonts that you can license.

Yes, under either Solaris 2.0 or 2.1 (I'm not sure which).    Or, Not Yet, in other words.    If you have FrameMaker there is a utility to import them, I'm told.    The 57 fonts supplied with OpenWindows are fully hinted, though, and    comparing them to the Microsoft Windows and Apple TrueType fonts is    interesting...  The F3 font format is described in a publication from the    Sun OpenFonts group, listed in the Bibliography below.  Documentation on    the unbundled version of TypeScaler is also available from Sun OpenFonts.    You can buy F3 fonts from SunPICS, Monotype, Linotype, URW and probably    other major foundries.    SunPICS' NeWSPrint software supports Type 1 fonts.@ Improving font rendering time    Although the Sun type renderer (TypeScaler) is pretty fast, it's not as    fast as loading a bitmap :-).  You can pre-generate bitmap fonts for sizes    that you use a lot, and you can also alter and access the font cache    parameters. If you have a lot of memory you might want to increase the    font cache size.$ psh -iWelcome to X11/NeWS Version3 <--- psh will say this at youcurrentfontmem =% type this line ...300% and here's whai my server was using -- 300 Kbytes1024 setfontmem% Just to check:currentfontmem =1024    See pp. 328ff of the NeWS 3.0 Programmer's Guide.

Your licence forbids you from using the    fonts on another machine, and unless you have NeWSPrint you shouldn't    use them for printing.  Having said all that...  you can use makeafb and    convertfont to generate bdf files that you can compile with bdftosnf or    bdftopcf.    Use mftobdf (from the SeeTeX distribution) to convert TeX pk fonts to    X11 bdf format, which you can then use with either X11 or OenWindows.    You can also use der Mouse's "getbdf" to get bdf fonts from a running    X display server -- ftp: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) /X/getbdf@ Xview/OLIT fonts at 100 dpi    There aren't any.  More precisely, the various text fonts, such as    Lucida Typewriter Sans, are available at 100 dpi, and in fact are    scalable under OpenWindows. The glyph fonts are bitmaps, and don't    scale very well.Subject: Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages@ No manual entry for cm_lookup    If man doesn't seem to find OpenWindows commands, even though you are    running OpenWindows, try setting the MANPATH environment variable:MANPATH=$OPENWINHOME/share/man:/usr/man; export MANPATH    orsetenv MANPATH $OPENWINHOME/share/man:/usr/man    for csh users.  $OPENWINHOME should be /usr/openwin on most systems.@ window: Window creation failed to get new fd @ window: Base frame not passed parent window in environment @ Cannot create base frame.

See the next item for editing .XdefaultsSubject: Trouble Shooting: Cut and Paste not working@ I can't paste from xterm to XView (including Sun DeskSet) programs    Under OpenWindows 2, you need to add the following either to your    $HOME/.Xdefaults file, or to $OPENWINHOME/lib/app-defaults/XTerm instead:XTerm*VT100.Translations: #override \\<Key>L6:select-set(CLIPBOARD)\\n\\<Key>L8:insert-selection(CLIPBOARD)      You must not move the mouse between ending the selection and pressing    L8 (the Paste key)!    Under OpenWindows 3, this is already in the app-defaults file, so if it    isn't working, check that XFILESEARCHPATH is set to/usr/openwin/lib/%T/%N%S    and if it isn't, either set it or copy/merge the above lines from    $OPENWINHOME/lib/app-defaults/XTerm into /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm.

Use ps -xuaww | grep xv  to check that sv_xv_sel_svc is running    and that either you or root started it, depending on whether you started    OpenWindows with "openwin" or by logging in through xdm.    If not, start it.  If it dies, check that there is no /tmp/.sv_xv_sel_svc    before restarting it - you may need to be root to remove it, or you can    reboot your workstation.    Check that there is space in /tmp (use "df /tmp"), and also see if there    are a lot of files there with names like /tmp/tty.txt.a01246; if there are    several hundred of them, cut and paste may take so long that it times out.    Quit any deskset tools such as mailtool, filemgr and cm (calendar), start    a terminal emulator and remove and /tmp/tty.txt* and /tmp/Text* files    that are still there.  It's simplest to quit openwin and start it again    after doing that, if cut and paste was broken, but if it starts working    again you can just carry on.  Note that files in /tmp not owned by you    might be in use by another worker comrade, so don't remove those without    checking first!Subject: Trouble Shooting: Not authorized to use display    If you get error messages that look likeXlib:  connection to ":0.0" refused by serverXlib:  Internal error during connection authorization checkError: Can't Open display    try, on the machine running OpenWindows or X11,xhost +machine    where "machine" is the computer on which you ran the command that failed.

This lets ANY user on `happyboy' access your display.    With OpenWindows 3.0 you can also use xauth, and the Programmer's Guide     describes how to do this in Chapter 8, p. 101.  This is more secure.    Also check the man page for fbtab(5) to stop other users accessing the    framebuffer directly!

A known bug may make Guide's output dump core if you use these.    A workaround is to edit the Guide output, as it's only Guide's output    that's broken, not the actual check-box code.    This applies only to versions of DevGuide before Devguide 3.0.  If you're    still using an ancient DevGuide, you should upgrade as soon as possible;    the new one is fantastic!@ When I leave OpenWindows, my screen goes blank or my mouse cursor stays  on the screen.

Keys F11 and F12 changed from SunF36 and SunF37 to SunXK_F36 and SunXK_F37    respectively in OpenWindows 3.

(see also next item)@ Mixing X11 and OpenWindows    (see also next item)    Note that OpenWindows 3.0 includes the X11R4 core distribution (to patch    level 18), but not the contrib directory.  These notes apply to    OpenWindows 2.0, although you could also the do same sort of thing with    OpenWindows 3.0 and X11R5.    Install the X11 libraries in /usr/lib/X11.You can intermix OpenWindows    and X11R4 or X11R5, they're all compatible in this respect.    Put the X11 binaries in (for example) /usr/bin/X11.    Put /usr/bin/X11 last in your PATH, so that you get OpenWindows versions    of programs instead of X11 ones where appropriate, although this is a    matter of preference.  In any event, put the OpenWindows bin directory    first -- see the preceding item for more details on that.  If you have    /bin (or /usr/bin, they're the same directory on SunOS) earlier in    your PATH than $OPENWINHOME/bin/xview, you'll get SunView programs instead    of OpenWindows ones!    Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that /usr/openwin/lib is last, after the X11    library directory.This doesn't matter with OpenWindows 3.0, but with    older versions you'll get error messages from X11 programs if you don't    do this.  The messages are generally harmless (see next item), although    xdm core dumps if this isn't right.    Set OPENWINHOME to the directory containing OpenWindows if it isn't    /usr/openwin.

You must be running OpenWindows to use AnswerBook.It won't run under    X11 (on an X terminal or on anything else) because it uses NeWS to draw    the PostScript text and pictures.    If you are using OpenWindows 3.0, you need to use the OpenWindows 3.0    compatible navigator; it's called .navigator.ow3 on the AnswerBook CD/ROM.    If all AnswerBook users are using OpenWindows 3.0, you can replace    navigator wih .navigator.ow3 altogether (rename the old one first to    satisfy your sense of paranoia!)    The navigator.ow3 binary is also on CD/Ware Vol 2.    Note that the data files are in PostScript, so you can look at them with    a PostSript viewer (q.v.).@ Why aren't there any fish in realxfishdb?

("colormap flashing")        This is becasue most hardware can only display a few colors at a time.    However, you can minimise the effect with the following procedure:    *  Start all the applications with colors that you wish to reserve.    *  Runcmap_compact save       to create the .owcolors file    *  Put the linecmap_compact init       near the start of your start-up file (.xinitrc)    *  Exit and then restart the window system.    *  cmap_compact init will push those colors .owcolors to the end ofthe colormap and reserves them.    Also note that control-L2 locks the colors of the current window, and    Control-L4 unlocks them -- this is described in the olwm manual page.@ pageiew uses the wrong colors, or makes the colormap flash (see above):    This problem was reported by people for some reason running the Motif    window manager (mwm) with OpenWindows.

Use /etc/setsid to start your command tools and all will be well.    SunView applications may need to be run with svenv, as insvenv -exec /usr/bin/traffic    because xdm won't set the necessary environment variables.

This is fineunder OpenWindows, but many X11 servers have font problems)    HELPPATH  Where XView looks when you press the Help key (or F1)/usr/openwin/lib/locale:/usr/openwin/lib/help(On SunOS 4.0.*, or with OpenWindows 2.0, omit the first entry, whichis for sites using a local other than "C" or "USA").

XView 3.0 is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu and    elsewhere.    MoOLIT can be bought from AT&T in source form.    OpenWindows can be obtained from Sun, or you can get the source from    Interactive Systems Inc.  It is also included in some vendors' System V    Release 4 implementations, although that's not always the latest version.    The current release of OpenWindows from Sun for supported architectures    is 3.0; for the Sun 3 series it is frozen at OpenWindows 2.0.    Note that Sun includes OpenWindows with SunOS, and it is also included as    the windowing system for Solaris.    There are said (by Sun) to be over 35 ports of OpenWindows either    available now or in progress.  Unfortunately, none of them seem to    be available from anywhere.

Sun also supplies a large amount of documentation with OpenWindows,    although you may have to order it separately.  Here's what I have; they    are each a little over 21 cm square (wider than A4 paper), and vary from    about 1 cm to about 3cm thick.  They say `User's Guide' or `Programmer's    Guide' on the front.

AT&T includes several large thorny bushes' worth of paper with OLIT.    Sun's AnswerBook CD/ROM contains a lot of the above documentation,    including some of the O'Reilly books (not the XView 3 Volume 7, though).    Volume 8 of the O'Reilly series is about X Administration, and mentions    OpenWindows, although it is primarily aimed at X11R5.

LabsDate: Sat, 17 Apr 93 01:00:06 GMTLines: 50I am working on a project to provide an emergency managementinformation system.  In keeping with more classic command andcontrol type systems, we are considering developing a dual screen monitorsystem in order to provide a status board on it's own monitor.  I have a number of X level questions regarding this:(We are devloping on Unix systems using X/Motif. Platform will be predominantly Sun's, probably with ports to RS/6000 as well).I am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configuredsuch that we are talking about one X display and multiple screens,and not multiple X displays.   Given this:- Is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simpleas tracking your mouse from one screen to the other?  There'snothing special that needs to be done to shift focus betweenscreens?- Do I have to run separate window managers on the separatescreens or are there multiscreen window managers out there?What are they; who sells them...- Is a multi-screen window manager the only way I can grab awindow frame and move a window from one screen to the next?- Is there any way for the application to transparently seemultiple screens as one logical x-y plane, or does the hardwareonly provide for each screen to start at 0,0?- Any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing asystem capable of using either multiple screens or a singlescreen (perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulatemultiple screens instead)?  I am assuming that this is not a major issue - that I can relyon providing config files which will specify for eachconfiguration the screen placement of each window in theapplication.

Soa "hourglass" cursor should be shown when the application is busy, or a"caution" cursor should be shown over an area when input is expected inanother. Defining cursors for widgets has to be done at rather low level.So defining a cursor for all widgets in an application but not for a certainsubpart of it, is a rather complicated matter. When cursors have been definedfor some windows, e.g. a "crosswire" cursor for a DrawingArea, things get evenmore complicated. My intuition says that things should be easier, but is thisso? If anyone has a solid and complete solution to my problem, please let meknow.

For example, incorrectEnglish constructs such as "its raining" or "it's window id" annoy me.However, there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the waythings really are in the world. Indeed, the fact that X won out over NeWSwas really down to popular opinion (I know, we all think it's(!) technicallysuperior as well!).On a related topic, who is to say that "color" is more or less correctthan "colour" - being Irish, and hence using English English as opposedto American English, I always use the latter except, of course, for APIterms such as "XAllocColor" and "colormap".In a world that uses the term "Windows" to refer to Microsoft Windows,perhaps the time has come to accept "X Windows" as a valid term for X.I think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than, say,"the X Window System" and, let's face it, almost everyone uses it.Ultimately, we all need product sales to more than just X-literatepeople. In this respect, product recognition is important and a short,snappy, descriptive title ("X" is positively obscure) will helpwhen dealing with the average punter (it's sad - I thought I was asoftware engineer!). Indeed it is unfortunate that X did not becomepopularly known as Windows and let MS worry about whether it shouldbe called "Microsoft Windows" or "the Microsoft Window System" orhow about just plain "Microsoft"!To summarise (or should that be "summarize") the point of this message:I think there are far more pressing issues facing the X community thanworrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system(or should that be "windowing system"). Whatever gets recognised isfine by me. I agree that one should be careful in interpreting whattrade papers say. However, I would be reluctant to come to thisconclusion purely on the basis of how they name the X Window System.Gerard O'Driscoll (gerard.odriscoll@dps.co.uk)Du Pont Pixel Systems Ltd.

Asher                                          Yes, Xhibition is for the X Window System.  The X Window System Conference remains the largest and most complete conference devoted to X.  Nineteen fulland half day tutorials and thirty-six technical sessions over three daysprovide huge amounts of information for X application developers.  Add vendorexhibits and a Product Presentation track to provide information on whatfolks can purchase today, and you have a complete show focused on X11.Speakers at Xhibition 93 include:   Bob Schiefler, Lu Abel, Mark Ackerman, Paul Asente, Doug Blewett,   Donna Converse, Jim Fulton, Oliver Jones, Keith Packard, Ralph Swick,   Doug Young, and many others.Xhibition is growing (fortunately for us:-) and we have added some additionalconferences.  Surveys that we have given have indicated additional topics ofinterest.  These include: object oriented technologies such as the ObjectManagement Group's ORB and CORBA; C++ as it applies to X; client servertechnologies such as DCE; threads; databases- object oriented and relational;and (not surprisingly when you look at the audience) Windows NT.With the bulk of the Xhibition audience (and the UNIX community) developingapplications for in-house or custom use, a new 32-bit operating system from aplayer as large as Microsoft needs to be evaluated. With MS Windows on so manydesktops, and the price of computing power dropping, its successor needs to beevaluated.  As corporations begin to look at NT, so must their developers andsuppliers.The mission of the Xhibition technical conferences is to provide informationto the application developer and to the technology planner.  The NT Conferenceat Xhibition is designed to do just that.  We worked with Microsoft to providethe *only* conference this year specifically designed to show X and UNIXdevelopers the capabilities of Windows and NT.  If you aren't sure that NT haswhat you need for your application development or systems deployment, this isthe place to find out.  Ask the folks from Microsoft, get them to show youwhat you need.  Conference attendees will receive NT Software DevelopmentKits- to bang on, evaluate, and generally to see for yourself.I hope this doesn't sound like an NT commercial (it should sound like anXhibition commercial:-).  I just want to reiterate that the Xhibition audienceis growing and Xhibition is growing along with it.  The industry is aconfusing place at the moment with UNIX, COSE, NT, DCE, CORBA, and all ofthe other acronyms sprouting up.

We use xdm (X11R4) to manage the displays.When we had 3 xkernel machines, things worked fine, but whenwe installed 4 more last weekend, we appear to have found a weakness.With 7 clients to 1 Sparc 2, the Sparc 2 window manager is eventuallygetting munged.  Let me try to be precise:  The user sitting at the machinethat does all the actual processing for these xterminals is havingcontrol of his keyboard and screen yanked away.  (When this was thedepartment chair, it was kind of cute).  We poked at xdm for a fewdays and are satisfied that it is not at fault.  Our current theory isthat olwm (the Sun version) was not meant for running multiple copieson one machine (which is what happens -- the console user runs olwm,and every xterminal logged in has olwm running on the xterminalserver). Has anyone had any prior experience with this sort of behavior?Can anyone shoot obvious holes in this theory?How about obvious gimmes?And, of course, any ideas on how to solve it?Any ideas are greatly appreciated.

Use a workProc.  See XtAppAddWorkProc(3Xt).You should split your drawing routnie up into small chunks (thisis the hard part).  Then, in the callback that starts the drawing,you call XtAppAddWorkProc() to call your workProc the first time. Your workProc should be a function that returns a boolean...TRUE when you are finished, and FALSE when you want to keepprocessing.  If you return FALSE, the workProc is automaticallyre-installed.  Note that this method is better that using a time-out loop, sinceevents get processed in a more precedence-oriented manner.

If you really want Tom to replyyou should send mail to support@qdeck.com.A 64k line is certainly going to restrict you far more than the 10mbpsethernet that we typically run.  How restrictive it will be depends on what you run and how you run it.  I would think that a couple of instancesof some really nasty program like "Smoking Clover" would make the link useless for anyone else.  On the other hand, probably 50 xclocks quietlyupdating every 10 seconds or so wouldn't impact it too much.  In the realworld, you will be somewhere in between these two extremes.Going by the way I personally use X on a daily basis, I wouldn't want to haveto share that 64k link with more than 3-4 other people.>>Having said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding>>in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of>>thing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before>>you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth).>>Hmmm.

What size link do you have (2Mb or 10Mb ?).>What is the average traffic flow going through your network or do you>have few high peaks and then many low points?Our corporate WAN is as unique as any other.  The usage patterns are not verygood predictors of how yours will behave.  The only one of our low bandwidthlinks that normally get used in this way is a 56k link to Ireland that theyoften use to run a DOS text based client end of a client-server database remotely from the DVX machine behind me. Since the server end is (or was) alwaysat this end (California) it is faster to remotely run the client via DESQviewX and have a short hop to the server than running the client locally and havinga long hop to the server.  As I warned you, this tells us very little abouthow you usage pattern will fill a 64k ISDN link.Running Word for Windows remotely is going to itself be very usage dependent.Let's break it into pieces and look at it.  Tracking the mouse pointer is easyand efficient to translate from Windows calls into X. Popping up a menu is alittle more involved and will generate some traffic.  Restoring the screenthat was covered by that menu may be easy and may not be.  Does the serverthat it's displaying on have backing store?  If so and the server had enoughmemory the display can be updated locally and will generate little networktraffic. If no backing store, then what was being covered up?  If it was a solid colored rectangle of space we can tell your xserver to draw that quiteeasily.  If it was a full color backdrop of Ren & Stimpy we may have to sendit back to the X server bit by bit.  DVX will do its level best to only redrawthat small area, but in some unusual cases the entire screen may need to be repainted.  Assuning a 1024x768 screen with 4 bits per pixel that's 3145728 bitsthat has to be sent.  Worst possible case you're looking at about 50 seconds.In reality it would never be this bad since the screen will always have parts that will be tranlatable into higher level X calls.>>>>It all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going>>to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all>>doing network things also...)>>-- >>What do you mean by network things?  I vision using MS Windows and other>Windows applications over the network were the processes are running on>the server and all I am getting are the displays.  I am wondering how >good is the X and subsequently DV/X protocol in transferring these >images with X-calls and displaying them on a client's machine.X was designed from the ground up to be efficient across a network.  It's pretty good for this.  X programs are best, DOS text programs are almostas good (since we conert them to X easily).  Something like WinX is a hybrid.We intercept the calls Windows makes to it's graphics driver/ mouse driverkeyboard driver and convert them to X.  The calls Windows is making are inno way designed to be efficient on a packet switched network.  We go to a lot of trouble to convert them to the highes level Xlib calls we can, butwe are somewhat limited because we only know what Windows and its applicationstell us.+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+|   Quarterdeck Office Systems                    ____________________/_   ||         Gary Rich - Problem Resolution Dept.    _________________///__\\  ||  _____________________________________________  ______________/////___\\  ||   Anonymous FTP site = qdeck.com                ___________///////____\\  ||          ---For---          ---Write to---      ________/////////_____\\  ||    Pricing/Ordering info :  info@qdeck.com      _____///////////______\\  ||     Technical Questions  : support@qdeck.com    __/////////////_______\\  ||         Quarterdeck BBS - (310) 314-3227        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\  |+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

It should be possible to filterthe mouse and keyboard events from the server's queuean to store them in a file.This sequence of events, stored in a file, should be given to the server's queue as if a user is working.1. Exists a tool that is capable to save and reply all   mouse and keyboard events (where)?2. Where one can catch these events to store them ?   In our case the server's queue is on a X Terminal (HP).   Where can we catch all events coming from a given   server.   If this is not possible, can we catch all events given   to a certain client and how ?   3. Where one can send a stored sequence of events to simulate a user ?   Is there a central dispatcher on the clients machine who manages   all incoming events from a given server and how can we reach it ?Thanks in advanceRon.

Similarly,   there was a demonstrated need for an information and discussion forum   for SCO products in general.      With the increasing demand for accessibility and for additional SCO   newsgroups, many current contributors including those who have been   active in circulating SCO related newsgroups and mailing lists felt   that the readership would be best served by creating a biz.sco.*   hierarchy to improve propagation (and hence availability) worldwide.   biz.sco.{opendesktop,general,announce} were newgrouped May 1, 1991 in   accordance with accepted procedure within "biz".  Given the content,   this change relocated the "opendesktop" newsgroup to a more proper place   within the established usenet news hierarchy and adds the new "announce"   and "general" groups.  On Aug 1, 1991, the former "sco-list@uunet.uu.net"   became "scogen" in keeping with established biz.sco.* naming conventions.   biz.sco.binaries and biz.sco.sources were newgrouped on June 1, 1992   to respectively accommodate SCO Xenix, UNIX and OpenDesktop specific   binaries and source code.  The binaries and sources news groups are   moderated, with moderator and submissions information and policy   outlined in the periodic imformational postings in those newsgroups.   Respecting USENET etiquite, these newsgroups are _not_ gated to   mailing lists, but are archived on several nuucp and ftp hosts.   biz.sco.magazine was newgrouped Dec 14, 1992, to provide a discussion   area for the readers, writers and publishers of SCO Magazine.      Subject to the USENET NEWS hierarchies carried by your upstream feed,   you are now able to subscribe to the following:           Newsgroup                    mailing list subscription        ---------                    -------------------------        biz.sco.opendesktop          scoodt-request@xenitec.on.ca        biz.sco.general              scogen-request@xenitec.on.ca        biz.sco.announce             scoann-request@xenitec.on.cabiz.sco.sources<none>biz.sco.binaries<none>biz.sco.magazine     scomag-request@xenitec.on.ca   You are _strongly_ encouraged to obtain these newsgroups via USENET   NEWS mechanisms vrs mail.  Anyone having difficulty arranging a news   feed for these newsgroups is welcome to email the undersigned and   I'll do my best to help.  We also offer all required software in   source code form via anonymous FTP and UUCP, as do many archive sites.   If, after having explored all options, you are still unable to receive   biz.sco.* as news, you may subscribe to the mailing lists.      The 4 discussion newsgroups are bi-directionally gated to companion   mailing lists, so anyone not having access to NEWS but who does have a   UUCP or Internet mail feed can still participate fully using email.   Mailing list subscribers should send their request to the appropriate   "mailing list subscription" address above, including in the message body:Add: subscriber_address-eg-Add: your_logname@site.do.main  -or-Add: up!stream!yoursite!your_logname   Inclusion of an alternative working bang-path relative to a well know   major functional site might prove beneficial.  Deletions are handled   the same way, simply substitute "Delete:" for "Add:", ensuring that   you use the exact same address you subscribed with.  Mailing list   subscribers receive "how to post to the mlist" article submission   information when their request is processed.  If you don't receive   an acknowledgement within a few days, check your routing and try a test   message via xenitec.on.ca back to your host.  In such cases, it's likely   that someone, somewhere, is bouncing mail replies to you (and would do   the same with mailing list traffic), and you'll want to resolve your   connectivity problem before trying to subscribe again.  Mailing list   subscriptions are free, subject to whatever arrangements you may have   with the site(s) feeding you.      Should you receive no response or experience a sudden and prolonged   drop to zero volume on one of the mailing lists, this indicates that we   are no longer able to find a working route to your site.  We loose a   handful of subscribers this way each month.  If this happens to you,   please email us your known working bang-path relative to a major site.   What's in the newsgroups (and mailing_lists where applicable):      biz.sco.opendesktop: Technical questions and answers and informative                        postings relating to past, present, and future                        implementations of the SCO OpenDeskTop operating                        environment and it's various bundled components.      biz.sco.general:     Questions, answers and comments on SCO products                        in general, and of course resulting discussions.      biz.sco.announce:    SCO and SCO Developer product announcements ofinterest to current and future users of SCO products,and to SCO developers, resellers and distributors.
