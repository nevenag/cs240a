Furthermore, its promotion asproviding greater protection than bare voice is quite true, as faras it goes.  However, the only way for it to fulfill its stated goalof letting LE wiretap "terrorists and drug dealers" is to restrictstronger techniques.  Wiretap targets presently use strong encryption, weak encryption, or(the vast majority) no encryption.  The latter two classes can betapped.  With weak encryption in every phone, the no-encryptionclass is merged into the weak-encryption class.  Will theintroduction of Clipper cause targets presently enjoying strongprivacy to give up on it?  that is, to rely for privacy on a systemexpressly designed to deny it to people like them?  I doubt it.  Themere introduction of this scheme will give the government *nothing*.The stated goal of preventing the degradation of wiretappingcapabilities can be fulfilled by restriction of domesticcryptography, and only by this restriction.  "Clipper" appears to beno more than a sop, given to the public to mute any complaints.  Wewould find this a grossly inadequate tradeoff, but I fear the publicat large will not care.  I hate to even mention gun control, butmost people seem to think that an `assault weapon' (as the NYT usesthe word) is some sort of automatic weapon, .50 caliber maybe.

(email: fw@world.std.com)My thanks to the people who responded, both on usenet and fromOracle Corp.The most common response was to suggest use of oracle audit features or OPS$ passwords to control access (opinion on OPS$included suggestions to use and not use). I was also advised to use table views to refine the granularity of access control.One important security consideration in networked installationsis that OPS$ accounts presume that the client host provides userauthentication. Os/2 server OPS$ users are only as secure as the _least_ secure machine on the network. Hence you should probably not define any OPS$ accounts on systems with PC's, or limit access of OPS$ accounts to data with no security concerns. Unix oracle servers provide for disabling OPS$ access over the network (orasrvoption), while relying on host security for local processes. Internally Oracle provides powerful and well documented (sic) audit mechanisms which the DBA will use to monitor system anddata access. These tools can be used to track the primary securityrisks from within the Oracle environment.Oracle password security is based on a proprietary usage of DESencryption. Oracle Corp. states that the algorithm is not proneto cleartext attack. This is a difficult claim to substantiate since the algorithm is unknown. The concern here is that if users choose easily guessed passwords. _If_ a cracker can gain access to your oracle database files through the host operating system, s/he could extract the 'cyphertext' password data and apply cryptanalysis techniques to learn the users passwords.As security risks go, the above scenario is pretty low severity.Certainly once an intruder has access to the raw database files,s/he can access to the data in them. If a cracker _could_ break the passwords, however, s/he could do substantial damage withoutalerting the auditing mechanism's, and leaving and audit trailwhich would point to valid users. At present Oracle (like Unix)provides no native means of ensuring that passwords are not guessable. As with all computer security, the most important defense is to educate users in the safe choice of passwords. These techniquesare well discussed in internet rfc#1281 and the Crack manual, (both available from ftp archive servers) and, UNIX(R) System Security (Curry, David A. - Addison-Welsey 1992) Forrest Whitcher                 fw@world.std.comBoston Scientific Corp.

Gov isn't probablystrong enough or foolish enough to prevent strong crypt.  Theyare strong enough, and we may be foolish enough, to push throughthe Clipper Chip.Is RSA independt of the gov enough to spearhead this?

Well, who cares.First let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about theClipper-Chip, from what Hellman and Denning were able to tell us:The chip itself is not confined to (digital) telephony, but performsgeneral encryption in a symmetric manner.  The chip supports CFB OFBECB (and whatever the fourth mode of operation for DES is), the algorithmconsists of 32 rounds of *whatever*, and takes 80-Bit keys. Input dataseems to be 64 Bit? Yes.So if two people want secure communication (whatever that means when Clipper is involved) they have first to agree on ONE secret key. (Or is it one key per direction ?)They can exchange this key via DH-schemes or however.Somehow the two feed their so won secret key into the Clipper-chipwhich is now ready to work.The clipper chip carries an unique Serial-Number (30 Bit's), and 160 Key-Bits.These 160 key-bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial-numberwith 160 seed-bits. (The seed-bits seem not to be stored in the chip)At beginning of communication (and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin??)before sending the fist real 64-bit output of the first encryption the Clipperchip put's out packets (I guess 3) which represent the serial number,and the session key. This might look likeX{ E[K; chipkeyK1+K2], serial number}where X is a transformation of these 3? Packets involving a family-key.This family(sp?)-key is equal for ALL chips. (X might be a simple XOR ???)After that, the (digital?) phone-call can be done as usual, every packetbeing encrypted and decrypted by Clipper.Denning describes how K1 and K2 shall be generated, using a seed of 160Bit's.Now, leaving alone politics, which does not concern me as much as you, notbeing an American Citicien(tm) [ :-) ] , there are some weak points in thisscheme, which might be exploited by several parties.As far as I know about the generation of K1,K2 ; S1 and S2 look like the obvious backdoor. They could be used to generate the chip-keys by knowingthe serial-number (and also the family-key) of the chip. I really can'timagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise, as true random-sourcesfor the generation of the K1,K2 can be bought for not to much money.Then, the escrows. Each of them will get 80 bit of a 160-Bit key. Securitycould (as little as existant) be maximized by giving them 160-bitseach, which have to be xored together to give the K1,K2. Now let's simplyassume the escrows are trustworthy, and can't be fooled by criminals orlaw enforchemnt agencies. (And there will be no quarrel between escrowsand l.e.a which would hinder the l.e.a in doing their duties, and so onand so on) Once the keys are surrendered, the correspondingchip is compromised forever. Not very clever, IMHO [ :-)) ].How about sending in the encrypted session-keys for each phone-call thatthe police (or whoever) want's to listen to? Escrows could then simply decodethis session-key and send it back to police. (And would naturally not do thisafter the warrant has expired...) This would be a better technical solution,but I guess politics will not work that way.Apparently (as Miss Dennings stated) the only one performing actually decodesof intercepted messages shall be the FBI. Great. So local guys can not inter-cept (understand) your traffic anymore. Does this mean that the FBI monopolizesthe right to do legal wiretaps ? (How is law over there, I have no idea whois allowed to tap, and who not) This certainly means that watched communi-cations will be routed automatically from the service-providing companyto the FBI, if the communicaiton is a watched one. And this means as faras I understand it that the family-key has to be known by each switching-company, and those providing cellular-phone servies etcetc. So the family-keywill not be very secret, and thus serial-numbers of calls will be readableby anybody who cares. I _like_ traffic-analysis!What do you guess, what happens, if you use the chip in ECB mode, and thefirst few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled? So the sessionkey would not be actually broadcasted over the line? Hmmm. Shouldn't be sodifficult to do *that* :^)And now a last point, for the other side. After all I have read and heard aboutClipper (not the programming language for dBase, is it ? [:-)]) it seemsto have many advantages, which shold not be overseen!Now an afterthought to your rights.

It gives police the power to putinnocent people in jail because they (the police) find something they don'tunderstand.  Most police don't know what the return key does, never mind thedifference between a core file and classified military secrets.There are plenty of scenarios where the user would have no idea what somethingis either.  It could be uninitialized junk.  The burden of proof is on theuser to show that it's something a normal upstanding citizen should have.  Noone should ever be put in that situation, especially in America.What's disgusting about this is how easily most people go along with it, toprovide a bargaining chip against some hypothetical *alleged* child molesteror drug dealer, or whatever bad thing is in style at the time.  Basically mostpeople don't have a clear distinction between criminals and suspects.As an analogy, it's like they find a loose screw in your house, and theyinsist that you're building a bomb or machine gun.  They ask you where it camefrom (like you'd know), and ask you to prove your claim.  When you explain itin such simple terms, people may start to get the idea.As a matter of fact, i do keep random files on my disk.  The reason is,without special-purpose hardware, it takes a long time to generate good randombits.  I have programs that crank out a couple bits per minute, which ispretty conservative, but over time that's more than i need.If you think about it, there's no point in actually encrypting random data,because it just gives you different random data.  If you want some data tolook like an encrypted file, you just put an appropriate header on it.  Ifenough people do this, some of them will be put in jail.When you get arrested and the police ask for your keys, you can tell them it'sjust random junk, although of course they won't believe you.  While you'resitting in jail, you can take consolation in the fact that the government willburn a few CPU-years trying to find something that's not there.--Joe Keane, amateur cryptologistjgk@osc.com (uunet!amdcad!osc!jgk)

The US government could probably>stop importation of clone hardware, but a software implementation>should be practical.Amusing thought: could they have employed an algorythm which is infeasablefor a fast software implementation, but which is easy in custom hardware?In DES, the extensive use of permutation tables (trivial in hardware: youjust swap bus lines), but relatively slow in software have had a big effecton the speed difference between hardware and software implementations ofthat cipher (indeed, I suspect that Lucifer's designers were well aware thatit would be, and approved.)  Certain algorythms (usually parallel searchalgorythms) can be very slow in software, yet can fly in custom hardware.I have no proof of their employment in Clipper -- it is pure conjecture.  However, as a software implementation of this cipher is something that its designers would have been trying to avoid at all costs, then the inclusion of such techniques seems credible.Hmmm... I also wonder what Intergraph thinks about the use of the name"Clipper" for this device. :)--Ian Farquhar                      Phone : + 61 2 805-9400Office of Computing Services      Fax   : + 61 2 805-7433Macquarie University  NSW  2109   Also  : + 61 2 805-7420Australia                         EMail : ifarqhar@laurel.ocs.mq.edu.au.

Rather than use technology to accommodatethe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy andlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government againstindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years toprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used toprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryptiontechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and theunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be usedby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the "Clipper Chip" hasbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents anew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached toan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communicationsusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many incommercial use today.This new technology will help companies protect proprietaryinformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversationsand prevent unauthorized release of data transmittedelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves theability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies tointercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. A "key-escrow" system will be established to ensure that the"Clipper Chip" is used to protect the privacy of law-abidingAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                2"keys," numbers that will be needed by authorized governmentagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When thedevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separatelyin two "key-escrow" data bases that will be established by theAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited togovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct awiretap.The "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with nonew authorities to access the content of the privateconversations of Americans.To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, theAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the newdevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside thegovernment will be offered access to the confidential details ofthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly reporttheir findings.The chip is an important step in addressing the problem ofencryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect theprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shieldcriminals and terrorists.  We need the "Clipper Chip" and otherapproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with accessto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using itto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technologytrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),the President has directed government agencies to develop acomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone          calls and data, under proper court or other legal          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern          technology to build the National Information          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and          the competitiveness of American industry in the global          marketplace; and      --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export          high technology products.The President has directed early and frequent consultations withaffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate theprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                3The Administration is committed to working with the privatesector to spur the development of a National InformationInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computertechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access toinformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks("information superhighways") will transmit video, images, HDTVprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephonesystem transmits voice.Since encryption technology will play an increasingly importantrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must actquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regardingits use.  The Administration is committed to policies thatprotect all Americans' right to privacy while also protectingthem from those who break the law.Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the newencryption technology are also available.  For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute ofStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.- - ---------------------------------QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'STELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVEQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?A:   No.  "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with     no new authorities to access the content of the private     conversations of Americans.Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to     decipher the message?A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They     would then present documentation of this authorization to     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key     escrow system.Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will     oversee the key-escrow data banks.Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure     how strong the security is?  A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all     potential users that there are no unrecognized     vulnerabilities.Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet     officials.Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the     decisions related to this initiative.Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?A:   The government designed and developed the key access     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip     manufacturer that produces them.Q:   Who provides the "Clipper Chip"?A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed     to other vendors in the future.Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating     the "Clipper Chip" into their devices.     Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more     powerful encryption devices?A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive     than others readily available today, but it is just one     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to     encryption technology, which the Administration is     developing.     The Administration is not saying, "since encryption     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,     we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries have     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that "every     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an     unbreakable commercial encryption product."  There is a     false "tension" created in the assessment that this issue is     an "either-or" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,     balanced approach such as is proposed with the "Clipper     Chip" and similar encryption techniques.Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from     that of the Bush Administration?  A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption     technology in telecommunications and computing and are     committed to working with industry and public-interest     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime     and terrorism.Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use     the government hardware?A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability     of these products.

The parts aremostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answersevery 21 days.Contents:* What is a product cipher?* What makes a product cipher secure?* What are some group-theoretic properties of product ciphers?* What can be proven about the security of a product cipher?* How are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size?* Can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication?* What exactly is DES?* What is triple DES?* What is differential cryptanalysis?* How was NSA involved in the design of DES?* Is DES available in software?* Is DES available in hardware?* Can DES be used to protect classified information?* What are "ECB", "CBC", "CFB", and "OFB" encryption?* What is a product cipher?  A product cipher is a block cipher that iterates several weak  operations such as substitution, transposition, modular  addition/multiplication, and linear transformation. (A ``block  cipher'' just means a cipher that encrypts a block of data---8 bytes,  say---all at once, then goes on to the next block.) The notion of  product ciphers is due to Shannon [SHA49]. Examples of modern  product ciphers include LUCIFER [SOR84], DES [NBS77], SP-networks  [KAM78], LOKI [BRO90], FEAL [SHI84], PES [LAI90], Khufu and Khafre  [ME91a]. The so-called Feistel ciphers are a class of product  ciphers which operate on one half of the ciphertext at each round,  and then swap the ciphertext halves after each round. LUCIFER,  DES, LOKI, and FEAL are examples of Feistel ciphers.  The following table compares the main parameters of several product   ciphers:  cipher   |   block length   |   key bits   |   number of rounds  LUCIFER          128               128                16  DES               64                56                16  LOKI              64                64                16  FEAL              64               128            2^x, x >= 5  PES               64               128                 8* What makes a product cipher secure?  Nobody knows how to prove mathematically that a product cipher is  completely secure. So in practice one begins by demonstrating that the  cipher ``looks highly random''. For example, the cipher must be  nonlinear, and it must produce ciphertext which functionally depends  on every bit of the plaintext and the key. Meyer [MEY78] has shown  that at least 5 rounds of DES are required to guarantee such a  dependence. In this sense a product cipher should act as a ``mixing''  function which combines the plaintext, key, and ciphertext in a  complex nonlinear fashion.  The fixed per-round substitutions of the product cipher are  referred to as S-boxes. For example, LUCIFER has 2 S-boxes, and DES  has 8 S-boxes. The nonlinearity of a product cipher reduces to a  careful design of these S-boxes. A list of partial design criteria  for the S-boxes of DES, which apply to S-boxes in general, may be  found in Brown [BRO89] and Brickell et al. [BRI86].* What are some group-theoretic properties of product ciphers?  Let E be a product cipher that maps N-bit blocks to N-bit blocks.  Let E_K(X) be the encryption of X under key K. Then, for any fixed K,  the map sending X to E_K(X) is a permutation of the set of N-bit  blocks. Denote this permutation by P_K. The set of all N-bit  permutations is called the symmetric group and is written S_{2^N}.  The collection of all these permutations P_K, where K ranges over all  possible keys, is denoted E(S_{2^N}). If E were a random mapping from  plaintexts to ciphertexts then we would expect E(S_{2^N}) to generate  a large subset of S_{2^N}.  Coppersmith and Grossman [COP74] have shown that a very simple  product cipher can generate the alternating group A_{2^N} given a  sufficient number of rounds. (The alternating group is half of the  symmetric group: it consists of all ``even'' permutations, i.e., all  permutations which can be written as an even number of swaps.)  Even and Goldreich [EVE83] were able to extend these results to show  that Feistel ciphers can generate A_{2^N}, given a sufficient number  of rounds.  The security of multiple encipherment also depends on the  group-theoretic properties of a cipher. Multiple encipherment is an  extension over single encipherment if for keys K1, K2 there does  not exist a third key K3 such that  E_K2(E_K1(X)) == E_(K3)(X)                (**)  which indicates that encrypting twice with two independent keys  K1, K2 is equal to a single encryption under the third key K3.  If  for every K1, K2 there exists a K3 such that eq. (**) is true then  we say that E is a group.  This question of whether DES is a group under this definition was  extensively studied by Sherman, Kaliski, and Rivest [SHE88]. In their  paper they give strong evidence for the hypothesis that DES is not a  group. In fact DES is not a group [CAM93].* What can be proven about the security of a product cipher?  Recall from above that P_K is a permutation produced by E under  some key K. The goal of the designer of E is to ensure that P_K  appears to be a random element of S_{2^N}, the symmetric group.  Let R be an element of S_{2^N} selected randomly. We will say that P_K  and R are indistinguishable if an observer given P_K and R in some  order cannot distinguish between these two permutations in polynomial  time. That is, with time bounded resources, the observer cannot  determine which of the permutations is produced by E: the optimal  decision is no better than simply guessing.  Luby and Rackoff [LUB88] have shown that a class of Feistel ciphers  are secure in this sense when the round mapping is replaced by  random boolean functions.* How are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size?  There are four standard "modes of operation" (and numerous non-standard  ones as well).  The standard modes of operation are defined in the U.S.  Department of Commerce Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 81,  published in 1980.  See the question about "ECB" below for more details.  Although they are defined for the DES block cipher, the "modes of  operation" can be used with any block cipher.* Can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication?  One may use a symmetric cryptosystem block cipher to prove to himself  that he did or did not generate a message, and to prove to himself   whether his message was altered or unaltered since generation.  But one  cannot prove these things to another without revealing the key, and   thereafter that key cannot be used to prove anything about any messages  that were authenticated using that key.    See ANSI X3.106-1983 and FIPS 113 (1985) for a standard method of message  authentication using DES.* What exactly is DES?  DES is the U.S. Government's Data Encryption Standard - a product   cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks of data, using a 56-bit key.    It is defined in FIPS 46-1 (1988) [which supersedes FIPS 46 (1977)].  FIPS are Federal Information Processing Standards published by NTIS.  DES is identical to the ANSI standard Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA)  defined in ANSI X3.92-1981. * What is triple DES?  Triple DES is a product cipher which, like DES, operates on 64-bit   data blocks.  There are several forms, each of which uses the DES  cipher 3 times.  Some forms use two 56-bit keys, some use three.  The "DES modes of operation" may also be used with triple-DES.  Some people refer to E(K1,D(K2,E(K1,x))) as triple-DES.  This method is defined in chapter 7.2 of the ANSI standard X9.17-1985  "Financial Institution Key Management" and is intended for use in  encrypting DES keys and IVs for "Automated Key Distribution".  Its  formal name is "Encryption and Decryption of a Single Key by a Key  Pair", but it is referenced in other standards documents as EDE.  That standard says (section 7.2.1): "Key encrypting keys may be a single  DEA key or a DEA key pair.  Key pairs shoud be used where additional  security is needed (e.g., the data protected by the key(s) has a long  security life).  A key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a  single key."  Others use the term "triple-DES" for E(K1,D(K2,E(K3,x))) or  E(K1,E(K2,E(K3,x))).  One of us (Carl Ellison) keeps advocating DES triple use in the form  E(K1, TRAN( E(K2, TRAN( E(K3, COMPRESS( x )))))), where each DES instance  has its own key and IV (for CBC mode) and TRAN has been posted on  sci.crypt.  (It is a large-block transposition program taking its key  from the data stream itself, so that it is not an encryption program on  its own part.)* What is differential cryptanalysis?  Differential cryptanalysis is a statistical attack that can be  applied to any iterated mapping (ie. any mapping which is based on  a repeated round function). The method was recently popularized by  Biham and Shamir [BIH91], but Coppersmith has remarked that the  S-boxes of DES were optimized against this attack some 20 years ago.  This method has proved effective against several product ciphers,  notably FEAL [BI91a].  Differential cryptanalysis is based on observing a large number of  ciphertexts Y, Y' whose corresponding plaintexts X, X' satisfy a  known difference D = X+X', where + is componentwise XOR. In the  basic Biham-Shamir attack, 2^{47} such plaintext pairs are required  to determine the key for DES. Substantially fewer pairs are required  if DES is truncated to 6 or 8 rounds. In these cases, the actual key  can be recovered in a matter of minutes using a few thousand pairs.  For full DES this attack is impractical because it requires so many  known plaintexts.  The work of Biham and Shamir on DES revealed several startling  observations on the algorithm. Most importantly, if the key  schedule was removed from DES and a 16*48 = 768-bit key was used,  the key could be recovered in less than 2^{64} steps. Thus  independent subkeys do not add substantial security to DES.  Further, the S-boxes of DES are extremely sensitive in that  changing even single entries in these tables yields significant  improvement in the differential attack.  Adi Shamir is quoted to say (NYTimes Oct 13 1991), ``I would say  that, contrary to what some people believe, there is no evidence  of tampering with the DES so that the basic design was weakened.''* How was NSA involved in the design of DES?  According to Kinnucan [KIN78], Tuchman, a member of the group that  developed DES at IBM is quoted as saying, ``We developed the DES  algorithm entirely within IBM using IBMers. The NSA did not  dictate a single wire!'' Tuchman and Meyer (another developer of  DES) spent a year breaking ciphers and finding weaknesses in  Lucifer. They then spent two years strengthening Lucifer. ``Their  basic approach was to look for strong substitution, permutation,  and key scheduling functions ... IBM has classified the notes  containing the selection criteria at the request of the NSA....  `The NSA told us we had inadvertently reinvented some of the deep  secrets it uses to make its own algorithms,' explains Tuchman.''    On the other hand, a document called ``Involvement of the NSA in  the development of DES: unclassified summary of the United States  Select Committee on Intelligence'', printed in the IEEE  Communications Magazine, p53-55, 1978, states: ``In the development  of DES, NSA convinced IBM that a reduced keysize was sufficient;  indirectly assisted in the development of the S-box structures; and  certified that the final DES algorithm was, to the best of their  knowledge, free from any statistical or mathematical weakness.''  Clearly the key size was reduced at the insistence of the NSA.  The article further states that the NSA did not tamper with the  algorithm itself, just the parameters, which in some sense  resolves the apparent conflict in the remarks of Meyer and Tuchman  presented above.* Is DES available in software?  Several people have made DES code available via ftp (see part 10 for  pathnames): Stig Ostholm [FTPSO]; BSD [FTPBK]; Eric Young [FTPEY];  Dennis Furguson [FTPDF]; Mark Riordan [FTPMR]; Phil Karn [FTPPK].  A Pascal listing of DES is also given in Patterson [PAT87].  FIPS 46-1 says "The algorithm specified in this standard is to be  implemented ... using hardware (not software) technology.  ...  Software implementations in general purpose computers are not in  compliance with this standard."  Despite this, software  implementations abound, and are used by government agencies.* Is DES available in hardware?  The following paragraphs are quoted from messages sent to the editors.  We don't vouch for the quality or even existence of the products.  Chip Rosenthal says: ``Dallas Semiconductor makes a DES  encryption/decryption device for use on standard, digital 64Kbps PCM  telecom data streams. It is capable of processing data in real time,  e.g. one sample/frame. It is the DS2160. Their phone number is  214-450-0400. You would probably need to talk with Dewight in Telecom  marketing.''  Christian Franke, franke@informatik.rwth-aachen.de, says: ``1.  Cryptech CRY12C102: 22.5Mbit/s according to Data Sheet, with 32 Bit  interface. We use this one, because it was the only one available when  we started the project. No problems !  2. Pijnenburg PCC100: 20Mbit/s  according to Data Sheet.

They can be reached at (613) 820-0024.* Can DES be used to protect classified information?  DES is not intended to protect classified data.  FIPS 46-1 says:  "This standard will be used by Federal departments and agencies for  the cryptographic protection of computer data when the following  conditions apply: 1.  ...  cryptographic protection is required; and  2. the data is not classified according to the National Security Act  of 1947, as amended, or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended."* What are "ECB", "CBC", "CFB", and "OFB" encryption?  These are methods for using block ciphers, such as DES, to encrypt   messages, files, and blocks of data, known as "modes of operation."  Four "modes of operation" are defined in FIPS 81 (1980 December 2),   and also in ANSI X3.106-1983.     FIPS 81 specifies that when 7-bit ASCII data is sent in octets, the  unused most-significant bit is to be set to 1.  FIPS 81 also specifies the padding for short blocks.  The four DES modes of operation are: Electronic Code Book  (ECB), Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), K-bit Cipher FeedBack (CFB), and K-bit Output FeedBack (OFB).  These methods are explained below in a c-language-like notation.  Some symbols:  P[n]The n'th block of plaintext, input to encryption, output from  decryption.  Size of block determined by the mode.  C[n]The n'th block of ciphertext, output from encryption, input to  decryption.  Size of block determined by the mode.  E(m)The DES encryption function, performed on 64-bit block m, using  the 16-key schedule derived from some 56-bit key.  D(m)The DES decryption function, performed on 64-bit block m, using  the same key schedule as in E(m), except that the 16 keys  in the schedule are used in the opposite order as in E(m).  IVA 64-bit "initialization vector", a secret value which, along with  the key, is shared by both encryptor and decryptor.  I[n]The n'th value of a 64-bit variable, used in some modes.  R[n]The n'th value of a 64-bit variable, used in some modes.  LSB(m,k) The k least significant (right-most) bits of m.  e.g.  m & ((1 << k) - 1)  MSB(m,k) The k most significant (left-most) bits of m.  e.g.  (m >> (64-k)) & ((1 << k) - 1)  = ^ << >> &  operators as defined in the c langage.  Electronic Code Book (ECB):    P[n] and C[n] are each 64-bits long.    Encryption:Decryption:    C[n] = E(P[n])P[n] = D(C[n])  Cipher Block Chaining (CBC):    P[n] and C[n] are each 64-bits long.    Encryption:Decryption:    C[0] = E(P[0]^IV)P[0] = D(C[0])^IV  (n>0)  C[n] = E(P[n]^C[n-1])P[n] = D(C[n])^C[n-1]  k-bit Cipher FeedBack (CFB):    P[n] and C[n] are each k bits long, 1 <= k <= 64.      Encryption:Decryption:    I[0] = IVI[0] = IV  (n>0)  I[n] = I[n-1]<<k | C[n-1]I[n] = I[n-1]<<k | C[n-1]  (all n) R[n] = MSB(E(I[n]),k)R[n] = MSB(E(I[n]),k)  (all n) C[n] = P[n]^R[n]P[n] = C[n]^R[n]    Note that for k==64, this reduces to:    I[0] = IVI[0] = IV  (n>0)  I[n] = C[n-1]I[n] = C[n-1]  (all n) R[n] = E(I[n])R[n] = E(I[n])  (all n) C[n] = P[n]^R[n]P[n] = C[n]^R[n]  CFB notes: Since I[n] depends only on the plain or cipher text from the  previous operation, the E() function can be performed in parallel with  the reception of the text with which it is used.  k-bit Output FeedBack (OFB):    P[n] and C[n] are each k bits long, 1 <= k <= 64.      Encryption:Decryption:    I[0] = IVI[0] = IV  (n>0)  I[n] = I[n-1]<<k | R[n-1]I[n] = I[n-1]<<k | R[n-1]  (all n) R[n] = MSB(E(I[n]),k)R[n] = MSB(E(I[n]),k)  (all n) C[n] = P[n]^R[n]P[n] = C[n]^R[n]    Note that for k==64, this reduces to:    I[0] = IVI[0] = IV  (n>0)  I[n] = R[n-1]I[n] = R[n-1]  (all n) R[n] = E(I[n])R[n] = E(I[n])  (all n) C[n] = P[n]^R[n]P[n] = C[n]^R[n]  OFB notes: encryption and decryption are identical.  Since I[n] is  independent of P and C, the E() function can be performed in advance of  the receipt of the plain/cipher text with which it is to be used.  Additional notes on DES "modes of operation":  ECB and CBC use E() to encrypt and D() to decrypt, but the feedback modes  use E() to both encrypt and decrypt.  This disproves the erroneous claim  that systems which feature E() but not D() cannot be used for data  confidentiality, and therefore are not subject to export controls.

The technology of cellular phones willprobably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttextwithout the key.  If the frequency path depends on they key, as Iunderstand it to, it *could* be made effectively impossible to record.Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access.  Thetelco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant.  That's the ruletoday.But even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless thejudge so ordered.  I think that even interception of the crypttextwithout a warrant would be illegal.   Cops can't record today's plaincellular calls and then ask a judge, "Hey, can we have permission tolisten to those tapes?" can they?>worse, of course, if the government then uses this "Clinton Clipper">to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption.

What's a merelicensing fee when our liberty may be at stake? (If everyone whowanted true security paid, say, $100 for a lifetime use of all ofRSA's patents--which expire in the period 1998-2002, or so--then RSAwould make tons of money and be happy, I'm sure. A small price to pay.For those to whom $100 sounds like too much, I'm sure the actual termscould be different, spread out over several years, whatever. To me,it's a small price to pay.)Strong crypto means strong privacy. Escrowing keys, sending copies ofkeys to large databases, and splitting keys into two 40-bit pieces,all done with secret and non-analyzable protocols and algorithms, is*NOT* strong crypto!Whatever some of us may think about the abstract principles ofpatenting number theory applications, this minor issue pales incomparison with the potential dangers of the Clipper proposal (notethat I said "potential"...we'll presumably learn more in the comingmonths).The RSA algorithms are at least public, have been analyzed andattacked for years, and source code is available (to better ensure nodeliberate weakenesses or trapdoors).I know of a number of groups putting together voice encryption systemsusing off-the-shelf hardware (like Soundblaster boards for the PC) andCELP-type software. The new generations of PCs, using fast 486s andPentiums are fast enough to do real-time voice encryption. Combinedwith Diffie-Hellman key exchange, this should provide an alternativeto the Clipper system.Of course, we don't really know if the Administration proposes tooutlaw competing systems. (It seems to me that their goal of tappingterrorists, child pornographers, and Hilary bashers would be thwartedif low-cost alternatives to Clipper proliferated. Not to defend childpornographers or terrorists, but limiting basic freedoms to catch afew criminals is not the American way of doing things.

They designed the system to make itdifficult for tyranny to arise. For instance, one of the reasons thefourth amendment was put there was to make it harder for thegovernment to try to make smuggling a crime. Think I jest? JohnHancock made all his money smuggling rum, which is, after all, a drug.Think about it. The government has everyones keys in escrow, and theFBI gets their pet "wiretap without leaving the office" scheme. Thereis a coup, which happens every day all around the world. Within hours,everyone in the country who might oppose the tyrants is beingmonitored more closely than ever before possible.Without the tools being in place, a tyranny cannot stand. With toolslike this in place, a tyrannical dictatorship could actually besuccessfully imposed.Why give the government tools with which to enslave you? Maybe you cantrust Bill Clinton, but are you willing to tell me that you can trustEVERY government that will ever arise in the U.S. hereafter? I am notwilling to make that leap of faith.>>-Tim May, whose sig block may get him busted in the New Regime>                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>Isn't this just a little melodramatic?I'm a political dissident.

Coups have happened incountries that have had stable democracies for over a hundred years.Governments throughout history have fallen. No government has lastedfor more than a few hundred years. Often, they are replaced bydictatorships. Do you really believe so intensely that it could neverever ever happen here that you are willing to bet your own life andthe lives of your children and other loved ones on it?If we construct the tools with which tyranny could be enforced, wemake it orders of magnitude more likely that it could happen, becauseif it happened with the tools already in place it could actuallystick. Naive fools such as our leadership believe they can protect us wherehundreds that have gone before have failed. Thriving democracies ledby men far more skillfull than Bill Clinton have fallen todictatorship. Rome had a thriving republic run by exquisitely skilledmen before they became a tyranny.I, for one, am unwilling to trust that it could never happen here.Only hubris would allow us to believe we are immune to what hashappened elsewhere.--Perry Metzgerpmetzger@shearson.com--Laissez faire, laissez passer.

A thirty bit serial number. And, we are told, the unit key U isderived deterministically from this serial number. That means thatthere are only one billion possible unit keys.   To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is   first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.   S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a   64-bit block R1:   R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .   Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and   N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:     R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]    R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .   R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The   first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The   rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2   are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow   agencies.Hmmm. We must assume that generating the unit key U from the serialnumber N rather than generating it from a randomly selected U1 and U2is an intentional way of assuring a "fail safe" for the government --U is completedly determined given S1, S2 and N. If S1 and S2 do notchange they constitute effective "master keys" (along with F), thetheft of which (or the possession of which by various authorities)completely obviates the security of the system. However, moreinterestingly, we know, for a fact that if S1 and S2 are fixed nomatter what the keyspace for U is no more than 2^30. Why not pick U1and U2 at random? Why this interesting restriction of they key spaceif it NOT to provide an additional back door?I find it disturbing that at the very best my security is dependant onapproximately 30 bytes worth of information that could be written onthe back of a napkin.Even if S1 and S2 change periodically, the rationale behind thisrestriction in the size of the keyspace seems strange if one isassuming that the goal is security -- and makes perfect sense if thegoal is an illusion of security.If S1 and S2 do not change, even if they remain secret I wonder ifthey can somehow be back-derived given enough unit key/serial numberpairs. We are assured that this cannot happen -- but no oneunderstands how Skipjack works outside of government officials and,soon, foreign intelligence services that gain the information viaespionage. Presumably we will eventually have the information as well-- reverse engineering gets more and more advanced every year -- butby the time we know it may be too late.   As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are   written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a   file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part   U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third   disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent   2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.   After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the   vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional   assurance that no information is left behind.None of this makes me feel the least bit secure. The silly notion of"destroying the laptop" appears to be yet another bizarre distraction.We all know that you can't read data from DRAM that has been turnedoff for more than a few moments. On the other hand, what we don't knowis why there is a need to generate the unit keys from S1 and S2 in thefirst place other than to weaken the system. We don't know if theagents in question would resist a million in cash a piece for theirinformation -- its probably worth hundreds of million, so you can makethe bribe arbitrarily hard to resist. And to tell you the truth, doingthis in a "vault" rather than in Joe Random Tempest-shielded Roomwith a laptop computer seems like melodrama designed to makehigh-school dropouts from Peoria impressed -- but it does very littlefor most of the rest of us.   The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the   room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,   and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to   the escrow agencies.What would this provide? Lets say the escrow agencies are the ACLU andthe NRA and their agents personally take back the disks and are alwayshonest. Who cares? The NSA must be laughing out loud, because theyhave the algorithm to regenerate U given N and likely don't need tosteal they keys as they effectively already have them.--Perry Metzgerpmetzger@shearson.com--Laissez faire, laissez passer.

(1) Many people will read andremember that ``encryption threatens the public safety and effectivelaw enforcement.'' (2) The Administration is explicitly failing toacknowledge that every American is entitled to use strong encryptionto ensure his own privacy. (3) The President, by implication, mayintend to outlaw any cryptographic devices which ensure privacy butdo not have a key-escrow system.I want to see an organization which will combat such statements.Encryption does _not_ threaten the public safety, any more than skimasks do. Every American _is_ entitled to use strong encryption whichensures his own privacy and is _not_ crippled by a key-escrow system.I guess I'm looking for a ``League for Cryptographic Freedom.''

A standard codec chip, a chip to do vocoding, a DESchip, a V32bis integrated modem module, and a small processor to doglue work, are all you need to have a secure phone. You can dump oneor more of the above if you have a fast processor. With integration,you could put all of them onto a single chip -- and in the future theycan be.Yes, cheap crypto is good -- but we don't need it from the government.You can do everything the clipper chip can do without needing it to becompromised. When the White House releases stuff saying "this is goodbecause it gives people privacy", note that we didn't need them togive us privacy, the capability is available using commercial hardwareright now.Indeed, were it not for the government doing everything possible tostop them, Qualcomm would have designed strong encryption right in tothe CDMA cellular phone system they are pioneering. Were it not forthe NSA and company, cheap encryption systems would be everywhere. Asit is, they try every trick in the book to stop it. Had it not beenfor them, I'm sure cheap secure phones would be out right now.They aren't the ones making cheap crypto available. They are the oneskeeping cheap crypto out of people's hands. When they hand you aclipper chip, what you are getting is a mess of pottage -- your prizefor having traded in your birthright.And what did we buy with our birthright? Did we get safety fromforeigners? No. They can read conference papers as well as anyone elseand are using strong cryptography. Did we get safety from professionalterrorists? I suspect that they can get cryptosystems themselves onthe open market that work just fine -- most of them can't be idiotslike the guys that bombed the trade center. Are we getting cheapercrypto for ourselves? No, because the market would have provided thaton its own had they not deliberately sabotaged it.Someone please tell me what exactly we get in our social contract inexchange for giving up our right to strong cryptography?--Perry Metzgerpmetzger@shearson.com--Laissez faire, laissez passer.

Somebody asked me what was wrong about overreacting in cases such as this.The reason is very simple:  How many people do you want to die in a riot? In a new Civil War? Everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it, and I'm worriedthat people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pensand paper.  Can people work within the system before trying to break it?  Examine yourhistory books, and find out how many armed revolutions led to Democratic(or Democratic style) governments.  I think you'll only find one in overfive thousand years of written history.That's not very good odds.  Somebody once said something like: "Armed Violence is meant only to beused in response to an armed attack.  It is not meant to be used inagression.  This is the difference between self-defence and murder."Let's try to avoid killing things, eh?

With other modes, once one block is bad,all later blocks will be bad too.There's also the framing problem.

All theycare about is wether or not what they are using is secure or not. That,after all IS the bottom line. Second, if I look at all the people I know who use any formof encryption at all, and this group spans people from the morons whostill insist that the DES is a good and secure standard, to people looking at trying to improve upon existing strategies, I can not thinkof anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leavestheir methods open to abuse.

Third, since most of the people I know are at least marginalyfamiliar with the vulnerabilities present in current software encryptionstratigies, I can't see how most of them are going to blindly trust thatsomeone will not figure out a good way to compromise the Clipper Chip.That despite any strengths or weaknesses that may exist in it. So, I can not see a high degree of confidence developing in the chip.Fourth, when it comes to criminal abuse, sure there are many stupidpeople out there. And yes, some will be open to being caught via the built in back door of the Clipper Chip. However, anyone who is going todo any serious investigation of how best to secure their data is goingto run into that problem pretty damned fast and, I would assume, startlooking around for other easily obtainible methods of encryption. If nothing else were avalible, none of this would be an issue. However,the truth is that most private encryption users that I've ever run intosimply do not give a damn about the legal status of RSA or PGP or anythingelse. If it works, they use it. This is not going to change either. I donot think for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will beslowed down by the advent of the Clipper Chip. It is all to easy to convert encrypted data into unintellgible garbage as it is, if anything,the Clipper Chip just adds another tool to the user.The bottom line here is that people will use what works, andunavoidibly, I'm sure most criminals would rather face an encryptionrelated charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penaltycharges in the case of criminals who murder as part of their conspiricy.The other thing that has struck me since the advent and wide useage of public encryption has begun is that quite simply the cat isout of the bag (Or if you have an interest in snooping, Pandora's Boxhas been opened), and this is not going to change. I've seen a blindnessto this that I've found utterly stunning, and the Clipper Chip, alongwith the way it has been presented only confirms this to me to a largerdegree.Sincerly,Tim Scanlon-- tfs@gravity.gmu.edu

If   that is true, the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything   on the screen can be picked-up from the video controller.  Can anybody verify   or refute this?Yes, that's true.  TEMPEST is nothing magic, it's just listening to anyavailable electromagnetic emissions and using all the analysis techniques  you know to separate out the interesting stuff. The nice thing about old CRTs is that they used to put out LOTS ofsignal, so they're easy to detect, and if you do your sync carefully,you can watch the output on the monitor in your deceptively-markedChevy Step-Van.  Some brands of electric typewriters were even worse.In both cases, it's especially nice because it gets you the data theuser is looking at, rather than whatever stuff the paging algorithm ispaging out to disk, etc.With newer, quieter equipment, there isn't as much signal, and it's harder toisolate the fun parts.

An obvious first-attempt might be to prepend a truly random (unpredictablefor Eve) block to the message, and then calculate a CRC which included therandom starting block and all of the message.  This could be encrypted afterthe message.  The problem is, I'm not sure it's impossible to come up witha message that will hash to the same CRC regardless of the random startingblock.  (It intuitively seems like it ought to be hard, but I'm not *that*sure....)  Clearly, a crypto-strength hash like MD5 or the SHA would bestronger, but again, I'm not sure I'm comfortable claiming that it'sunbreakable.    A scheme to use up some of the pad bits to decide how many bits of 0'sto include in the plaintext stream before going on wouldn't be too bad,either.  At the cost of increasing the speed with which you use up yourpad, this could be used to give you arbitrarily low probability that youropponent could spoof a valid-looking message, since any deciphered plaintextin a spot that should be carrying 0's will show that something funny's goingon.    If, for each message bit M_i, we used up one random bit, R_i, to decidewhether to insert a 0 into the plaintext stream, we'd get a total pad useof 2.5 times the message length.  (We'd expand the message size by abouthalf.)  Each 0 that should appear in the plaintext stream that doesn't is aguess for our would-be spoofer.  At each bit, she has to guess.  I'm tryingto see how to quantify her chances of making it all the way through thespoofed message, but it gets a little complicated, because she can get un-synched, and still happen to have a 0 in that place in the spoofed message.    Now, I can see a simple way of doing this that's got to be as secureas a one-time pad, at a cost of using 4 times the message length in pad bits.    For each message bit, M_i, use one random bit, R_i, and xor them togetherto get X_i.  Now, encrypt the three bits with the one-time pad.  The enemyhas no way of guessing what R_i is, so he/she can't guess what X_i is, either.Any change she makes in the ciphertext stream will have to involve a guessof what R_i was.  Is there any way to do this without using so many pad bits?    Spoofing the message is equivalent to correctly guessing as many randombits as there are bits in the message.  Clearly, this makes spoofing messagesjust as hard if you know the whole message text as if you know none of it.In fact, it looks to me like this makes it just as hard to generate a spoofedmessage with the ciphertext as without it, but I'm not entirely sure aboutthat.    Is there an easier way of doing this that's provably as secure as theone-time pad?    --John Kelsey

It does not go intogreat detail, and is almost certainly not exhaustive.  Obviously, manyof the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail ingeneral, and will pertain to secure mail programs other than RIPEM.It is maintained by Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  Itis posted monthly to a variety of news groups; followups pertainingspecifically to RIPEM should go to alt.security.ripem.CRYPTANALYSIS ATTACKS---------------------- Breaking RSA would allow an attacker to find out your private key,  in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign  messages with your private key.  RSA is generally believed to be resistant to all standard  cryptanalytic techniques.  Even a standard key (about 516 bits with  RIPEM) is long enough to render this impractical, barring a  huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring.- Breaking DES would allow an attacker to read any given message,  since the message itself is encrypted with DES.  It would not allow  an attacker to claim to be you.  DES has only 56 bits in its key, and thus could conceivably be  compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware, but few agencies  have such money to devote to simply read one message.  Since each  message has a different DES key, the work for each message would  remain high.KEY MANAGEMENT ATTACKS----------------------- Stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking  RSA.  To safeguard it, it is encrypted with a DES key which is derived  from a passphrase you type in.  However, if an attacker can get a copy  of your private keyfile and your passphrase (by snooping network  packets, tapping lines, or whatever) he could break the whole scheme.  The main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the  private key file across an untrusted link.  So don't do that.  Run   RIPEM on a trusted machine, preferably one sitting right in front of  you.  Ideally, your own machine in your own home (or maybe office)  which nobody else has physical access to.- Fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could   allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him  rather than to the real recipient.  If the enemy can fool your  intended recipient as well, he could re-encrypt the messages with  the other bogus public key and pass them along.  It is important to get the proper public keys of other people.  The most common mechanism for this is finger; assuming the opponent  has not compromised routers or daemons or such, finger can be   given a fair amount of trust.  The strongest method of key  authentication is to exchange keys in person; however, this is  not always practical.  Having other people "vouch for you" by  signing a statement containing your key is possible, although   RIPEM doesn't have features for doing this as automatically as  PGP.  RIPEM does generate and check MD5 fingerprints of public keys  in the key files; they may be exchanged via a separate channel for  authentication.PLAYBACK ATTACKS----------------- Even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography, an opponent could  still cause difficulties.  For example, suppose you send a message  with MIC-ONLY (a PEM mode which does not provide disclosure protection)  to Alice which says "OK, let's do that." Your opponent intercepts  it, and now resends it to Bob, who now has a message which is  authenticated as from you telling him to do that.  Of course, he may  interpret it in an entirely different context.  Or your opponent  could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later,  figuring it would be seen differently at a later time.  Or the  opponent could change the Originator-Name: to himself, register   your public key as his, and send a message hoping the recipient  will send him return mail indicating (perhaps even quoting!) the  unknown message.  To defeat playback attacks, the plaintext of each message should   include some indication of the sender and recipient, and a unique  identifier (typically the date).  A good front-end script for RIPEM  should do this automatically (IMHO).  As a recipient, you should be  sure that the Originator-Name: header and the sender indicated within  the plaintext are the same, that you really are a recipient, and that  the message is not an old one.  Some this also can and should be  automated.  The author of this FAQ has made a modest attempt at  automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated  headers; the programs are included in the standard distribution in  the utils directory.LOCAL ATTACKS-------------- Clearly, the security of RIPEM cannot be greater than the security of  the machine where the encryption is performed.  For example, under  UNIX, a super-user could manage to get at your encrypted mail,  although it would take some planning and effort to do something like  replace the RIPEM executable with a Trojan horse or to get a copy of  the plaintext, depending how it's stored.  In addition, the link between you and the machine running RIPEM is  an extension of that.  If you decrypt with RIPEM on a remote machine  which you are connected to via network (or, worse yet, modem), an  eavesdropper could see the plaintext (and probably also your  passphrase.)  RIPEM should only be executed on systems you trust, obviously.  In  the extreme case, RIPEM should only be used on your own machine,  which you have total control over and which nobody else has access  to, which has only carefully examined software known to be free of  viruses, and so on.  However, there's a very real trade-off between  convenience and security here.  A more moderately cautious user might use RIPEM on a UNIX workstation  where other people have access (even root access), but increase  security by keeping private keys and the (statically linked, of  course) executable on a floppy disk.  Some people will keep RIPEM on a multi-user system, but when dialing  in over an insecure line, they will download the message to their  own system and perform the RIPEM decryption there.  However, the  security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory; since  you presumably type your cleartext password to log in, you've just  given away the store, since the attacker can now log in as you and  install traps in your account to steal your private key next time  you use it from a less insecure line.  This will likely remain the  situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of  cleartext password authentication.  I find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully I manage my  security arrangement in my .plan next to my public key, so that  potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are  in place.  Some people use two keys, a short one which is not  carefully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated  with greater care for critical correspondence.UNTRUSTED PARTNER ATTACKS-------------------------- RIPEM's encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key  corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the  traffic.  However, once someone with that key gets the message, she  may always make whatever kind of transformations she wishes.  There   exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient, say, taking an  ENCRYPTED message and converting it to a MIC-ONLY message, signed by  you and readable by anyone, although RIPEM does not provide this  functionality.  Indeed, the latest PEM draft I have seen specifically  states that such transformations should be possible to allow  forwarding functions to work.   Including the recipients in the plaintext, as mentioned above, will  make it possible for recipients of a redistributed message to be aware  of its original nature.  Naturally, the security of the cryptography  can never be greater than the security of the people using it.

The serial number will be in a 64 bit block, with a 34 bit filler.  Doesn't   take a lot to check to see if that is correct.Depends on whether the filler is a constant (makes checking easy,but susceptible to replay), or variable (e.g. timer, counter, random),which makes replay harder and can also make it easier for theinquisitors to know if they've missed messages, or gotten them out ofsequence, or other interesting things that sort of person might care about.It is still easy to conceal super-encryption, at least until theinquisitors get ahold of the K key, which can take a while,presumably not in near-real-time.

What's entropy?* In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem?  A private-key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system E and a  decryption system D. The encryption system E is a collection of  functions E_K, indexed by ``keys'' K, mapping some set of  ``plaintexts'' P to some set of ``ciphertexts'' C. Similarly the  decryption system D is a collection of functions D_K such that  D_K(E_K(P)) = P for every plaintext P.  That is, succesful decryption  of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key  (index) as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext  into ciphertext.  Such systems, wherein the same key value is used to  encrypt and decrypt, are also known as ``symmetric'' cryptoystems.* What is an attack?  In intuitive terms a (passive) attack on a cryptosystem is any method  of starting with some information about plaintexts and their  corresponding ciphertexts under some (unknown) key, and figuring out  more information about the plaintexts. It's possible to state  mathematically what this means. Here we go.  Fix functions F, G, and H of n variables. Fix an encryption system E,  and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys.  An attack on E using G assuming F giving H with probability p is an  algorithm A with a pair f, g of inputs and one output h, such that  there is probability p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n), if we have  f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and g = G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)). Note that this  probability depends on the distribution of the vector (K,P_1,...,P_n).  The attack is trivial (or ``pointless'') if there is probability at  least p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n) if f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and  g = G(C_1,...,C_n). Here C_1,...,C_n range uniformly over the possible  ciphertexts, and have no particular relation to P_1,...,P_n. In other  words, an attack is trivial if it doesn't actually use the encryptions  E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n).  An attack is called ``one-ciphertext'' if n = 1, ``two-ciphertext'' if  n = 2, and so on.* What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically?  In basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure.  Read part 3: we keep saying ``a strong cryptosystem must have this  property, but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem  is strong!''  In contrast, the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely  formulate and, if possible, prove the statement that a cryptosystem is  strong. We say, for example, that a cryptosystem is secure against  all (passive) attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system (as  defined above) is too slow to be practical. If we can prove this  statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist  any (passive) cryptanalytic technique. If we can reduce this statement  to some well-known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that  the cryptosystem isn't easy to break.  Other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical  definition. Again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions  we're making and prove that they produce the desired results. We can  figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used  properly: it just means that the assumptions are valid.  The same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too. The cryptanalyst  can take advantage of incorrect assumptions. Often he can try to  construct a proof of security for a system, see where the proof fails,  and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis.  * Why is the one-time pad secure?  By definition, the one-time pad is a cryptosystem where the  plaintexts, ciphertexts, and keys are all strings (say byte strings)  of some length m, and E_K(P) is just the sum (let's say the exclusive  or) of K and P.  It is easy to prove mathematically that there are _no_ nontrivial  single-ciphertext attacks on the one-time pad, assuming a uniform  distribution of keys. Note that we don't have to assume a uniform  distribution of plaintexts. (Here's the proof: Let A be an attack,  i.e., an algorithm taking two inputs f, g and producing one output h,  with some probability p that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and  g = G(E_K(P)) (i.e., g = G(K + P)). Then, because the distribution of  K is uniform and independent of P, the distribution of K + P must also  be uniform and independent of P. But also the distribution of C is  uniform and independent of P. Hence there is probability exactly p  that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and g = G(C), over all P and C. Thus  a fortiori A is trivial.)  On the other hand the one-time pad is _not_ secure if a key K is used  for more than one plaintext: i.e., there are nontrivial  multiple-ciphertext attacks. So to be properly used a key K must be  thrown away after one encryption. The key is also called a ``pad'';  this explains the name ``one-time pad.''* What's a ciphertext-only attack?  In the notation above, a ciphertext-only attack is one where F is  constant. Given only some information G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)) about  n ciphertexts, the attack has to have some chance of producing some  information H(P_1,...,P_n) about the plaintexts. The attack is trivial  if it has just as good a chance of producing H(P_1,...,P_n) when given  G(C_1,...,C_n) for random C_1,...,C_n.  For example, say G(C) = C, and say H(P) is the first bit of P. We can  easily write down an attack---the ``guessing attack,'' which simply  guesses that H(P) is 1. This attack is trivial because it doesn't use  the ciphertext: it has a fifty-fifty chance of guessing correctly no  matter what. On the other hand there is an attack on RSA which  produces one bit of information about P, with 100% success, using C.  If it is fed a random C then the success rate drops to 50%. So this is  a nontrivial attack.* What's a known-plaintext attack?  The classic known-plaintext attack has F(P_1,P_2) = P_1,  G(C_1,C_2) = (C_1,C_2), and H(P_1,P_2) depending only on P_2.  In other words, given two ciphertexts C_1 and C_2 and one decryption  P_1, the known-plaintext attack should produce information about the  other decryption P_2.  Note that known-plaintext attacks are often defined in the literature  as producing information about the key, but this is pointless: the  cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him  decrypt further messages.* What's a chosen-plaintext attack?  A chosen-plaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical  series of _active_ attacks on a cryptosystem: attacks where the  cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor. These attacks don't fit into  our model of passive attacks explained above. Anyway, a  chosen-plaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and  look at the corresponding ciphertext, then repeat until he has figured  out how to decrypt any message. More absurd examples of this sort of  attack are the ``chosen-key attack'' and ``chosen-system attack.''  A much more important form of active attack is a message corruption  attack, where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a  way as to make a useful change in the plaintext.  There are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks:  for instance, automatically encrypting any plaintext P as  T,E_K(h(T+R+P),R,P), where T is a time-key (sequence number) chosen anew  for each message, R is a random number, and h is a one-way hash  function. Here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusive-or.* In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks?  Consider the following known-plaintext attack. We are given some  plaintexts P_1,...,P_{n-1} and ciphertexts C_1,...,C_{n-1}. We're  also given a ciphertext C_n. We run through every key K. When we find  K such that E_K(P_i) = C_i for every i < n, we print D_K(C_n).  If n is big enough that only one key works, this attack will succeed  on valid inputs all the time, while it will produce correct results  only once in a blue moon for random inputs. Thus this is a nontrivial  attack. Its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many  possible keys.* What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?  Say somebody is using the one-time pad---but isn't choosing keys  randomly and uniformly from all m-bit messages, as he was supposed to  for our security proof. In fact say he's known to prefer keys which  are English words. Then a cryptanalyst can run through all English  words as possible keys. This attack will often succeed, and it's much  faster than a brute-force search of the entire keyspace.  We can measure how bad a key distribution is by calculating its  entropy. This number E is the number of ``real bits of information''  of the key: a cryptanalyst will typically happen across the key within  2^E guesses. E is defined as the sum of -p_K log_2 p_K, where p_K is  the probability of key K.

CRYPTO '93  -  General Information  (August 22 - 26, 1993)............................................................................THE PROGRAM:  Crypto'93 is the thirteenth in a series of workshops on cryptology held at Santa Barbara, and is sponsored by the International Association for Cryptologic Research, in cooperation with the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy, the Computer Science Department of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and Bell-Northern Research (a subsidiary of Northern Telecom). The program for the workshop will cover all aspects of cryptology. Extended abstracts of the papers presented at the conference will be distributed to all attendees at the conference, and formal proceedings will be published at a later date.In addition to the regular program of papers selected or invited by the program committee, there will be a rump session on Tuesday evening for informal presentations. Facilities will also be provided for attendees to demonstrate hardware, software and other items of cryptographic interest. If you wish to demonstrate such items, you are urged to contact the General Chair so that your needs will be attended to. The social program will include hosted cocktail parties on Sunday and Monday. In addition, there will be a beach barbecue on Wednesday evening. The price of the barbecue is included in the room and board charge, and extra tickets may be purchased.ABOUT THE CONFERENCE FACILITIES:  The workshop will be held on the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara. The campus is located adjacent to the Santa Barbara airport and the Pacific Ocean. Accommodations are available in the university dormitories at relatively low cost for conference participants. Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to stay in the dormitories, so those bringing small children will need to make separate arrangements in one of several nearby hotels. More information on hotels is enclosed. Parking on campus is available at no cost to the participants. However, participants must indicate on the registration form if they desire a parking permit.TRAVEL INFORMATION:  The campus is located approximately 2 miles from the Santa Barbara airport, which is served by several airlines, including American, America West, Delta, United, and US Air. Free shuttle bus service will be provided between the Santa Barbara airport and the campus on Sunday and Thursday afternoons. All major rental car agencies are also represented in Santa Barbara, and AMTRAK has rail connections to San Francisco from the north and Los Angeles from the south. Santa Barbara is approximately 100 miles north of Los Angeles airport, and 350 miles south of San Francisco.REGISTRATION:  Participation is invited by interested parties, but attendance at the workshop is limited, and pre-registration is strongly advised. Late registrations, subject to a late registration fee, may be accepted if space is available, but there are NO GUARANTEES. To register, fill out the attached registration form and return to the address on the form along with payment in full before July 9, 1993.

Read it again yourself, then re-apply the admonition you gave to theprevious poster to yourself, as well.  The first clause is not a condition,it is a reason for explicitly supporting the right WHICH EXISTS, MILITIAOR NOT, that the people have a right to keep and bear arms.  This isNOT a right granted by the Constitution, it is a right presumed to existby default.  The Constitution mentioning a right is to prevent thegovernment from removing that right by stating very clearly the governmentshall NOT infringe (mess with, block, limit) that right.  Remember theConstitution is a bunch of negative things - things the government CANNOTdo.  All rights, etc not epxressly given to the government go to thestates and the PEOPLE (the same people the other 9 Amendments in theBill of Rights talk about).Since I am sure you will summarily reject my interpretation, I amappending a linguistic analysis by one far more expert than myself (andyou, I suspect).

There aresome things in there that Big Brother types, like Biden, etc must havereally had to swallow hard to admit.I think you will find that people that seriously study the Constitutionand state what it means will say the same thing.  Those who come upwith 'new improved meanings' are those who are trying to subvert theConstitution for a given agenda.  Like Clinton and his Clinton Cripple,Gun Control, People Control, and Control Control, and the whole nastymess.Please tell us how this person is in error, won't you? (And please back itup with some proof, since I am backing my assertion up with independentproof, and have a BUNCH MORE I can provide...).NOTE:  Followups set to talk.politics.guns--------- Begin included article -------THE UNABRIDGED SECOND AMENDMENT      by J. Neil SchulmanIf you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you'd ring up Carl Sagan,right ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to callwould be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you callif you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaningof the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?That was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the LosAngeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at HoughtonMifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as theforemost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr.Brocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professorjournalism at the University of Southern California and the author of"American Usage and Style: The Consensus."A little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud'sexpertise.Roy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decadesbefore embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism atUSC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with theprofessional aspects of journalism for "Editor and Publisher", a weeklymagazine focusing on the journalism field.He's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and MerriamWebster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud'sfifth book on usage, "American Usage and Style: The Consensus," has been incontinuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winnerof the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award.That sounds like an expert to me.After a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introducedmyself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sentthe following letter:"I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert inEnglish usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the UnitedStates Constitution, and extract the intent from the text."The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, beingnecessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keepand bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'"The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of thesentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of afree State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respectto the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'theright of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'"I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take intoconsideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restrictedentirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further,since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigationregarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whateveranalysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing tostand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify underoath to support, if necessary."My letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment,then concluded:"I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and taskwith this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it isvitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment.While I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance ofits results, I ask that you do this because of that importance."After several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms forhis doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of ouropinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other politicalsubject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I haveinserted my questions for the sake of clarity):[Copperud:] "The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to thesecurity of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in yourletter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than aclause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which isfollowed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential formaintaining a militia."In reply to your numbered questions:[Schulman:] "(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keepand bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?"[Copperud:] "(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and beararms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or byothers than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respectto a right of the people."[Schulman:] "(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' grantedby the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume apreexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely statethat such right 'shall not be infringed'?"[Copperud:] "(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existenceis assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall bepreserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia."[Schulman:] "(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear armsconditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in factnecessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is notexisting, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,shall not be infringed' null and void?"[Copperud:] "(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right tokeep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existenceof a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of theright to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulatedmilitia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keepand bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence."[Schulman:] "(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessaryto the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to placeconditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is suchright deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?"[Copperud:] "(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, aspreviously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of themilitia."[Schulman:] "(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulatedmilitia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,''well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?"[Copperud:] "(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superiorauthority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civiliancontrol over the military."[Schulman:] "(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account thechanged meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200years ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of theintents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated."[Copperud:] "To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in themeaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of theamendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: "Since awell-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, theright of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'[Schulman:] "As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would alsoappreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the SecondAmendment to the following sentence,"A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a freeState, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not beinfringed.'"My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,"(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the waythe words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?;and"(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the peopleto keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- forexample, registered voters with a high-school diploma?"[Copperud:] "(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels theamendment in grammatical structure."(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies thepossibility of a restricted interpretation."Professor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in hiscover letter: "With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculativeefforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reachany conclusion."So now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage whatmany knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionallyprotects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding allgovernments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.As I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in theSoviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in thatpart of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than theold guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.And here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointedofficials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United Statesignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely.American citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owningarms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirementsregarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is anabridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms,guaranteed by the Constitution.And even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of therest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms topreserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg ourelected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regardingthem as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges whodecide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means butmeans whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?Or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitutionof the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defendthat promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?(C) 1991 by The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation.Informational reproduction of the entire article is hereby authorizedprovided the author, The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation arecredited.

No agency such as the NSA (or whoever) would approve the public release of a crypto-system, if they didn't already have the technicalmeans or the know-how to decrypt everything at their whim. Surely the wholepoint of all this madness is to make Joe Public think that his/hercommunications will be kept safe, while James Bond at the NSA can, if needbe, have full, decrypted access to someone's communications? That'll bequite a heist, if they can pull it off.

The system for the   escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to   encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization.But DES is strong enough that only the government can break it now,so the major effect is to make it EASIER for government to break!*At best* it makes it more difficult for the NSA to break, since theyneed to get one of the two escrowed keys to do a brute-force searchfor the other 40-bit key.Similarly, it didn't say "We're making encryption is commercially available."because encryption *is* already commercially available, includingforms the NSA may not be able to break, like triple-DES or IDEA.And phone companies could offer DES-based systems *now* if they wereconvinced the government would let them and they could make enough money.The next thing it didn't say is "We're making encryption legal",because of course encryption *has always been* legal, and thePresident can't change the First Amendment merely by decree.What it *did* say was:In making this decision, I do not intend to prevent theprivate sector from developing, or the government from approving,other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective inassuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system.which clearly means "We're making encryption illegal unless we get your keys.Soon.  Once business buys into this."Another thing it didn't say is "We're going to ask Congress for moneyto do *lots* more wiretapping", because of course, there's a budget crisis,and Congress might debate the policy issues or not give them the cash.What it *did* say was:   The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to   the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct   lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure   law enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General   shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture   Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase.which means "We've got money Congress can't control and we're going tobuy lots of wiretapping equipment with it to detect NON-APPROVED CRYPTO(that's what "preserve the government's ability to conduct ... surveillance" means.)  --#Pray for peace;      Bill# Bill Stewart 1-908-949-0705 wcs@anchor.att.com AT&T Bell Labs 4M312 Holmdel NJ#              No, I'm *from* New Jersey, I only *work* in cyberspace....# White House Commect Line 1-202-456-1111  fax 1-202-456-2461

The system does not rely on registering> people as owning particular phone units.> > I am against the proposal, but lets be accurate in our objections.> Do not presume to tell me what I have and have not read.  The system maynot rely upon registering people as owning particular phone units, butit is necessary to know which phone units are likely to be used for somesuspected criminal communication before you can obtain their unit keysfrom escrow.  This necessity raises the stakes in favor of a criminal'scoercing or colluding use of some other person's Clipper phone.I will restate my assumptions more explicitly and amplify my argument.The original title perhaps should have been "Distinction between legaland illegal cipher systems considered harmful", but "Clipper consideredharmful" is not inaccurate, and is more eye-catching in the current context.Assumptions:  1.  Clipper is made available.  2.  Laws are passed to make use of cipher systems other than Clipper illegal      (either on radio systems, or on any common carrier system).  These laws      also include enforcement authority to listen across the relevant radio      spectrum (or other medium), characterize signals, validate Clipper      wrappers, detect probable use of non-Clipper ciphers, and make such      detection a cause for further action.  3.  For escrowed keys to be useful, some specific Clipper chip must be      associated with a suspected criminal.  This means that at a minimum      some association between the common carrier's unique phone ID (ESN) and      the Clipper chip serial number N will be stored in a government database.      An observed pairing of N and ESN other than the one recorded raises a      red flag.  4.  To reduce ordinary fraud, the cellphone system which offers Clipper      will also be constructed with an ESN mechanism much more tamper-proof      and much less spoofable than today's cellphones.  5.  Criminals want inscrutable communications.  Some criminals are not      entirely stupid or ignorant, and will figure out both that Clipper      cellphones offer excellent security in normal circumstances, and that      they offer no security against law enforcement once a (presumably      legitimate) wiretap order exists.  They will also figure out that the      wiretap order must necessarily be against a specific cellphone, because      each one has a unique unit key.  6.  Criminals do not want to call attention to themselves.  Because they      are not stupid or ignorant (or because they read netnews), and because      they know that their open use of a non-Clipper cipher is likely to be      detected, they will generally avoid using non-Clipper ciphers directly      on some monitorable/tappable channel.  They know that do so would raise      a red flag, putting a given cellphone (if not a given person) under      immediate suspicion.  7.  It is impractical to reverse engineer Skipjack, discover family key F,      and construct a functional clone of a Clipper chip.By #2, #3, #4, and #7 it will be very difficult to spoof a given Clipperphone without immediate detection.  Because it is difficult to obscure one'sassociation to a specific phone by reprogramming or changing chipsaround, the criminal will be motivated to find an intact phone which isassociated with someone else.A non-stupid criminal will conclude that they can have Clipper-securecommunications, at least for some limited time T, if they buy, beg, borrow,or steal use of someone's phone in a way that prevents that person fromreporting compromise of the phone for at least time T.  The encryptedcommunications might have been recorded, and thus be retrievable later,but the criminal can delay, and quite likely evade, discovery by destroyingor abandoning the phone before T elapses.It would be unusual for an innocent person to volunteer use of their Clipperphone to someone else.  The honest subscriber doesn't want to pay someoneelse's bill, and he doesn't want to fall under suspicion.This leaves two sources of Clipper phones for criminal use: coercionand collusion.Coercion first.  Theft bears a relatively low risk, but also sometimesa low time until detection (a few minutes if a phone is stolen froma car parked in front of a store, a couple of weeks if a phone is stolenfrom someone who is away on vacation).  Criminal commerce is likely toarise in stolen Clipper phones, with phones coming from risk-inured poorcriminals, and cash coming from risk-averse wealthy criminals.  Someonewho is extraordinarily motivated to gain a day or two of undetectedcommunication (like a terrorist) could kill a person or hold them hostage.The limited time (before detection) that a coerced phone is useful meansthat continuing criminal enterprises require a continuing supply offreshly coerced phones.There would also be created a collusive commerce between relativelywealthy criminals, and ignorant or don't-care patsies who need money,and who will submit to being paid in return for subscribing to Clipperphone service for someone else's use.Criminals will learn that it is more to their advantage to coerce use of aClipper cellphone than it is to apply a non-Clipper cipher to a normalcellphone.  They will call much less attention to themselves (or at least totheir stolen phone) this way.  The fact of a phone's use being coerced mustfirst be reported before it can be identified as an interesting phone, andhave its keys obtained from escrow.Clipper also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal toconceal use of super-encryption.  An automated full-system surveillancemechanism (quite feasible across radio bandwidth) which knows family key F,can validate Clipper wrappers and N:ESN associations, but it cannot revealin realtime the use of super-encryption, unless it knows all unit keys,which we are being assured are only to be made available in two separatepieces, upon specific wiretap-like order.Whereas a criminal's use of any cipher within a normally cleartext mediumwould stand out, a criminal's use of a non-Clipper cipher within a Clippermedium would be very difficult to detect, even ex post facto in bulkrecordings, as long as the association between criminal and specific Clipperchip is fractured.If you make use of this other cipher illegal per se, then you can chargethe criminal with this (if you can identify the true criminal - he'll beusing someone else's phone), but you'll have no evidence to help you againstwhatever traditional crime he might have been planning.  You will not even beable to detect that unusual (encrypted) communications are occurring until youidentify specific phones and obtain their keys from escrow.The gangster and terrorist are thus arguably more, not less, secure thanthey were before Clipper came along.I therefore consider Clipper harmful because:  1.  It does not provide absolute privacy to the honest public against      aggressive or dishonest government.  2.  If other ciphers are proscribed, it engenders new types of direct      criminal threat to the honest public.  3.  It provides an extraordinarily effective mechanism for criminals to      hide their use of some other cipher, making it more difficult than      ever even to gain notice that unusual communications are occurring      and that plans for some criminal act might be in progress.  4.  If other ciphers are proscribed, lazy investigators and prosecutors      are more likely to pursue the easily quantifiable cipher-use crime      than they are the traditional and directly harmful crimes which key      escrow is claimed to help against.  5.  If other ciphers are proscribed, the stage is set for witch hunting      of "illegal" cipher use.  Because any computer can be used as a cipher      machine...Brad Yearwood    brad@optilink.com     {uunet, pyramid}!optilink!bradPetaluma, CA

Also, my math is frequently noted forbeing wrong, so you'll better check the calculations yourself.I assume that 14.4K means 14.4K Bits.  So if we assume one start andone stopbit, and no protocol overhead, the effective number of bytesper second is 1.44K.Let's also assume that you do not want to transmit your speech instereo, so that you can send 1,440 samples/sec.  This corresponds to aNyquist frequency of 720 Hz, which should be too low, especially ifyou think about the 8-bit low quality sound.  Furthermore, your D/Aconverter will probably not present you with a signal that has beencut off at 720 Hz, but will instead alias in all the higherfrequencies.  (Although you can definitely build a filter to overcomethat problem.)On the other hand, speech should be easily compressible.  For example,you could form power spectra, or you could simply band-pass filter andthen linearize the fourier transforms.  It won't be CD quality sound,but it'll be discernible.  The power spectrum method is very good inthat respect.  I have once programmed such a software compressor, andcompression rates of 90% with relative errors due to linearization ofless than 5% were common.  Although I must say that these were musicalsounds, not speech.Have fun.-- Stephan <neuhaus@informatik.uni-kl.de>sig closed for inventory.

Better yet, instead of thrashing around on the DOS file system, takeit a step further.  Write yourself a minimal "file system" program thatis used to create/delete files, en/decrypt them to ramdisk, list adirectory. Put the util, password protected, on a floppy.   The catch is that the storage space used by this util is NOT partof the DOS file system.  Instead, defrag your disk, thus packing allallocated clusters into clusters 0-n.  Then use the back end of thepartition to hold your 'stealth' file system.  Or, leave a small 2ndpartition on the disk that is not assigned to DOS.  Another approachmight be to use a directory that contains a set of invariant files (DOSsystem files, for instance).  Due to DOS allocating a minimum storage unit of a "cluster" there is unused physical space on the disk betweenthe tail end of each file and the end of its associated cluster. Thesedead spaces could be concatenated and used to hold your stealth filesystem.   Now you have a situation where no encrypted data "appears" on yourdisk at all :-). -- Ray Berry kb7ht ray@ole.cdac.com  rjberry@eskimo.com  73407.3152@compuserve.com

Just the Skipjackcryptographic algorithm? Or does it also implement a "chip to chip"communications protocol? If it does implement a communicationsprotocol, can it be used as just a "crypt chip" also.  2) Where can the chip specifications and spec sheets be obtained?  3) Who may purchase them and under what conditions?  4) Are there restrictions as to how the chip may be used in a system?  5) The security of the algorithm and the encrypted communications doesnot appear to require that the "Family key" be a secret. Why isit a secret? What happens when the "family key" becomes well known?If it's a secret to make traffic analysis more difficult, doesthe "Law enforcement message" contain any random information?How much and how random is it?  6) Can the chip be programmed to reveal the "Unit key"? The chip "serialnumber"? Any of the programming parameters?-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Raymond S.

You are correct, it is illegal to send cryptographiccode (and lots of other things) out of the country without a license.HOWEVER, every US citizen has a general export license, allowingexport of lots of things, including constitutionally protected speech.This has the effect that it is legal for US citizens to export somethings which it is illegal for a US corporation to export withoutfirst obtaining a license.   > Dunno if you'd get one for the particular code you have; the only   > way to find out is to apply for a license.

As a commercial IP software vendor, it really is my professional opinion that the NREN, at this point, is irrelevant to private sector networking.  If it had been deployed five years ago, it would have been a major development.  Now,however, it's just an upgrade to the NSFnet, and an attempt to revive the lagging use of the national supercomputer centers.  You could cut out the NSFnet completely, and the Internet would continue chugging along without a hiccup (aside from a few universities).Long-haul networking and Internet connectivity have long since ceased to be under federal sponsorship or regulation, at least in the USA.  The success of the CIX (Commercial Internet Exchange) is a prime example of this.  While our dear VP has been promoting his "data superhighway," the private sector has been building it, without the NSFnet's restrictions.To illustrate, a connection from the machine on my desk to the machine your article was posted from (pizzabox.demon.co.uk) involves *only* commercial IP providers until it hits Amsterdam.  No NSFnet.  No NREN.  No "appropriate use" restrictions.  It's even 1.544mbps (T1) until it hits the EUnet gateway...QED.Amanda WalkerInterCon Systems Corporation

Just as we have seen in the past with"blue box" technology, and in the present with modified cellular phones,we can expect to see among high-stakes criminals a lucrative market forstolen cipher phones which can be used for a few days.  The high-stakescriminals will pay the life-is-cheap types substantial amounts for stoleninstruments.Because a person is typically discovered as missing or dead in a few days,a stolen instrument will be usable for only a few days.  There will be acontinuing demand for fresh phones: fresh bodies.In other words, Clipper and similar systems have the potential to turn acurrent inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct, vicious, andpersistent threat to the general public.On the other hand, if a criminal were to apply some arbitrary cipher to adevice in a mostly non-ciphered network, the communication will at leaststand out as being unusual, and perhaps worthy of other means of investigation.Finally, because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting inrealtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments,there will exist strong motivation to record and archive _all_ communicationsin the network for ex-post-facto scrutiny (once some criminal act is discovered,and the instruments involved have been identified).  While recording andarchiving may not be feasible for wireline networks, it is probably feasibleacross the more limited bandwidth of radio networks.  The existence of theserecordings could open up vast potential for abuse.Brad Yearwood    brad@optilink.com     {uunet, pyramid}!optilink!bradPetaluma, CA

They are posted with his permission.  Theimplications of some details are fascinating.-------Date: Sat, 17 Apr 93 23:05:23 PDTFrom: "Martin Hellman" <hellman@isl.stanford.edu>To: (a long list of recipients)Subject: Clipper ChipMost of you have seen the announcement in Friday's NY Times,etc. about NIST (National Institute of Standards & Technology)announcing the "Clipper Chip" crypto device. Several messgeson the net have asked for more technical details, and some havebeen laboring under understandable misunderstandings giventhe lack of details in the news  articles. So here to help outis your friendly NSA link: me. I was somewhat surprised Fridayto get a call from the Agency which supplied many of the missingdetails. I was told the info was public, so here it is (the cc of thisto Dennis Branstad at NIST is mostly as a double check on myfacts since I assume he is aware of all this; please let me knowif I have anything wrong):The Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in Silicon. Each chip will have two secret, 80-bit keys. One will be the same for all chips (ie a system-wide key) and the other will be unit specific. I don't know what NIST and NSA will call them, but I will call them the system key SK and unit key UK in this message. The IC will be designed to be extremely difficult to reverse so that the system key can be kept secret. (Aside: It is clear that they also want to keep the algorithm secret and, in my opinion, it may be as much for that as this stated purpose.) The unit key will be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 and K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow authorities. Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be decided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that they will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased. When a law enforcement agency gets a court order, they will present it to these two escrow authorities and receive K1 and K2, thereby allowing access to the unit key UK.In addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his or her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key plain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be encrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK, and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK producing     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}When a court order obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law enforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information flowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that they may do this constantly on all links, with or without a court order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links over which a message will flow.] This gives the agency access to      E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial numberin the above message. They then check the serial number of the unit and see if it is on the "watch list" for which they have a court order. If so, they will decrypt E[K; UK] to obtain K, and then decrypt E[M; K] to obtain M.I am still in the process of assessing this scheme, so please do not take the above as any kind of endorsement of the proposed scheme. All I am trying to do is help all of us assess the scheme more knowledgably. But I will say that the need for just one court order worries me. I would feel more comfortable (though not necessarily comfortable!) if two separate court orders were needed, one per escrow authority. While no explanation isneeded, the following story adds some color: In researchingsome ideas that Silvio Micali and I have been kicking around,I spoke with Gerald Gunther, the constitutional law experthere at Stanford and he related the following story: WhenEdward Levi became Pres. Ford's attorney general (rightafter Watergate), he was visited by an FBI agent askingfor "the wiretap authorizations." When Levy asked forthe details so he could review the cases as required bylaw, the agent told him that his predecessors just turnedover 40-50 blank, signed forms every time. Levi did notcomply and changed the system, but the lesson is clear: No single person or authority should have the power toauthorize wiretaps (or worse yet, divulging of personalkeys). Sometimes he or she will be an Edward Leviand sometimes a John Mitchell.Martin Hellman----Date: Sun, 18 Apr 93 11:41:42 PDTFrom: "Martin Hellman" <hellman@isl.stanford.edu>To: smb@research.att.comSubject: Re: Clipper ChipIt is fine to post my previous message to sci.crypt if you also post this message with it in which:1. I ask recipients to be sparse in their requesting further info from me or asking for comments on specific questions. Bythis posting I apologize for any messages I am unable torespond to. (I already spend too much time answering too muche-mail and am particularly overloaded this week with otherresponsibilities.) 2. I note a probably correction sent to me by Dorothy Denning.She met with the person from NSA thatI talked with by phone, so her understanding is likely tobetter than mine on this point: Where I said the transmittedinfo is  E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}she says the message is not double encrypted. The systemkey (or family key as she was told it is called) only encryptsthe serial number or the serial number and the encryptedunit key. This is not a major difference, but I thought itshould be mentioned and thank her for bringing it tomy attention. It makes more sense since it cuts downon encryption computation overhead.

The parts aremostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers every 21 days.Contents:* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?* What are the US export regulations?* What is TEMPEST?* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?* Is RSA patented?* What about the Voynich manuscript?* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?  The NSA is the official security body of the U.S. government. It  was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40's, and  has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is  known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,  and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the  world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of  cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many  years ahead of the public state of the art, and can undoubtedly break  many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national  security almost all information about the NSA is classified.  Bamford's book [BAMFD] gives a history of the people and operations of  the NSA. The following quote from Massey [MAS88] highlights the  difference between public and private research in cryptography:  ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,  one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted  behind closed doors. Without doubt, the number of workers engaged  today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of  those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10  years has there in fact been widespread open research in  cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflicts  between these two research communities. Open research is common  quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open  exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in  scholarly journals. But can a government agency, charged with  responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,  countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can  a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might  undermine the effectiveness of his own government's code-breakers?  One might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would  force all governments to behave like Stimson's `gentlemen', but one  must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with  political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most  scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have  occurred between government agencies and open researchers in  cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which  we are aware) have been so few and so mild.''* What are the US export regulations?  In a nutshell, there are two government agencies which control  export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export  Administration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce, authorized by  the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Another is the Office  of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) in the State Department, authorized  by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As a rule  of thumb, BXA (which works with COCOM) has less stringent  requirements, but DTC (which takes orders from NSA) wants to see  everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA.  The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting  discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what  people think about those laws, and many other complex issues which  go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to  consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in  jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at  least heard of the ITAR.* What is TEMPEST?  TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer  equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that  information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a CRT) at  quite a distance and with little effort.  Needless to say, encryption doesn't do much good if the cleartext  is available this way.* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?  (Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for  corrections.)  The story in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward (1885) goes: Thomas  Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass  of treasure and buried it in Bedford County, Virginia, leaving  three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the  location, contents, and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.  Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called B2;  it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the  Declaration of Independence (DOI) as key. B1 and B3 are unsolved;  many documents have been tried as the key to B1.  Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B1 by various  means with an eye toward splitting the treasure:  The Beale Cypher Association  P.O. Box 975  Beaver Falls, PA 15010  You can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles FAQL by including the  line:  send index  in a message to netlib@peregrine.com and following the directions.  (There are apparently several different versions of the cipher  floating around. The correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet,  says John King <kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com>.)  Some believe the story is a hoax. Kruh [KRU88] gives a long list of  problems with the story. Gillogly [GIL80] decrypted B1 with the DOI  and found some unexpected strings, including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP.  Hammer (president of the Beale Cypher Association) agrees that this  string couldn't appear by chance, but feels there must be an  explanation; Gwyn (sci.crypt expert) is unimpressed with this  string.* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?  The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography, with an emphasis  on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with  pencil-and-paper or computers. Its organ ``The Cryptogram'' includes  articles and challenge ciphers. Among the more than 50 cipher types in  English and other languages are simple substitution, Playfair,  Vigenere, bifid, Bazeries, grille, homophonic, and cryptarithm.  Dues are $15 for one year (6 issues); more outside of North America;  less for students under 18 and seniors. Subscriptions should be sent  to ACA Treasurer, 18789 West Hickory St., Mundelein, IL 60060.* Is RSA patented?  Yes. The patent number is 4,405,829, filed 12/14/77, granted 9/20/83.  For further discussion of this patent, whether it should have been  granted, algorithm patents in general, and related legal and moral  issues, see comp.patents and misc.legal.computing. For information  about the League for Programming Freedom see [FTPPF]. Note that one of  the original purposes of comp.patents was to collect questions such as  ``should RSA be patented?'', which often flooded sci.crypt and other  technical newsgroups, into a more appropriate forum.* What about the Voynich manuscript?  nelson@reed.edu (Nelson Minar) says there is a mailing list on the  subject.  the address to write to subscribe to the VMS mailing list  is: <voynich-request@rand.org>  the ftp archive is: rand.org:/pub/voynich  There's all sorts of information about the manuscript itself, of  course. A good bibliography can be found on the ftp site. Kahn's  "The Codebreakers" gives a good introduction.

Otherwise, the key management problems inherent to symetric ciphers would make the system unworkable. It probably has some sort of public key exchange that takes placeat the start of each call. Thats how they would identify the private key in their data base?This means that either the NSA has developed some non RSA public key algorythm or the feds have decided to subsidize PKP & RSADSI. The former is rather an exciting posibility since keeping the algorythm secret while makingchip implimentations widely avalibe will be exceptionally hard. If the fedsare forced to make it avalible in order to gain public acceptance than that could break RSA's stranglehold on public key crypto in the U.S.   As for my impressions of the whole scheme It seems that instead of trying toban strong crypto, they are trying to co-opt it. Their contention that they need to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the keyregistration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm. More likelyis that they dont want anyone constructing black market devices which dont have the keys registered. Anyone else notice that in their Q&A session, theytalk about releasing the keys only to people with proper autiorization butcarefully dance around stating that the keys will simply have to be supeonaed.They seem to be trying to keep open the posibility of obtaining keys without court order even though tapping a phone line requires one. Also pick up on their implicit threat of eithe accept this or we'll ban strong crypto outright?I dont trust this plan at all and plan to oppose it in all (legal) wayspossible.Bill Smythe

So why is Cylink the only (and expensive) game in town?Note: I think Cylink is great, and if my boss would double my salary, I'd buy a bunch of their stuff :).One thing that Clipper offers is interoperability, at a higher degree of security than we currently have in non-proprietary voice encryption systems.This means it will be cheaper than anyone's proprietary scheme, and easier to deploy.  This is, of course, either a bug or a feature depending on how you look at it :).> Indeed, even without special engineering, you can construct a good > system right now.

ShearerI do not think they can use the eavesdropping as evidence at all. However,using the info they gather while listening, they can go searching THE rightplace and find good, strong evidence, which they can use in court. Question : currently, it is easy to wire-tap, from the technical point ofview, at least. Anybody using the appropriate radio receiver can listento communications between a car-telephone and the ground station. The policealso, obviously. The clipper chip will make it much more difficult for thenon-authorized person to eavesdrop (note that I DO NOT write << impossible>> ).The privacy will thus improve from the current situation. Poeple who REALLYhave something to hide already DO NOT use the phone to speak of these things.If an illegal operation is really worth, one can afford having critical datacarried by a person rather than sending it electronically. The clipper chip will not change this. The problem is more politic. Foreign countries will never accept the clipperchip is the access to the escrow cannot be directly granted to their ownpolice following their OWN law, not the US law. i.e. each country will haveits own escrow. How then will it be possible to monitor the internationaltraffic? or, will encrypted international traffic be possible ? or will therebe an international escrow, some kind of U.N. thing ?Forbidding crypted communication is impractical: how is it possible to spota crypted communication in the thousands of megabytes of data which circulateon the various existing networks. What about private networks ? And this willbe more and more impossible as the volume of electronic traffic will increrasein the next years.I think that the clipper chip can only be an interesting device to limit therisk of , for instance, one's girlfriend's husband listening to his wife'scommunications. It will bring no more as regards to security. Is it worth ?I think so if its cost is limited, I think that many privacy invasions are donenot only by official services, but also by private entities. The clipper canhelp reducing these. Provided we do not hope too much of it, it is not a realdanger and it can be helpful.Ph. HOOGVORST

First, let meflame the famous Dave S. : He's obviously only 10 years old.  Cut himsome slack. :^}The joke about Clinton/crypto/drugs slammed me thru the roof.  Nice jobguys!  I've been working on marijuana legalization for over 5 yearsnow, Clinton's actions so far have really helped.  But because ofgovernment action taken against various other groups, I have developeda 64 bit DES based on public literature to protect my mailing list.The S-boxes are the critical component, and since I chose 32 out of 57based on the key, cracking this DES is going to tough.  (The reason itslows you down a touch is that for each key you try you need to use adifferent set of s-boxes, I know it's only a vector, but it sure makesrandom search a pain).  Several marijuana legalization groups have hadtheir mailing lists confiscated when people were charged with druguse/sales.  It's not a crime to be a member of a legalization org,*but* you will be watched.It really is important to write a letter to every official youpersonally vote for to explain *why* your privacy is being destroyed bythe "cripple chip".  Amazingly enough they do listen when they get*enough* mail.  The Doonsbery jokes about NRA postcards are real, andthe IMI (Illinois Marijuana Initiative) has grown to the point where we*are* seeing some changes.It's pretty clear that all the hullabaloo is really about theimplimentation decision being made behind our backs.  As Vesselinpoints out, this was common practice in communist regimes (and may beagain depending on how the vote goes).  But just as criminals have gunsand "law abiding" citizens don't, and criminals like me have marijuanaand "law abiding" subjects don't, criminals like me will have securecrypto while "law abiding" robots don't.  PGP is nice, but as time goeson we all can do better.  And to save our hides we will.Someone posted an excerpt from Machiavelli.  He's my favorite dude.500 years ago he saw clearly how people *are*, and tried to explainthat to "princes" who wanted people to *obey*.  One section not quoted(I've got "The Prince" at home, so I'll just paraphrase :) ) had to dowith conquring a free city.  The only way is to *completly destroy*it.  Failing that, you must appoint locals to high positions and acceptthe people's customs.  Even after 100 years of oppression, a peoplewill remember their heratige and rise up to overthrow the oppresivegovernment.  And he gave an example.  And that was 300 years *before*Thomas Jefferson.There were questions about watching traffic.  Only *interesting* trafficis watched: stuff that goes overseas and comes back; stuff with keywordslike marijauana, cryptography, NSA;  certain individuals who are knownsubversives, etc.  It is easy enough to store all that traffic.  So ifyou know how to be *subversive* i.e. how to be unseen, it's pretty easyto go unnoticed for a long time.  The stronger your crypto system and theless you're noticed, the better your chances of developing an organizationwhich can diseminate truth to the masses.Which gets me to the thread about a "public encrypted conference".That's just silly.  The first thing the feds do is send in aninfiltrator (like Dave S.) and they know what you're doing.  It will befun for teenagers and college students, but for the real world it'spretty pointless.  Crypto is useful for more things than hiding whereyou get your marijuana.Guns, drugs and crypto do have some commonality: there are people ingovernment who want you to *obey* their rules.  As Lundquist says inalt.drugs "Live free or don't".  Machiavelli pointed out that's justhow most people actually live, inspite of appearences to the contrary.It's true that the decision to shove the clipper (not the same thing asIntergraph's!!!) down our throats violates the principles of what theU.S. was founded on, but the government is full of idiotic robotscalled bureaucrats and there's less to worry about than one mightthink.  Only really innocent (read naive) subjects of the U.S. will behurt by this, the rest of us *criminals* will live in secure freedom.de Toqueville pointed out 150+ years ago that the tyranny of themajority will be mitigated by the mediocrity of the government.And given what I see government officials doing where I work (ArgonneNational Lab.) the level of stupidity makes Dave S. look smart.Patience, persistence, truth,work: dvader@hemp-imi.hep.anl.govDr. mikehome: mrosing@igc.org-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: 2.2iQBVAgUBK9hETK3mm/E84rLHAQFV+gH9ExvzfXbNR4x0BTg2nQIxB5/ZMaxT289BG4QjTsv8mszMrzU1DcJ8eLIQ37BwX53jATBH9U4B/biqmGKiPzHCmA===S3hf-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----

Otherwise you are on your own.> David,  As an economist, I'm sure you can see the flaws in this logic. If the (naive)market is flooded with proprietary, but weak, encryption, then truly strong encryption will be unable to compete. Suppose the govt had a secret TV broadcaststandard, and then sold TVs below cost. Private industry has a better standard,but it's not as widespread due to the govt early flooding of the marketwith cheap proprietary sets. Even though the industry's technology is better,the programming is being broadcast to the govt's unduplicatable standard.Who could compete?  The other flaw, of course, is that making something voluntary today ensuresthat it will be voluntary in the future. I went to renew my CA drivers licenselast week and was required not only to give my SSN, but to PRODUCE AN SSNCARD to veryify the number!  Note that a federal law once said that no stateor local govt could ever require the use of SSNs for drivers license registration(specifically!).   I do not trust the govt that says "trust me on this even though we couldhave an arrangement that doesn't require your trust."  Something is bigtime fishy. If you look more carefully, you'll see it.  -mel________________________________________________________________________| Mel beckman                  |   Internet: mbeckman@mbeckman.com     || Beckman Software Engineering | Compuserve: 75226,2257                || Ventura, CA 93003            |  Voice/fax: 805/647-1641 805/647-3125 ||______________________________|_______________________________________| "You can observe a lot just by watching."  -Yogi Bera

I am the administratorof csrc.ncsl.nist.gov, alias first.org.  It's a system set up to help outthe needs of FIRST, a Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams, which includes a number of world-wide incident response teams such as CERT/CC andother places in Europe.  As to the VRFY and EXPN commands, they are normallydisabled, since early on we didn't want crackers to find out the names ofincident response folks on our mailing lists.  We had a disk crash severalmonths ago which required completely rebuilding the O/S files - same oldstory, our backups weren't especially helpful.  As you can guess, I didn'tremember to re-disable VRFY and EXPN until I saw people on the net trying tofind out who was behind clipper@csrc...  When I saw people's names postedhere, I felt it was time to clear things up.  So, EXPN and VRFY on csrc havealways been disabled in the past for reasons having nothing to do with Clipper.I posted the White House announcements at the request of policy folks herebecause csrc also provides Usenet service.  I posted them from an accountcalled 'clipper.'  I also created an alias called 'clipper' that containsthe addresses of members of the NIST Computer Security Privacy and AdvisoryBoard, set up under law of the Computer Security Act of 1987, and addressesof other individuals not affiliated with NIST but involved in cryptography,security, and privacy - I believe that these individuals were included onthis list because NIST felt it important to get them the Clipper informationfirst-hand.The 'clipper' alias is there for the benefit of those named above.  It is not a source for information, it was set up solely to monitor any initialtraffic.  Individuals on the list have requested that they continue to gettraffic that is not already duplicated on Usenet.While you can rightfully say we were a bit disorganized in handling this,I would ask that people stop speculating about any hidden agendas or motivesof the individuals on the 'clipper' alias - I've already apologized to themfor what's happened.  Disabling EXPN and VRFY is an increasingly commonpractice (albeit unfriendly to some), and any effect of disabling it againwas unintentional.-John Wack

Does it already exist?While I don't know the full scope of the activities of the EFF, from what little I've seen I think it would be better to lobby for strong cryptography through a distinct organization.The EFF has been associated with efforts to prevent the banning of sexand pictures newsgroups at various universities. Horror stories about thecontents of those groups (e.g. exploitative pictures of possibly underagedmodels) have already surfaced in the press. The White House bulletinalready raised the specter of drug-dealing and terrorism, which is only onestep removed from the old "crypto-wielding child molester" argument.  AnEFF lobbying effort for cryptography would be too easily derailed by theconnection to child pornography and the like.Similarly, LPF is connected with Stallman and his Gnu project.  Inlight of, say, the Gnu Manifesto, this means that in a public debate itstands to be labelled as "communist", "anarchist hackers", radical, etc.  I don't know about CPSR, but if it is an offshoot of Physicians for SocialResponsibility (best known for Helen Caldicott and her hystericalantinuclear lobbying) then it probably also carries unwelcome politicalbaggage.Perhaps for practical reasons a lobbying organization for cryptographywould best be formed under the umbrella of EFF or some other existinggroup, but its charter should then be distinct, independent, and limited toadvocacy for the right to cryptography.  To reiterate Dan Bernstein'squestion: does any suitable organization exist?  If not, what are you goingto do about it?Having mentioned the possible dangers of unwelcome political associations,I would be remiss not to suggest something in the opposite direction:gathering the support of the NRA by emphasizing the RKBA side of theissue as well as the First-Amendment side.Tal  kubo@math.harvard.edu

I won't startpanicking until/unless DES or RSA or stuff like that is prohibited, butI'm a little anxious.  (No doubt it won't be long before someone postsexplaining how this just a small part of some far-ranging andlong-lived NSA-PKP-IRS-FBI-CIA-HandgunControlInc-Clinton conspiracy tosubvert freedom, democracy, and mathematics.)  My feeling is that theadministration probably isn't that worried about things like DES andRSA and PGP and RIPEM, since they'll never be used by a group muchwider than us computer geeks.The fact that this just came out now suggests one of two things:1.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, and it only just    now happened to be ``ready'' to release to the world at this time.2.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, but wasn't able    to get the Bush administration to go along with this plan.  (I    find it unlikely that this would have been because of a sympathy    for the unescrowed use of cryptography; more likely the    administration felt that even escrowed, secret-algorithm and, for    all we know, trivially breakable cryptography should not be made    widely available.)Thus said clipper@csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (Clipper Chip Announcement):>This new technology will help companies protect proprietary>information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations>and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted>electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the>ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to>intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. The majority of the discussion involving this "Clipper Chip" seems topertain to the encryption of telephone conversations.  Does anyoneknow if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analogsignals?  The language sort of suggests this, but it's hard to say.The main thing I just don't get is whether this chip implementssymmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques.  Anybody know?I'm guessing symmetric, but they don't get very clear about it.  If itis symmetric, how is it useful for anything other than link-levelencryption with an identical chip at each end?  How can you negotiatea per-session key using symmetric cryptography without using a trustedthird party who knows your key?  (Or does it even use a per-sessionkey?)If it's asymmetric, what about PKP's patents, which they claim coverall methods of doing asymmetric cryptography?  Are they gettingroyalties, or is hiding infringement the real reason for keeping thealgorithm secret? :-)--Marc VanHeyningen   mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu   MIME & RIPEM acceptedKirk:  I won't hurt you.Alien: You hit me!Kirk:  Well, I won't hit you again.

To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is   first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.   S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a   64-bit block R1:   R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .   Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and   N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:     R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]    R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .   R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The   first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The   rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2   are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow   agencies.What happens is that the need for the Escrow houses is completely eliminated.Or should I say, the need to _access_ the Escrow houses to decrypt the data.The houses will still serve a real purpose as far as generating the illusionof protection, and small-town cops won't be let in on the "secret", so theywill still go through the motions of going to the Escrow houses, but the factis __the Federal government CAN and WILL build a chip which generates the unitkeys from the encrypted serial number!__  'Nuff Said.

I imagine that the chips are in a carrier whichwill allow them all to be programmed fairly quickly - there would not bea need to transfer chips one at a time into a little PLA programmer as somepeople have envisioned.My guess as to why this procedure is used is that basing the keys on theS1 and S2 using a specified algorithm provides an (in-principle) checkableway to verify that no back doors exist in the choice of the random numbersused to generate the keys.  Since we have to trust the escrow companiesanyway, it does not weaken the system to have the keys be generated fromrandom seeds entered by the escrow agents.  And since the algorithm forkey-generation is public (modulo Skipjack secrecy) then in principle anagent could challenge the procedure, ask for S1 and S2 to be exposed, andrun his own independent calculation of U1 and U2 to verify that that iswhat is actually being put onto the floppies.And yes, there are many ways in which failures to follow this scheme couldbe hard to check.  The laptop probably will not really be destroyed eachtime.  Hidden cameras in the ceiling could see the S1 and S2 entered bythe trusted escrow agents.  Back doors in the chip could allow U to berecovered.  Heck, each chip could be recorded with the same U, ignoringwhat was on the floppy.Hal Finney

Kaliski Jr. \\\\{\\tt burt@rsa.com} \\andMatthew J.B. Robshaw \\\\{\\tt matt@rsa.com} \\andRSA Laboratories \\\\100 Marine Parkway \\\\Redwood City, CA  94065}\\date{April 23, 1993}\\maketitleA message-digest algorithm maps a message of arbitrary length to a``digest'' of fixed length, and has three properties: Computing thedigest is easy, finding a message with a givendigest---``inversion''---is hard, and finding two messages with thesame digest---``collision''---is also hard. Message-digest algorithmshave many applications, including digital signatures and messageauthentication.RSA Data Security's MD5 message-digest algorithm, developed by RonRivest \\cite{rfc-md5}, maps a message to a 128-bit message digest.Computing the digest of a one-megabyte message takes as little as asecond.  While no message-digest algorithm can yet be {\\em proved}secure, MD5 is believed to be at least as good as any other that mapsto a 128-bit digest.  Inversion should take about $2^{128}$operations, and collision should take about $2^{64}$ operations.  Noone has found a faster approach to inversion or collision.Recent work by den Boer and Bosselaers \\cite{den-boer-md5} presentsa special kind of ``pseudocollision'' in MD5'sinternal compression function, which mapsa 512-bit message block $x$ and a128-bit input state $s$ to a 128-bit outputstate. They show how to find a message block $x$and two related input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ that yield the sameoutput state: $f(x,s_1)$ = $f(x,s_2)$. Their well-thought approachexploits structural properties of the collision function to find a pseudocollision in about $2^{16}$ operations, much less than onewould expect.Practical implications of this pseudocollision work to the security ofMD5 are not evident. While a real collision in MD5 implies apseudocollision (or a ``pseudo-inversion''), apseudocollision need not imply a real collision. Indeed, a realcollision, since it involves two different messages, would almostalways involve {\\em different} message blocks $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that$f(x_1,s_1) = f(x_2,s_2)$, but the pseudocollisions have the samemessage blocks. Moreover, the input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ wouldgenerally be unrelated, but the pseudocollisions' input states arethe same except for four bits.  There does not seem to be any way toextend den Boer and Bosselaers' approach to anything beyond thespecial pseudocollisions, a limitation they readily admit.It is reasonable, therefore, to believe that MD5 remains secure. While denBoer and Bosselaers have found interesting structural properties inMD5, the properties seem only to lead to special pseudocollisionsand not anything approaching real collisions. Further research, ofcourse, will give a better understanding of the strengths of MD5 andother message-digest algorithms, with the eventual hope thatsuch algorithms can, in some sense, be proved secure.\\bibliographystyle{plain}\\begin{thebibliography}{1}\\bibitem{den-boer-md5}Bert den~Boer and Antoon Bosselaers.\\newblock Collisions for the compression function of {MD5}.\\newblock In {\\it Advances in Cryptology --- Eurocrypt '93}, 1993.\\newblock Preprint.\\bibitem{rfc-md5}R.L.

Depending on his answer, this could be an appalling development   calling into question both DES and RSA/DES.not really.  in fact, public key based communication systems veryoften pick keys automatically which are much better than passwords orpass phrases.   If any bright programmer with a little idle machine time can crack   a single DES message in a couple of days (assuming no tricks that   are message-specific),if a person picked the password or pass phrase, then the key search ispretty straightforward.  in running english text, the average contentof a single word is about 8 bits.  in pass phrases, this may increaseto 10 bits or so.  searching 30bit spaces is semi-practical even insoftware and searching 40bit spaces isn't outrageous to imagine withhardware assists of moderate size.

It(this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by MarcVanHeyningen, <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to avariety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specificto RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.This month, I have reformatted this posting in an attempt to complywith the standards for HyperText FAQ formatting to allow easymanipulation of this document over the World Wide Web.  Let me knowwhat you think.DISCLAIMER----------Nothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anythingother than one person's opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talkto a real lawyer.QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS---------------------1)  What is RIPEM? RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) using the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows your electronic mail to have the properties of authentication (i.e. who sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can read it except the intended recipient.) RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>. Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines, which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.2)  How can I get RIPEM? RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or Canada.  Therefore, the following request is quoted from the README file: #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me, #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM. Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is included with the distribution.  You should read it before using RIPEM. The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy, since this will reduce the load on those sites that do carry it (not to mention the humans that run them.)  Naturally this requires that you trust the friend. RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for info.  Last I looked, this site contains only the source tree, and does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version. RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its "home site" on rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are available here in addition to the full source tree.3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine? Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports are expected, and help of users is invited.4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer? Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH. Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU Emacs. If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure, and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.5)  What is RSA? RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other, you may publish your encryption, or public key widely and keep your decryption, or private key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to decrypt it.  (Note that the "message" sent with RSA is normally just the DES key to the real message. (See "What is DES?") Note that the above only provides for privacy.  For authentication, the fingerprint of the message (See "What is a fingerprint, like MD5?") is encrypted with the sender's private key.  The recipient can use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message must have come from the sender. RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who invented it.  To find out more about RSA, ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt.6)  What is DES? DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA. RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter, allowing the recipient to recover the DES key. DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large corporation or government agency.  It is not unlikely that future RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher, possibly by using multiple encryption with DES.7)  What is PEM, and how does RIPEM relate? PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a system for allowing easy transfer of encrypted electronic mail.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115. RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.8)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys? For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important that this information be accurate; if a "bad guy" convinces her that his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read. RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server, the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution. None of them provide perfect security.9)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar? RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as those of lots of other people's keys. This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the same length, etc.10)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5? MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc. It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash, of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus, instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key, only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication. MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a passphrase interpreter or cookie generator. MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in RFC 1321.11)  What is PGP? PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy. PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently. PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA. Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM: - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without   a direct network connection. - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of   working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible   with anything other than PGP (in fact, PGP 1.0 is not compatible with   PGP 2.0.) - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security   Inc.  RSAREF comes with a license which allows noncommercial use.   PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed; thus,   PKP, the firm holding the U.S. patents on the RSA algorithm, claims   that it is a infringement of that patent to make, use or sell PGP in   the U.S. or Canada.  In acknowledgement of this, PGP's original   author, Phil Zimmermann, says in the documentation:   #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency,    #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public   #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is   #contraband.   - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside   the U.S. and Canada.  However, PGP already exists on many ftp sites   in Europe and other places. Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues. Note that the above facts, both regarding patent and export restrictions, are somewhat controversial; many people think it shouldn't be that way, and some people interpret various documents differently.  Unfortunately, discussions of it on the net inevitably seem to produce more heat than light, and probably belong in misc.legal.computing.  (See:  "DISCLAIMER")12)  What about RPEM? RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM, but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in an attempt to avoid the patent on RSA.  It was written by Mark Riordan, the same author as RIPEM. Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many (including Rabin), Public Key Partners (PKP) claimed that their patent was broad enough to cover any public-key cipher whose strength rested in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes, not just RSA. This claim is not universally accepted by any means, but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons. RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.13)  What is MIME? MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup comp.mail.mime.  How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely clear; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones.  I hope some standards will emerge.  Draft Internet documents exist on the matter.14)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM... You may wish to check the companion post "ripem-attacks" which discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEM's security and what procedures will minimize the risk.  RIPEM's main "weak area" is probably key distribution.

Sci., Urbana, ILDate: Fri, 16 Apr 1993 21:01:10 GMTLines: 107[An article from comp.org.eff.news, EFFector Online 5.06 - Carl]                       April 16, 1993      INITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY                             PROPOSAL       The Clinton Administration today made a major announcement on cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of millions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as export controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to robust encryption as well as law enforcement issues posed by new technology.       However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the National Security Agency. The so-called "Clipper Chip" is an 80-bit, split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow agents would store users' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  The encryption scheme used is to be classified, but they chips will be available to any manufacturer for incorporation into their communications products.       This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .       First, the Administration appears to be adopting a solution before conducting an inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper chip may not be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes. Furthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for Clipper or any other chips.  Rather,independent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.       Second, an algorithm can not be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  The public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny.         Third, while the use of the split-key, dual-escrowed system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is adopted.  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys?  Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive individual's fifth amendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?         In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy and security.  However, the "Clipper chip" solution ought to be considered as part of the inquiry, not be adopted before the discussion even begins.DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:ESCROWThe 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whom hold 40 bits of each key.  Upon presentation of a valid warrant, the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  Most likely the Attorney General will be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the Administration have suggested one non-law enforcement federal agency, perhaps the Federal Reserve, and one non-governmental organization.  But, there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.Key registration would be done by the manufacturer of the communications device.  A key is tied to the device, not to the person using it.CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORSThe Administration claims that there are no back door means by which the government or others could break the code without securing keys from the escrow agents and that the President will be told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order to prove this, Administration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto cracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine the algorithm for trap doors.  The results of the investigation would then be made public.GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVERIn order to get a market moving, and to show that the government believes in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customers for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, VP Al Gore, and maybe even the President. FROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:Jerry Berman, Executive DirectorDaniel J.

The real fear comes fromthem doing more than this.This is a voluntary program, and thus harder for us to object to onthe surface.Their strategy is a business one rather than legal one.  They arepushing to get a standard in place, a secret standard, and if theyget it as a standard then they will drive competitors out of the market.It will be legal to sell better, untapable encryption that doesn't haveregistered keys, but it will be difficult, and thus not a plan formost phone companies.You see, with clipper chip phones you'll be able to talk to anycellular company, or other phones or ports because they will followthe standard.  AT&T has already announced a clipper chip encryptionproduct.  The government has marketed hard to get major vendors touse these chips.   If they get enough market share, they will rule.And thus there will be very little market for systems that can't betapped by the police.  The public isn't that concerned about it now,after all.  They freely do calls that anybody with an old TV can listento today!  They won't pay big extra bucks for proprietary phones that securethem only from the police.Well, some people will buy these phones, but they will only work withother proprietary phones, so the market will be small and the phonesexpensive.  Unless they are made in numbers large enough to sell themcheap, only the Mob will buy them.And this means that the FBI will want to track the customer lists ofbetter encryption phones, because "the only reason a person would wantone is to evade the police."Interesting.-- Brad Templeton, ClariNet Communications Corp. -- Sunnyvale, CA 408/296-0366

ATT's last product in this area (a) was priced over$1000, as I suspect 'clipper' phones will be; (b) came to the customer with the key automatically preregistered with government authorities. Thus,aside from attempting to further legitimize and solidify the fed's posture,Clipper seems to be "more of the same", rather than a new direction.   Yes, technology will eventually drive the cost down and thereby promotemore widespread use- but at present, the man on the street is not goingto purchase a $1000 crypto telephone, especially when the guy on the otherend probably doesn't have one anyway.  Am I missing something?   The real question is what the gov will do in a year or two when air-tight voice privacy on a phone line is as close as your nearest pc.

With each phone broadcasting the serial number of its chip        ("E(N;F)" is not syntactically different than "N"), all they        have to do is aim a reciever in the general direction of        today's target and use the serial number to identify the        session they want, and get the chip number of the other end of        the conversation. Even without the key, this is great for        traffic analysis. I can think of several ways to learn the        right serial number.        It looks like one intended effect of the Clipper is to        eliminate the awkward business of getting the telco to        cooperate (or risking getting caught in the act with your        alligator clips erect). This is particularly handy if you have        S1 and S2.        BTW, did anyone explain why they are scrambling the serial        number?

In Manchester, CT a few years ago, a small company wanted to run agame system galled "LaserGames," similar in many aspects to Photon(tm). Three lawyers and about a hundred citizens found an ancient lawin Manchester's books which clearly from context was designed toprohibit travelling carnivals by enumerating the features of a carnivalwhich they felt at the time made the prohibition obvious. Among thesethings was "shooting galleries," which is what the lawyers for theopposition to LaserGames wanted to harp upon. The judge took the twowords from this law, completely out of context, and ruled thatLaserGames could not operate in Manchester.  Keep in mind that most travelling carnivals use projectile weapons intheir shooting galleries, and not light beams. Clearly from context,LaserGames got shafted, but if the two words are applied, their denialof operating permission was justified.  If I had the text of the law I'd post it, but I'm afraid I don'tremember it all well enough to even try. That little bit with the twowords stuck well, though.:John Dormer:jad@expert.cc.purdue.edu

Helsingius?* * *IDENTITY========_____<1.1> What is `identity' on the internet?  Generally, today people's `identity' on the internet is primarily  determined by their email address in the sense that this is their  most unchanging 'face' in the electronic realm.   This is your  login name qualified by the complete address domain information,  for example ``ld231782@longs.lance.colostate.edu''.  People see  this address when receiving mail or reading USENET posts from you  and in other situations where programs record usage.  Some obsolete  forms of addresses (such as BITNET) still persist.  In email messages, additional information on the path that a message  takes is prepended to the message received by the recipient.  This  information identifies the chain of hosts involved in the  transmission and is a very accurate trace of its origination.  This  type of identify-and-forward protocol is also used in the USENET  protocol to a lesser extent.  Forging these fields requires  corrupted mailing software at sites involved in the forwarding and  is very uncommon.  Not so uncommon is forging the chain at the  origination point, so that all initial sites in the list are faked  at the time the message is created.  Tracing these messages can be  difficult or impossible when the initial faked fields are names of  real machines and represent real transfer routes._____<1.2> Why is identity (un)important on the internet?  The concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication,  privacy, and security, which in turn are all critical aspects of  computer networks. For example, the convenience of communication  afforded by email would be impossible without conventions for  identification.  But there are many potential abuses of identity  possible that can have very severe consequences, with massive  computer networks at the forefront of the issue, which can  potentially either exacerbate or solve these problems.  Verifying that an identity is correct is called `authentication',  and one classic example of the problems associated with it is  H.G.Well's ``War of the Worlds'' radio broadcast that fooled  segments of the population into thinking that an alien invasion was  in progress.  Hoaxes of this order are not uncommon on Usenet and  forged identities makes them more insidious.  People and their  reputations can be assaulted by forgery.  However, the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of  its most attractive features. Identity is just as useful as it is  harmful.  A professor might carefully explain a topic until he  finds he is talking to an undergraduate. A person of a particular  occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally  shun him.  Some prejudices are erased, but, on the other hand, many  prejudices are useful!  A scientist might argue he can better  evaluate the findings of a paper as a reviewer if he knows more  about the authors.  Likewise, he may be more likely to reject it  based on unfair or irrelevant criteria.  On the other side of the  connection,  the author may find identities of reviewers useful in  exerting pressure for acceptance.  Identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating  `credit' (not necessarily financial) and `ownership' and `usage'.   Many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques  for identification. Heavy reliance will be placed on digital  authentication as global economies become increasingly electronic.   Many government functions and services are based on identification,  and law enforcement frequently hinges on it.  Hence, employees of  many government organizations push toward stronger identification  structures.  But when does identification invade privacy?  The growth of the internet is provoking social forces of massive  proportions. Decisions made now on issues of identity will affect  many future users, especially as the network becomes increasingly  global, universal, widespread, and entrenched; and the positive or  adverse affects of these actions, intended and inadvertent,  will  literally be magnified exponentially._____<1.3> How does my email address (not) identify me and my background?  Your email address may contain information that influences people's  perceptions of your background.  The address may `identify' you as  from a department at a particular university, an employee at a  company, or a government worker.  It may contain your last name,  initials, or cryptic identification codes independent of both.  In  the US some are based on parts of social security numbers.  Others  are in the form 'u2338' where the number is incremented in the  order that new users are added to the system.  Standard internet addresses  also can contain information  on your  broad geographical location or nationhood.  However, none of this  information is guaranteed to be correct or be there at all.  The  fields in the domain qualification of the username are based on  rather arbitrary organization, such as (mostly invisible) network  cabling distributions.  The only point to make is that early fields  in the address are more specific (such as specific computer names  or local networks) and the later ones the most general (such as  continental domains).  Typically the first field is the name of the  computer receiving mail.  Gleaning information from the email address alone is sometimes an  inspired art or an inconsistent and futile exercise.  (For more  information, see the FAQs on email  addresses and known  geographical distributions below.)  However, UNIX utilities exist  to aid in the quest (see the question on this).  Common Suffixes  ---------------  .us    United States  .uk    United Kingdom  .ca    Canada  .fi    Finland  .au    Australia  .edu   university or college  .com   commercial organization  .org   'other' (e.g. nonprofit organization)  .gov   government  .mil   military site _____<1.4> How can I find out more about somebody with a given email address?  One simple way is to send email to that address, asking.  Another  way is to send mail to the postmaster at that address (i.e.  postmaster@address), although the postmaster's job is more to help  find user ID's of particular people given their real name and solve  mail routing problems.  The sysadmin (i.e. `root@address') may also  be able to supply information.  Users with related email address  may have information.  However, all of these methods rely on the  time and patience of others so use them minimally.  One of the most basic tools for determining identity over the  internet is the UNIX utility 'finger'.  The basic syntax is:    finger user@here.there.everywhere  This utility uses communication protocols to query the computer  named in the address for information on the user named.  The  response is generated completely by the receiving computer and may  be in any format.  Possible responses are as follows:  - A message `unknown host' meaning some aspect of the address is    incorrect, two lines with no information and '???'.    - A message 'In real life: ???' in which case the receiving computer    could not find any kind of a match on the username. The finger    utility may return this response in other situations.    - A listing of information associated with multiple users. Some    computers will search only for matching user IDs, others will    attempt to find the username you specified as a substring of all    actual full names of users kept in a local database.    At some sites 'finger' can be used to get a list of all users on the  system with a `finger @address'.  In general this is often  considered weak security, however, because `attackers' know valid  user ID's to `crack' passwords.  More information on the fields returned by `finger' is given below.   More information on `finger' and locating people's email addresses  is given in the email FAQ (such as the WHOIS lookup utility).  Just  as you can use these means to find out about others, they can use  them to find out about you.  You can `finger' yourself to find out  what is publicly reported by your UNIX system about you.  Be  careful when modifying `finger' data; virtually anyone with  internet access worldwide can query this information.  In one  amazing case, the New York Times writer J. Markoff uncovered the  identity of R. Morris, author of the Internet Worm,  through  the use of an anonymous tip and 'finger'.  See the book Cyberspace  by K. Hafner and J. Markoff._____<1.5> Why is identification (un)stable on the internet?  Generally, identity is an amorphous and almost nonexistent concept  on the Internet for a variety of reasons.  One is the inherent  fluidity of `cyberspace' where people emerge and submerge  frequently, and absences are not readily noted in the `community'.   Most people remember faces and voices, the primary means of casual  identification in the 'real world'.  The arbitary and cryptic   sequences of letters and digits comprising most email addresses are  not particularly noticeable or memorable and far from a unique  identification of an individual, who may use multiple accounts on  multiple machines anywhere in the world.  Currently internet users do not really have any great assurances  that the messages in email and USENET are from who they appear to  be. A person's mailing address is far from an identification of an  individual.      - Anyone with access to the account, e.g. they know the password,    either legitimately or otherwise, can send mail with that address    in the From: line.    - Email addresses for an individual tend to change frequently as    they switch jobs or make moves inside their organizations.   - As part of current mailing protocol standards, forging the From:    line in mail messages is a fairly trivial operation for many    hackers.      The status and path information prepended to messages by  intermediate hosts is generally unforgeable. In general, while  possible, forgeries are fairly rare on most newsgroups and in  email.  Besides these pathological cases abve there are many basic  problems with today's internet protocols affecting identification  on the internet:  - Internet mail standards, described in RFC-822, are still evolving    rapidly and not entirely orderly.  For example, standards for    mail address `munging' or `parsing' tend to vary slightly between    sites and frequently mean the difference between finding    addresses and bouncing mail.    - Domain names and computer names are frequently changed at sites,    and there are delays in the propagation of this data.    - Addresses cannot be resolved when certain critical computers    crash, such as the receiving computer or other computers involved    in resolving names into addresses called `nameservers'.     - A whole slew of problems is associated with  `nameservers'; if    they are not updated they will not find name addresses, and even    the operation of what constitutes `updating' has different    interpretations at different sites.    The current internet mailing and addressing protocols are slightly  anachronistic in that they were created when the network was  somewhat obscure and not widespread, with only a fraction of the  traffic it now sees.  Today a large proportion of internet traffic  is email, comprising  millions of messages._____<1.6> What is the future of identification on the internet?  Some new technologies and standards are introducing facial images  and voice messages  into mail and these will improve the sense of  community that comes from the familiarity of identification.  However, they are not currently widespread, require large amounts  of data transfer, standardized software, and make some compromises  in privacy.  Promising new cryptographic techniques may make 'digital signatures'  and 'digital authentication' common (see below).  Also, the trend  in USENET standards is toward greater authentication of posted  information.  On the other hand, advances in ensuring anonymity  (such as remailers) are forthcoming.  See below.PRIVACY=======_____<2.1> What is `privacy' on the internet?  Generally, while `privacy' has multiple connotations in society and  perhaps even more on the internet, in cyberspace most take it to  mean that you have exclusive use and access to your account and the  data stored on and and directed to it (such as email), and you do  not encounter arbitrary restrictions or searches.  In other words,   others may obtain data associated with your account, but not  without your permission.  These ideas are probably both fairly  limiting and liberal in their scope in what most internet users  consider their private domains.  Some users don't expect or want  any privacy, some expect and demand it._____<2.2> Why is privacy (un)important on the internet?  This is a somewhat debatable and inflammatory topic, arousing  passionate opinions.  On the internet, some take privacy for  granted and are rudely surprised to find it tenuous or nonexistent.  Most governments have rules that protect privacy (such as the  illegal search and seizure clause of the U.S. constitution, adopted  by others) but have many that are antithetical to it (such as laws  prohibiting secret communications or allowing wiretapping). These  rules generally carry over to the internet with few specific rules  governing it.  However, the legal repercussions of the global  internet are still largely unknown and untested (i.e. no strong  legal precedents and court cases).  The fact that internet traffic  frequently passes past international boundaries, and is not  centrally managed, significantly complicates and strongly  discourages its regulation._____<2.3> How (in)secure are internet networks?  - `Theoretically' people at any site in the chain of sites with    access to hardware and network media that transmits data over the    Internet  could potentially monitor or archive it. However, the    sheer volume and general 'noise' inherent to this data makes    these scenarios highly improbable, even by government agencies    with supposedly vast funding and resources.    - Technologies exist to `tap' magnetic fields given off by    electrical wires without detection.  Less obscurely, any machine    with a network connection is a potential station for traffic    detection, but this scenario requires knowledge and access to    very low-level hardware (the network card) to pursue, if even    possible.    - A company Network General Inc. is one of many that manufactures    and markets sophisticated network monitoring tools that can    'filter' and read packets by arbitrary criteria for    troubleshooting purposes, but the cost of this type of device is    prohibitive for casual use.  Known instances of the above types of security  breaches at a major  scale (such as at network hubs) are very rare. The greatest risks  tend to emerge locally.  Note that all these approaches are almost  completely defused with the use of cryptography.    _____<2.4> How (in)secure is my account?  By default, not very.  There are a multitude of factors that may  reinforce or compromise aspects of your privacy on the internet.   First, your account must be secure from other users. The universal  system is to use a password, but if it is `weak' (i.e. easy to  guess) this security is significantly diminished.  Somewhat  surprisingly and frighteningly to some, certain  users of the  system, particularly the administrator, generally have unlimited  access regardless of passwords, and may grant that access to  others.  This means that they may read any file in your account  without detection.  Furthermore, not universally known, most UNIX systems keep fairly  extensive accounting records of when and where you logged in, what  commands you execute, and when they are executed (in fact, login  information is usually public). Most features of this `auditing' or   `process accounting' information are enabled by default after the  initial installation and the system administrator may customize it  to strengthen or weaken it to satisfy performance or privacy aims.   This information is frequently consulted for troubleshooting  purposes and may otherwise be ignored.  This data tracks  unsuccessful login attempts and other 'suspicious' activities on  the system. A traditional part of the UNIX system that tracks user  commands is easily circumvented by the user with the use of  symbolic links (described  in 'man ln').    UNIX implementations vary widely particularly in tracking features  and new sophisticated mechanisms are introduced by companies  regularly. Typically system adminstrators augment the basic UNIX  functionality with public-domain programs and locally-developed  tools for monitoring, and use them only to isolate `suspicious'  activity as it arises (e.g. remote accesses to the 'passwd' file, incorrect  login attempts, remote connection attempts, etc.).    Generally, you should expect little privacy on your account for  various reasons:    - Potentially, every keystroke you type could be intercepted by    someone else.   - System administrators make extensive backups that are completely    invisible to users which may record the states of an account over    many weeks.   - Erased files can, under many operating systems, be undeleted.   - Most automated services keep logs of use for troubleshooting or    otherwise; for example FTP sites usually log the commands and    record the domain originations of users, including anonymous    ones.  - Some software exacerbates these problems.  See the section on    ``X Windows (in)security''.  Indepedent of malevolent administrators are fellow users, a much  more commonly harmful threat. There are multiple ways to help  ensure that your account will not be accessed by others, and  compromises can often be traced to failures in these guidelines:  - Choose a secure password.  Change it periodically.  - Make sure to logout always.  - Do not leave a machine unattended for long.  - Make sure no one watches you when you type your password.  - Avoid password references in email.  - Be conservative in the use of the .rhost file.  - Use utilities like `xlock' to protect a station, but be    considerate.  Be wary of situations where you think you should supply your  password.  There are only several basic situations where UNIX  prompts you for a password: when you are logging in to a system or  changing your password.  Situations can arise in which prompts for  passwords are forged by other users, especially in cases where you  are talking to them (such as Internet Relay Chat).  Also, be  aware  that forged login screens are one method to illegitimately obtain   passwords.  (Thanks to Jim Mattson <mattson@cs.ucsd.edu> for contributions  here.)_____<2.5> How (in)secure are my files and directories?  The most important privacy considerations are related to file  rights, and many lapses can be traced to their misunderstood nature  or haphazard maintenance. Be aware of the rights associated with  your files and directories in UNIX. If the `x' (`execute') right on  your parent directory is off for users, groups, and other, these  users cannot gain information on anything in your directories.   Anything less may allow others to read, change, or even delete  files in your home directory. The rights on a directory supersede  the rights associated with files in that directory. For a  directory, 'x' means that access to the files (or subdirectories)  in the directory is possible -- if you know their names.  To list  the contents of the directory, however, requires the 'r' right.   By default most accounts are accessable only to the owner, but the  initial configuration varies between sites based on administrator  preference.  The default file mode specifies the initial rights  associated with newly created files, and can be set in the shell  with `umask'.  The details of rights implementations tend to vary  between versions of UNIX.  Consult man pages on `chmod' and `ls'.  Examples  --------    traver.lance % ls -ld ~    drwx------ 15 ld231782     1536 Jan 31 21:22 /users/ld231782/  Here is a listing of the rights associated with a user's home  directory, denoted by `~'.  The columns at the left identify what  rights are available. The first column identifies the entry as a  directory, and the next three columns mean that read, write, and  execute rights, respectively, are permitted for that user.  For  directories, the `x' right means that contents (file and  subdirectory names) within that directory can be listed. The  subsequent columns indicate that no other users have any rights to  anything in the directory tree originating at that point.  They  can't even `see' any lower files or subdirectories; the hierarchy  is completely invisible to them.    traver.lance % ls -l msg    -rw-r--r--  1 ld231782   35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg    traver.lance % chmod u=rw,g=,o= msg    traver.lance % ls -l msg    -rw-------  1 ld231782   35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg  Here the modes on the file `msg' were changed to take away rights  from `group' and `other'.     Note that `ls -l <file>' requires both the 'r' right to get the list  of files and subdirectories, and the 'x' right to access the files  and subdirectories in order to get their size, etc. For example,  suppose the directory `foo' has rights dr--r--r--,  the following  is possible:    ls foo  These commands would fail independent of file rights:      ls -l foo    ls -l foo/file    cat foo/file    cd foo  If the directory `foo' has rights d--x--x--x, the following are  possible if it is known beforehand that `foo' contains an 'r'  readable file named `file':      ls -l foo/file    cat foo/file    cd foo    The following commands fail:      ls foo    ls -l foo    (Thanks to Uwe Waldmann <uwe@mpi-sb.mpg.de> for contributions here.)_____<2.6> How (in)secure is X Windows?  X Windows is the primary software developed by the MIT Athena  project which is funded by U.S. government grants to develop  applications to harness the power of networks in enhancing  computational tasks, particularly the human-computer interface.   The software implements a client-server interface to a computer via  graphical windows. In this case the `client' is the application  requesting or utilizing  graphical resources (such as windows or a  mouse) and the `server' is the machine that provides them.  In many  situations the client is an application program running on the same  machine as the server.  The great utility of X Windows comes from its complete dissociation  of the client and server so that windows may be `broadcast' to a  server at a remote location from the  client. Unfortunately this  dynamic power also introduces many deep, intricate, and complicated  security considerations.  The primary security and privacy issue  associated with X Windows is that much more sensitive data may be  sent over a network, and over wider regions, than in the case where  the human is situated near the host computer.  Currently there is  no encryption of data such as screen updates and keystrokes in X  Windows.  Due to either intentional design decisions or unintentional design  flaws,  early versions of the X Window system are extremely  insecure. Anyone with an account on the server machine can disrupt  that display or read it electronically based on access to the  device unix:0.0 by any regular user.   There are no protections  from this type of access in these versions.   The problem arises  because the security is completely based on machine addresses  rather than users, such that any user at a `trusted' machine is  himself trusted. Quoting from X documentation (man Xsecurity):    > Any client on a host in the host access control list is allowed  > access to the X server. This system can work reasonably well in  > an environment where everyone trusts everyone, or when only a  > single person can log into a given machine...This system does not  > work well when multiple people can log in to a single machine and  > mutual trust does not exist.     With the access control list, the `xhost' command may prevent some  naive attempts (i.e. those other than the direct-access unix:0.0  evasion); the syntax as typed on the host machine is  ``xhost  +[name]'' where [name] is the domain name or internet address of an  authorized client machine. By default clients running nonlocal to  the host are disabled.  Public domain programs to disrupt a display  momentarily (such as 'flip' or slowly mirror the screen image, or  cause pixels to 'melt' down to the bottom) have been circulating on  the internet among hackers for several years and played as pranks  on unsuspecting or inexperienced users.  Much more serious security  breaches are conceivable from similar mechanisms exploiting this  inherent weaknesses.  (The minimal, easily-bypassed `trusted'  security mode of `xhost' has been jokingly referred to as ``X  Hanging Open, Security Terrible.'').   New versions of the X Window system (X11R5 and higher) by default   make server access as secure as the file system using a .Xauthority  file and 'magic cookies'.  Remote machines must have a code in the  .Xauthority file in the home directory that matches the code  allowed by the server.  Many older programs and even new  vendor-supplied code does not support or is incompatible with  `magic cookies'. The basic magic cookie mechanism is vulnerable to  monitoring techniques described earlier because no encryption of  keys occurs in transmission.  X11R5 also includes other  sophisticated encryption mechanisms.  Try `man Xsecurity' to find  out what is supported at your site.  Even though improved security   mechanisms have been available in X Windows since ~1990, local  sites often update this software infrequently because installation  is extremely complex.

By default, not very.  The characters that you are reading are  almost certainly encoded in ASCII, the American Standard Code for  Information Interchange that maps alphabetic and symbolic  characters onto numeric codes and vice versa.  Virtually every  computer system uses this code, and if not, has ways of converting  to and from it.  When you write a mail message, by default it is  being sent in ASCII,  and since the standard is virtually  universal, there is no intrinsic privacy.  Despite milleniums worth  of accumulated cryptographic knowledge, cryptographic technologies  are only recently being established that afford high priority to  privacy as a primary criteria in computer and network design.  Some  potential pitfalls in privacy are as follows:  - The most serious threats are instances of immature or unscrupulous    system operators reading private mail in the `spool files' at a    local site (i.e. at the source or destination of the message),    such as a university.     - System administrators may also release files to law enforcement    agencies, but conventions and protocols for warrants involving    computer searches have still not been strongly established and    tested legally.  - Note that bounced messages go to postmasters at a given site in    their entirety.  This means that if you address mail with an    incorrect address it has a good chance of being seen by a human    other than the recipient.  - Typically new user accounts are always set up such that the local    mail directory is private, but this is not guaranteed and can be    overridden.  - Finally, be aware that some mailing lists (email addresses of     everyone on a list) are actually publicly accessable via mail     routing software mechanisms.  This `feature' can be disabled.  Most potential compromises in email privacy can be thoroughly  avoided with the use of strong end-to-end cryptography, which has  its own set of caveats (for example, unscrupulous administrators  may still be a threat if the encryption site is shared or  nonlocal).  See the sections on ``email privacy'' and ``email  policies.''_____<2.8> How am I (not) liable for my email and postings?  As punishment or whatever, your system administrator can revoke  certain `privileges' such as emailing, USENET posting or reading  certain groups, file transferring, remote communications, or  generally any subset of capabilities available from your account.   This all is completely at the discretion of the local administrator  and under the procedures followed at a particular site, which in  many cases are haphazard and crisis-oriented.  Currently there are  virtually no widespread, uniform guidelines or procedures  for  restricting use to any internet services, and local administrators  are free to make arbitrary decisions on access.  Today punitive measures are regularly applied in various situations.  In the typical scenario complaint(s) reach a system adminstrator  regarding abuses by a user, usually but not necessarily preceded by  complaints to the user in email, regarding that person's  objectionable email or postings.  `abusive' posters to USENET are  usually first given admonitions from their system administrators as  urged by others on the `net'. (The debate persists endlessly on  many newsgroups whether this is also used  as a questionable means  of attacking or silencing `harmless crackpots' or censoring  unpopular opinions.)    System administrators at remote sites regularly cooperate to  'squelch' severe cases of abuse.  In general, however, by tradition  Usenet readers are remarkably tolerant of diverse views and uses of  the system, but a colorful vocabularly of slang helps describe  their alternatives when this patience is sapped: the options  wielded by the individual user are to simply advance to the next  message (referred to as ``hitting the `n' key''), or to `plonk'  annoying posters (according to the Hacker's Dictionary, the sound a  jerk makes at the end of a fall to the bottom of a kill file).  In cases where punitive actions are applied, generally system  administrators are least likely to restrict email.  USENET postings  are much more commonly restricted, either to individual users or   entire groups (such as a university campus).  Restrictions are most  commonly associated with the following `abuses':  - harassing or threatening notes, `email terrorism'  - illegal uses, e.g. piracy or propagation of copyrighted material  - `ad hominem' attacks, i.e. insulting the reputation of the    poster instead of citing the content of the message  - intentional or extreme vulgarity and offensiveness  - inappropriate postings, esp. binary files in regular groups    `mail-bombing': inundating mail boxes with numerous or massive    files  Major problems originate from lack of distinctions in private and  official email or postings.  Most users have internet access via  accounts at businesses or universities and their activities on the  internet can be construed as representative of their parent  organizations. Many people put disclaimers in their `signatures' in  an attempt dissociate their identity and activities from parent  organizations as a precaution. A recent visible political case  involves the privacy of electronic mail  written by White House  staff members of the Bush administration.  Following are some  guidelines:  - Acquaint yourself with your company or university policy.  - If possible, avoid use of your company email address for private    communication.  - Use a disclaimer.  - Keep a low profile (avoid `flamewars' or simply don't post).  - Avoid posting information that could be  construed to be    proprietary or `internal'.  The following references are available from ftp.eff.com  (see also the section on ``internet use policies''):  /pub/academic/banned.1991  /pub/academic/banned.1992  ---    Computer material that was banned/challenged in academia in 1991    and 1992 including USENET hierarchies.  /pub/academic/cases  ---    This is an on-line collection of information about specific    computers and academic freedom cases. File README is a detailed    description of the items in the directory.  /pub/academic/faq/netnews.liability  ---    Notes on university liability for Usenet._____<2.9> How do I provide more/less information to others on my identity?  The public information of your identity and account is mostly  available though the UNIX utility `finger' described above.     - You have control over most of this information with the utility    `chfn', the specifics vary between sites (on some systems use    `passwd -f').     - You can provide unlimited information in the .plan file which is    copied directly to the destination during the fingering.       - A technique that works at some sites allows you to find out who is    'finger'ing you and even to  vary the .plan file sent to them.      - Your signature is determined by the environment variable SIGNATURE      - USENET signatures are conventionally stored in the .signature file    in your home directory.      Providing less information on your online identity is more difficult  and involved.  One approach is to ask your system adminstrator to  change or delete information about you (such as your full name).   You may be able to obtain access on a public account or one from  someone unrelated to you personally.  You may be able to remotely  login (via modem or otherwise) to computers that you are not  physically near.  These are tactics for hiding or masking your  online activities but nothing is foolproof.  Consult man pages on  the 'chmod' command and the default file mode.  Generally, files on  a shared system have good safeguards within the user pool but very  little protection is possible from corrupt system administrators.  To mask your identity in email or on USENET you can use different  accounts. More untraceable are new `anonymous posting' and  remailing services that are very recently being established.  See  below.______<2.10> Who is my sysadmin?  What does s/he know about me?  The requirements and screening for getting a system administration  job (and thereby access to all information on a system) vary widely  between sites and are sometimes frighteningly lax, especially at  universities.  Many UNIX systems at universities are largely  managed by undergraduates with a background in computing and often  `hacking'.  In general, commercial and industrial sites are more  strict on qualifications and background, and government sites are  extremely strict.  The system adminstrator (root user) can monitor what commands you  used and at what times.  S/he may have a record (backups) of files  on your account over a few weeks. S/he can monitor when  you send  email or post USENET messages, and potentially read either.  S/he  may have access to records indicating what hosts you are using,  both locally and elsewhere.  Administrators sometimes employ  specialized programs to  track `strange' or `unusual' activity,  which can potentially be misused.______<2.11> Why is privacy (un)stable on the internet?  For the numerous reasons listed above, privacy should not be an  expectation with current use of the internet.  Furthermore, large  parts of the internet are funded by the U.S. NSF (National Science  Foundation) which places certain restrictions on its use (such as  prohibiting commercial use).  Some high-level officials in this and  other government agencies may be opposed to emerging techniques to  guarantee privacy (such as encryption and anonymous services).  Historically the major threats to privacy on the internet have been  local. Perhaps the most common example of this are the widespread  occurrences of university administrators refusing to carry some  portion of USENET newsgroups labelled as `pornographic'. The  `alternative' hierarchy in the USENET system, which has virtually  no restrictions on propagation and new group creation, is  frequently targeted (although this material may appear anywhere).  From the global point of view traffic is generally completely  unimpeded on the internet  and only the most egregious offenders  are pursued.  For example,  verbatim transcriptions of copyrighted  material (such as newspaper or magazine articles) are posted to  USENET with regularity without major consequences (some email  complaints may ensue).  More astonishing to some is that currently  significant portions of USENET traffic, and less so internet  traffic, is comprised of sexually-explicit digitized images almost  entirely originating from copyrighted material (newsgroups such as  `alt.sex' regularly have the  highest traffic).  ______<2.12> What is the future of privacy on the internet?  Some argue that the internet currently has an adequate or  appropriate level of privacy.  Others will argue that as a  prototype for future global networks it has woefully inadequate  safeguards.  The internet is growing to become a completely global,  international superhighway for data, and this traffic will  inevitably entail data such as voice messages, postal mail, and  many other items of extremely personal nature. Computer items that  many people consider completely private (such as their local hard  drives) will literally be inches from global network connections.  Also, sensitive industrial and business information is exchanged  over networks currently and this volume may conceivably merge with  the internet.    Most would agree that, for these basic but sensitive uses of the  internet, no significant mechanisms are currently in place to  ensure much privacy. New standards are calling for uniform  introduction of `privacy enhanced mail' (PEM) which uses encryption  technologies to ensure privacy, so that privacy protection is  automatic, and may significantly improve safeguards.  The same technology that can be extremely destructive to privacy  (such as with  surreptitious surveilance) can be overwhelmingly  effective in protecting  it (e.g. with encryption). Some government  agencies are opposed to unlimited privacy in general, and believe  that it should lawfully be forfeited in cases of criminal conduct  (e.g. court-authorized wiretapping).  However, powerful new  technologies to protect privacy on computers are becoming  increasingly popular, provoking some to say that ``the cat is out  of the bag'' and the ``genie can't be put back in the bottle''.  In  less idiomatic terms, they believe that the spread of strong  cryptography is already underway will be socially and technically  unstoppable.    To date, no feasible system that guarantees both secure  communication and government oversight has been proposed (the two  goals are largely incompatible). Proposals for ``registration'' of  secret keys (by D. Denning on sci.crypt, for example) have been met  with hot controversy at best and ridicule and derision at worst,  mainly because of concerns for the right to privacy and objections  of inherent feasibility.  Electronic privacy issues, and  particularly the proper roles of networks and the internet, will  foreseeably become highly visible and explosive over the next few  years.ANONYMITY=========_____<3.1> What is `anonymity' on the internet?  Simply stated, anonymity is the absence of identity, the  ultimate in privacy. However, there are several variations on  this simple theme.  A person may wish to be consistently  identified by a certain pseudonym or `handle' and establish a  reputation under it in some area, providing pseudo-anonymity.  A person may wish to be completely untraceable for a single  one-way message (a sort of `hit-and-run'). Or, a person may  wish to be openly anonymous but carry on a conversation with  others (with either known or anonymous identities) via an  `anonymous return address'.  A user may wish to appear as a  `regular user' but actually be untraceable.  Sometimes a user  wishes to hide who he is sending mail to (in addition to the  message itself). The anonymous item itself may be directed at  individuals or groups.  A user may wish to access some  service and hide all  signs of the association.     All of these uses are feasible on the internet but are currently  tricky to carry out in practice, because of all the tracking  mechanisms inherent to operating systems and network protocols.   Officials of the NSF and other government agencies may be opposed  to any of these uses because of the potential for abuse.   Nevertheless, the inherent facelessness of large networks will  always guarantee a certain element of anonymity._____<3.2> Why is `anonymity' (un)important on the internet?  Anonymity is another powerful tool that can be beneficial or  problematic depending on its use.  Arguably absence of  identification is important as the presence of it.  It may be the  case that many strong benefits from electronic anonymity will be  discovered that were unforeseen and unpredicted, because true  anonymity has been historically very difficult to establish.  One can use anonymity to make personal statements to a colleague  that would sabotage a relationship if stated openly (such as  employer/employee scenarios).  One can use it to pass information  and evade any threat of direct retribution.  For example,  `whistleblowers' reporting on government abuses (economic, social,  or  political) can bring issues to light without fear of stigma or  retaliation. Sensitive, personal, potentially damaging information  is often posted to some USENET groups, a risky situation where  anonymity allows conversations to be carried on completely  independent of the identities of the participants.  Some police  departments run phone services that allow anonymous reporting of  crimes; such uses would be straightforward on the network.  Unfortunately, extortion and harassment become more insidious with  assurances of anonymity._____<3.3> How can anonymity be protected on the internet?  The chief means, as alluded to above, are masking identities in  email and posting. However, anonymous accounts (public accounts as  accessable and anonymous as e.g. public telephones) may be  effective as well, but this use is generally not officially  supported and even discouraged by some system adminstrators and NSF  guidelines.  The nonuniformity in the requirements of obtaining  accounts at different sites and institutions makes anonymous  accounts generally difficult to obtain to the public at large.  Many communications protocols are inherently detrimental to  anonymity.  Virtually every protocol in existence currently  contains information on both sender and receiver in every packet.  New communications protocols will likely develop that guarantee  much higher degrees of secure anonymous communication._____<3.4> What is `anonymous mail'?  One approach to `anonymizing' mail has been to set up an `anonymous  server' that, when activated by email to its address, responds by  allocating and supplying an `anonymous ID' that is unique to the  person requesting it (based on his email address).  This will vary  for the same person for different machine address email  originations. To send anonymous mail, the user sends email directed  to the server containing the final destination. The server  `anonymizes' the message by stripping of identification information  and forwards the message, which appears to originate from the  anonymous server only from the corresponding anonymous user id.   This is the `interactive' use of anonymity or pseudonymity  mentioned above.  Another more `fringe' approach is to run a `cypherpunk' remailer  from a regular user account (no root system privileges are  required). These are currently being pioneered by  Eric Hughes and  Hal Finney <hal@alumni.caltech.edu>. The operator runs a process on  a machine that anonymizes mail sent to him with certain  characteristics that distinguish it from his regular incoming mail  (typically fields in the header). One has been implemented as a   PERL script running on UNIX.  Several of these are in existence  currently but sites and software currently are highly unstable;  they may be in operation outside of system administrator knowledge.  The remailers don't generally support anonymous return addresses.   Mail that is incorrectly addressed is received by the operator.   Generally the user of the remailer has to disavow any  responsibility for the messages forwarded through his system,  although actually may be held liable regardless.  These approaches have several serious disadvantages and weaknesses:    - The anonymous server approach requires maintaining a mapping of    anonymous ID's to real addresses that must be maintained    indefinitely.  One alternative is to allow `deallocation' of    aliases at the request of the user, but this has not been    implemented yet.  - Although an unlikely scenario, traffic to any of these sites could    conceivably be monitored from the `outside', necessitating the    use of cryptography for basic protection,.  - Local administrators can shut them down either out of caprice or    under pressure from local, network, or government agencies.    - Unscrupulous providers of the services can monitor the traffic    that goes through them.  - Most remailers currently keep logs that may be inspected.   - The cypherpunk approach tends to be highly unstable because these    operators are basically  network users who do not own the    equipment and are accountable  to their own system    administrators, who may be unaware of the use and unsympathetic    to the philosophy of anonymity when the operation is discovered,    regarding it as illicit use.   - In all cases, a high degree of trust is placed in the anonymous    server operator by the user.  Currently the most direct route to anonymity involves using SMTP  protocols to submit a message directly to a server with arbitrary  field information.  This practice, not uncommon to hackers, and the  approach used by remailers, is generally viewed with hostility by  most system administrators.  Information in the header routing data  and logs of network port connection information may be retained  that can be used to track the originating site.  In practice, this  is generally infeasible and rarely carried out.  Some  administrators on the network will contact local administrators to  request a message be tracked and its writer admonished or punished  more severely (such as revoking the account), all of this actually  happening occasionally but infrequently.  See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and   ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''._____<3.5> What is `anonymous posting'?  Anonymous servers have been established as well for anonymous Usenet  posting with all the associated caveats above (monitored traffic,  capricious or risky local circumstances, logging).  Make sure to  test the system at least once by e.g. anonymous posting to  misc.test (however some operators don't recommend this because many  sites `autorespond' to test messages, possibly causing the  anonymous server to allocate anonymous IDs for those machines).   See the ``responsibilties associated with anonymous posting''  before proceeding.  Another direct route involves using NNTP protocols to submit a  message directly to a newserver with arbitrary field information.  This practice, not uncommon to hackers, is also generally viewed  with hostility by most system administrators, and similar  consequences can ensue.  See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and   ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''._____<3.6> Why is anonymity (un)stable on the internet?  As noted, many factors compromise the anonymity currently available  to the general internet community, and these services should be  used with great caution.  To summarize, the technology is in its  infancy and current approaches are unrefined, unreliable, and not  completely trustworthy.  No standards have been established and  troubling situations of loss of anonymity and bugs in the software  are prevalent.  Here are some encountered and potential bugs:     - One  anonymous remailer reallocated already allocated anonymous    return addresses.   - Others passed signature information embedded in messages    unaltered.   - Address resolution problems resulting in anonymized mail bounced    to a remailer are common.  - Forgeries to the anonymous server itself are a problem,  possibly    allowing unauthorized users to potentially glean anon ID - email    address  mappings in the alias file.  This can be remedied with    the use of passwords.  - Infinite mail loops are possible with chaining remailers.    Source code is being distributed, tested, and refined for these  systems, but standards are progressing slowly and weakly.  The  field is not likely to improve considerably without  official  endorsement and action by network agencies.  The whole idea is  essentially still in its infancy and viewed with suspicion and  distrust by many on the internet, seen as illegitimate or favorable  to criminality.  The major objection to anonymity over regular  internet use  is the perceived lack of accountability to system  operators, i.e. invulnerability to account restrictions resulting  from outside complaints.  System adminstrators at some sites have  threatened to filter anonymous news postings generated by the  prominent servers from their redistribution flows.  This may only  have the effect of encouraging server operators to create less  characteristically detectable headers.  Probably the least  problematic approach, and the most traditional to Usenet, is for  individual users to deal with anonymous mail however they prefer,  e.g. ignoring it or filtering it with kill files.  _____<3.7> What is the future of anonymity on the internet?  New anonymous protocols effectively serve to significantly increase  safeguards of anonymity.  For example, the same mechanism that  routes email over multiple hosts, thereby threatening its privacy,  can also be used to guarantee it. In a scheme called `chaining' an  anonymous message is passed through multiple anonymous servers  before reaching a destination.  In this way generally multiple  links of the chain have to be `broken' for security to be  compromised. Re-encryption at each link makes this scenario even  more unlikely.  Even more significantly the anonymous remailers  could be spread over the internet globally so that local weaknesses  (such as corrupt governments or legal wiretapping within a nation)  would be more unlikely to sacrifice overall security by message  tracing. However, remailers run by corrupt operators are possible.    The future of anonymous services on the internet is, at this time,  highly uncertain and fraught with peril. While specific groups seem  to benefit significantly from anonymous posting capabilities, many  feel that unlimited newsgroup scope for anonymous posting is a  disruptive and dangerous idea and detracts from discussions in  `serious' groups.   The introduction of unlimited group anonymity  may have fundamental repercussions on Usenet conventions and  distribution mechanisms such as moderated and `alt' groups have had  in the past. For example, as part of new group creation, the  charter may specify whether `anonymous' posting is (un)welcome.   Nevertheless, the widespread introduction and use of anonymity may  be inevitable. Based on traffic statistics, anonymous services are  in huge demand. Pervasive and readily available anonymity could  carry significant and unforeseen social consequences.  However, if  its use is continued to be generally regarded as subversive it may  be confined to the underground.  The ramifications of widespread  introduction of anonymity to Usenet are still largely unknown. It  is unclear whether it will provoke signficant amounts of new  traffic or, instead of expansion, cause a shift where a greater  portion of existing traffic is anonymized.

The new cryptography scheme was announced today by the White House and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the technical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman acknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super-secret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the encryption technology around which the new initiative is built.According to NIST, the technical specifications and the Presidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To open the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today filed a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption plan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the Computer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to open the development of non-military computer security standards to public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation of such standards.CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in developing the so-called "digital signature standard" (DSS), a communications authentication technology that NIST proposed for government-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA lawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first time that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard.  NSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying the classification of records concerning its creation of the DSS.David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the administration's apparent commitment to the privacy of electronic communications, as reflected in today's official statement,  "a step in the right direction."  But he questioned the propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from public scrutiny.  "At a time when we are moving towards the development of a new information infrastructure, it is vital that standards designed to protect personal privacy be established openly and with full public participation.  It is not appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of secrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to play a leading role in the development process." CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer industry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of technology on society.   CPSR has 21 chapters in the U.S. and maintains offices in Palo Alto, California, Cambridge, Massachusetts and Washington, DC.

What modulation scheme do these Clipper boxes use?Is it possible to record the tones for use after the keys are obtained?I thought it was quite difficult to record a modem session at someintermediate point on the line. Maybe they have taken a crash coursein data comms and have a unit that demodulates the tones and stores thedigital stream for decryption later. This would still suffer from thesame problems as trying to record the tones as the demodulator would notbe at one end of the line. If calls can't be recorded for decryption laterit would be quite easy to foil the system by buying lots of Clipper units(these are supposed to be cheap mass market items) and using them in turn.How tolerant is the modulation scheme to errors? These things are proposedfor use by US corporations to secure their foreign offices, where phoneline quality may well be poor. It seems hard enough to me to get digitisedspeech of any quality into something a modem can handle without having toadd lots of error correction to keep the decryption in sync.>Q:   Will the devices be exportable?

I'll present my variant on it instead, since I feel it's abit stronger against some likely attempts to cheat.  depends on theprotocol that's followed for reading traffic.  Briefly, the cops get awiretap warrant, and record the call.  They then notice the encryptionand the disclosure header.  It, along with a copy of their warrant, issent to the FBI, or whoever it is who holds the family key.  TheF-holder decrypts the header, and sends the serial number N and theencrypted session key U[K] to the escrow agents.  They, in turn, use U1and U2 to recover K, and send that to the local police.Note how this solves the problem of wiretapping forever.  Neither thecops nor the FBI ever see U, so they can't read other traffic.  Everyrequest must be validated by both the FBI and the escrow agents.  Thecops and the FBI together can't cheat, since they don't have U.  (Iregard that as a likely pairing of folks who might try to beat thesystem.  It's to prevent this that I modified Alvarez's scheme.)  Theescrow agents can't read the conversation, since they don't have it;all they have is N and U[K].  And the police don't even see N.It's harder to see how to block decryption of old, warrantless,wiretaps.  There is one protection -- you have to persuade the escrowagents that the call is current.  But that's not nearly as strong.There are approaches I can see that might work, involving sequences ofdata on an unalterable medium, complete with cryptographic protectionagainst insertion onto a new medium.  But I don't have anything yetthat isn't too complex for comfort, or too hard to install in the realworld.  The NSA might have an answer; they may or may not be smarterthan me, but I've been working on this for a week, and they've had years.

If you can't provide an answer, change theassumptions to something you can deal with.It's not a matter of the government listening on on everything, it's amatter of the government listening on anyone they take an interest in.Say, if you do something heinous like attend a computer meeting at amall, the Secret Service decides to go for a warrantless search, andacquires your name.  It's a matter of any number of possible wiretapabuses that cryptology makes far less likely, and this chip cansabotage. Par for the course, though.  I predicted that you'd be jumping in infavor of this.  The reply was that you'd justify anything up to andincluding death camps as long as the government backed them and had awritten policy statement.

I don't work for, nor am I a member of EFF, ACLU, or any similarorganizations, but I do agree with them on a great many things. --Aristophanes----------                     AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION                       WASHINGTON OFFICE                                                                                                                           122 Maryland Avenue, NE November 1, 1985                                   Washington, DC 20002                                                    --------------------                                                    National HeadquartersMr. David Chaum                                     132 West 43rd Street    Centre for Mathematics and Computer Science         New York.

Asociety of  individuals  and  organizations  that  would  expend  thetime and resources to use a  series  of  'digital  pseudonyms' toavoid data linkage does not in my opinion make big brotherobsolete but  acts  on  the  assumption  that  big  brother  is  everpresent.  I  view  your  system  as  a  form  of  societal  paranoia.As a matter of  principle,  we  are  working  to  enact  formallegal protections for  individual  privacy  rather  than  relying  ontechnical solutions.   We want to  assume  a  society  of  law  whichrespects legal limits rather than  a  society  that  will  disobey  thelaw, requiring  citizens  to  depend  on  technical  solutions.  e.g.require  a  judical  warrant  for  government  interception  of  datacommunications rather than  encrypt  all  messages  on  the  assumptionthat regardless of the lawt  the  government  will  abuse  its  powerand invade privacy.As a  matter  of  practicality,  I  do  not  think  your  systemoffers much hope for privacy.    First, the trend toward universalidentifiers  is  as  much.-a  movement  generated  by  government  orindustry's desire to keep track of all citizens as it is bycitizens seeking simplicity and convenience in all transactions.At best,  your  system  would  benefit  the  sophisticated  and  mostwould opt for  simplicity.  The  poor  and  the  undereducated  wouldnever use or benefit from it.Finally where there's a  will, there's  a  way. If  governmentwants to link data bases, it  will,  by  law, require  the  disclosureof various individual pseudonyms used by citizens or prohibit itfor data bases which the government wants to link.      Sincecorporations  make  money  by  trading  commercial  lists  with   oneanother, they will never adopt  the  system  or  if  it  is  adopted,will use "fine printn  contracts  to  permit  selling  various   codesused by their customers to other firms.The solution remains law, policy, and consensus about limitson government or corporate intrusion into areas of individualautonomy.  Technique can be used to enforce that consensus or tooverride it. It cannot be used as a substitute for suchconsensus.                                            Sincerely Yours,                                             /Sig/                                            Jerry J.

The parts aremostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers every 21 days.Contents:* What is public-key cryptography?* What's RSA?* Is RSA secure?* How fast can people factor numbers?* What about other public-key cryptosystems?* What is public-key cryptography?  In a classic cryptosystem, we have encryption functions E_K and  decryption functions D_K such that D_K(E_K(P)) = P for any plaintext  P. In a public-key cryptosystem, E_K can be easily computed from some  ``public key'' X which in turn is computed from K. X is published, so  that anyone can encrypt messages. If D_K cannot be easily computed  from X, then only the person who generated K can decrypt messages.  That's the essence of public-key cryptography, published by Diffie  and Hellman in 1976.  In a classic cryptosystem, if you want your friends to be able to  send secret messages to you, you have to make sure nobody other than  them sees the key K. In a public-key cryptosystem, you just publish X,  and you don't have to worry about spies.  This is only the beginning of public-key cryptography. There is an  extensive literature on security models for public-key cryptography,  applications of public-key cryptography, other applications of the  mathematical technology behind public-key cryptography, and so on.* What's RSA?  RSA is a public-key cryptosystem defined by Rivest, Shamir, and  Adleman.  For full details, there is a FAQ available by ftp at  RSA.COM. Here's a small example.  Plaintexts are positive integers up to 2^{512}. Keys are quadruples  (p,q,e,d), with p a 256-bit prime number, q a 258-bit prime number,  and d and e large numbers with (de - 1) divisible by (p-1)(q-1). We  define E_K(P) = P^e mod pq, D_K(C) = C^d mod pq.  Now E_K is easily computed from the pair (pq,e)---but, as far as  anyone knows, there is no easy way to compute D_K from the pair  (pq,e). So whoever generates K can publish (pq,e). Anyone can send a  secret message to him; he is the only one who can read the messages.* Is RSA secure?  Nobody knows. An obvious attack on RSA is to factor pq into p and q.  See below for comments on how fast state-of-the-art factorization  algorithms run. Unfortunately nobody has the slightest idea how to  prove that factorization---or any realistic problem at all, for that  matter---is inherently slow. It is easy to formalize what we mean by  ``RSA is/isn't strong''; but, as Hendrik W. Lenstra, Jr., says,  ``Exact definitions appear to be necessary only when one wishes to  prove that algorithms with certain properties do _not_ exist, and  theoretical computer science is notoriously lacking in such negative  results.''* How fast can people factor numbers?  It depends on the size of the numbers. In October 1992 Arjen Lenstra  and Dan Bernstein factored 2^523 - 1 into primes, using about three  weeks of MasPar time. (The MasPar is a 16384-processor SIMD machine;  each processor can add about 200000 integers per second.) The  algorithm there is called the ``number field sieve''; it is quite a  bit faster for special numbers like 2^523 - 1 than for general numbers  n, but it takes time only about exp(O(log^{1/3} n log^{2/3} log n)) in  any case.  An older and more popular method for smaller numbers is the ``multiple  polynomial quadratic sieve'', which takes time exp(O(log^{1/2} n  log^{1/2} log n))---faster than the number field sieve for small n,  but slower for large n. The breakeven point is somewhere between 100  and 150 digits, depending on the implementations.  Factorization is a fast-moving field---the state of the art just a few  years ago was nowhere near as good as it is now. If no new methods are  developed, then 2048-bit RSA keys will always be safe from  factorization, but one can't predict the future. (Before the number  field sieve was found, many people conjectured that the quadratic  sieve was asymptotically as fast as any factoring method could be.)* What about other public-key cryptosystems?  We've talked about RSA because it's well known and easy to describe.  But there are lots of other public-key systems around, many of which  are faster than RSA or depend on problems more widely believed to be  difficult. This has been just a brief introduction; if you really want  to learn about the many facets of public-key cryptography, consult the  books and journal articles listed in part 10.

If the public key is only 80 or 160 bits long,does anyone know of any public-key schemes that are secure with that keysize?  (Diffie-Hellman or maybe El Gamal, with p set to a constant value?)   Presumably, the real scheme is something like:    1.  Exchange/verify public keys.   2.  Send encrypted (randomly-generated) session key.   3.  Encrypt / Decrypt voice trafic with some sort of fast stream cipher.    Can anyone elaborate on this, or show me what I'm missing here?    --John Kelsey, c445585@mizzou1.missouri.edu

Includes +, -, *, /, exponentiation, mod, primality testing,    sqrt, random number generator, and a few others.  The package    was uncommented and undocumented; I have tried to add enough    comments to get by.  This is the only of these packages that I    have actually used.  It works well and is very portable.      I haven't done any benchmarks against the others, but the code     looks clever & Lenstra is an accomplished number theorist.    Unlike the other packages here, this one requires you to allocate    storage statically--only a problem if your numbers are really huge.    Arjen has placed the code in the public domain.      Filename:  lenstra.tar.Zlenstra_3.1    Arjen Lenstra,  Bellcore    An improved version of Arjen's package above.  This one    does signed arithmetic and dynamic allocation (which can be turned    off as an option). Has a few new routines, too.

I mention it here because those who have heard    of SPX have probably correctly guessed that it contains a large    integer package and I want to inform you that the large integer    package it contains is indeed DEC's BigNum from France.    You can get a beta test copy of SPX from crl.dec.com (192.58.206.2).     Use it only for testing, as it "may" expire on a certain date.

I understand, believe it or not, and there are any number of kinds of conversation and communication I engage in that I wouldn't even consider using this scheme for.  On the other hand, I don't see "Clipper" as providing a secure channel--it just prevents casual eavesdropping.  This is part of why I am not worried about it per se.  Trying to look at Clipper as a serious security tool is simply ludicrous.  It's a voice scrambler, nothing more.There is still plenty of market for real crypto.> As for "its better than the status quo", well, first of all, you can > get a cryptophone from companies like Cylink today -- and they work > well.They cost an arm and a leg, though.

This is old news.  I can do this now.> There ARE no crypto restrictions... yet. You can use anything you want > RIGHT NOW. The point is to maintain that right. There ARE restrictions.  Example: We're a networking software vendor with a large overseas share of our market.  We cannot currently ship PEM, or even simple DES, in our products without case-by-case approval from the Department of State.  ITAR presents a material trade barrier to US firms trying to compete in international information systems markets.Sure, you can use whatever freebie software you want to talk over BBS's in the USA.  I, on the other hand, want strong crypto (PKCS, for example) to be the *default* for electronic mail, worldwide.  I want priests to be able to hear confession over email.  I want lawyers to be able to talk to clients in confidence over email, or doctors talk with patients.  I want to be able to order products from my favorite Japanese mail-order catalog over the net.  I want to be able to sign contracts, transact business, and so on electronically.This is so far infeasible as a result of the current restrictions on crytographic systems, especially beyond the borders of the USA.Clipper is irrelevant, and if it distracts the authorities into feeling safe, all the better.  Its only danger is if it emboldens them into trying to put more restrictions into place, on the theory that it is "good enough for anyone who has nothing to hide."  That argument is, of course, utter BS, just as much as "no one needs an assault rifle".Amanda WalkerInterCon Systems Corporation

The algorithm uses 32 rounds of scramblingcompared with 16 in DES.In addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his or her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key plain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be K is the session key shared by the sender and receiver.  Any method(e.g., public key) can be used to establish the session key.  In theAT&T telephone security devices, which will have the new chip, the keyis negotiated using a public-key protocol. encrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK, and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK producing     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the"family key") and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held bylaw enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?  Iwill also check it out, but this is 7am Sunday so I did not want to wait.        The unit key will be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 and K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow The unit key, also called the "chip key," is generated from theserial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocksderived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.Compute the 64-bit block         R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] (Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode withtwo keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3.(I'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact thatthey're called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 areconcatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 andthe next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.authorities. Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be decided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that they will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased. Marty is right on this and the FBI has asked me for suggestions.Please pass them to me along with your reasons.  In addition to Marty'scriteria, I would add that the agencies must have an established recordof being able to safeguard highly sensitive information.  Some suggestionsI've received so far include SRI, Rand, Mitre, the national labs (Sandia,LANL, Los Alamos), Treasury, GAO.When a court order obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law enforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information flowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that they may do this constantly on all links, with or without a court order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links over which a message will flow.] My understanding is that there will be only one decode box and that itwill be operated by the FBI.  The service provider will isolate thecommunications stream and pass it to the FBI where it will pass throughthe decode box, which will have been keyed with K.for "the wiretap authorizations." When Levy asked forthe details so he could review the cases as required bylaw, the agent told him that his predecessors just turnedover 40-50 blank, signed forms every time. Levi did not        comply and changed the system, but the lesson is clear:         No single person or authority should have the power to        authorize wiretapsNo single person does, at least for FBI taps.  After completing a moundof paperwork, an agent must get the approval of several people on a chainthat includes FBI legal counsel before the request is even taken to theAttorney General for final approval.Dorothy Denning

Seems to me that encryption ought tobe covered by the first amendment.   Using this line of reasoning, thegovernment shouldn't be able to restrict what data people encrypt andwhat encryption algorithms they use because this would be restrictingone's freedom of speech.  In other words, encrypted data---text,graphics, or other information---is just another form of free speech.For this reason the government shouldn't be able to regulate the useof encryption algorithms and encrypted data.  The only time thegovernment should be able to 'force' someone to reveal his or herencryption keys for some encrypted data is when the encrypted datain question may be something that isn't protected by the firstamendment such as kiddy porn.  Even in a case like this thegovernment should be required to get a search warrant before coercingsomeone into revealing the keys.BTW, what encryption methods are considered to be state-of-the-artnowdays.

Rather than use technology to accommodatethe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy andlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government againstindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years toprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used toprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryptiontechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and theunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be usedby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the "Clipper Chip" hasbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents anew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached toan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communicationsusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many incommercial use today.This new technology will help companies protect proprietaryinformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversationsand prevent unauthorized release of data transmittedelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves theability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies tointercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. A "key-escrow" system will be established to ensure that the"Clipper Chip" is used to protect the privacy of law-abidingAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                2"keys," numbers that will be needed by authorized governmentagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When thedevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separatelyin two "key-escrow" data bases that will be established by theAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited togovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct awiretap.The "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with nonew authorities to access the content of the privateconversations of Americans.To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, theAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the newdevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside thegovernment will be offered access to the confidential details ofthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly reporttheir findings.The chip is an important step in addressing the problem ofencryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect theprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shieldcriminals and terrorists.  We need the "Clipper Chip" and otherapproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with accessto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using itto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technologytrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),the President has directed government agencies to develop acomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone          calls and data, under proper court or other legal          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern          technology to build the National Information          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and          the competitiveness of American industry in the global          marketplace; and      --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export          high technology products.The President has directed early and frequent consultations withaffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate theprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                3The Administration is committed to working with the privatesector to spur the development of a National InformationInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computertechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access toinformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks("information superhighways") will transmit video, images, HDTVprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephonesystem transmits voice.Since encryption technology will play an increasingly importantrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must actquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regardingits use.  The Administration is committed to policies thatprotect all Americans' right to privacy while also protectingthem from those who break the law.Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the newencryption technology are also available.

What would they have to do to     decipher the message?A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They     would then present documentation of this authorization to     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key     escrow system.Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will     oversee the key-escrow data banks.Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure     how strong the security is?  A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all     potential users that there are no unrecognized     vulnerabilities.Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet     officials.Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the     decisions related to this initiative.Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?A:   The government designed and developed the key access     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip     manufacturer that produces them.Q:   Who provides the "Clipper Chip"?A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed     to other vendors in the future.Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating     the "Clipper Chip" into their devices.     Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more     powerful encryption devices?A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive     than others readily available today, but it is just one     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to     encryption technology, which the Administration is     developing.     The Administration is not saying, "since encryption     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,     we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries have     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that "every     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an     unbreakable commercial encryption product."  There is a     false "tension" created in the assessment that this issue is     an "either-or" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,     balanced approach such as is proposed with the "Clipper     Chip" and similar encryption techniques.Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from     that of the Bush Administration?  A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption     technology in telecommunications and computing and are     committed to working with industry and public-interest     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime     and terrorism.Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use     the government hardware?A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability     of these products.----------- End included article ----------- -- pat@rwing.uucp      [Without prejudice UCC 1-207]     (Pat Myrto) Seattle, WA         If all else fails, try:       ...!uunet!pilchuck!rwing!patWISDOM: "Only two things are infinite; the universe and human stupidity,         and I am not sure about the former."              - Albert Einstien

So the  proposed wiretap chip must raise phone costs by less than one part   in three thousand to be cost-effective. BACKGROUNDUntil now, phones have happened to allow the existence of "wiretaps",detectors which could pick up conversations on a phone line.  And overtime, law enforcement agencies have come to rely on this capability toaid in criminal investigations.  However, powerful new encryptiontechnologies threaten this status quo, by making possible trulyprivate communication.  A small chip in each phone could soon make itliterally impossible to overhear a conversation without physicalmicrophones at either end.In order to preserve the ability of law enforcement agencies to tapphone conversations, the U.S. government announced on April 16, 1993that it had developed and begun manufacturing a special "wiretap" chipto be placed in future phones, instead of the total privacy chipswhich have been under private development.  The same day, AT&Tannounced it would use these chips "in all its secure telephoneproducts".Each chip would be created under government supervision, when it wouldbe given a fixed indentifier and encryption key.  Periodically duringeach conversation, the chip would broadcast its identifier and otherinfo in a special "law enforcement block".  Law enforcement officerswith a court order could then obtain the key corresponding to theindentifier from special trust agencies, and could thereby listen inon any future or previously recorded conversations on that phone.To date, most concerns voiced about this plan have been about itssecurity.  The government won't disclose the encryption algorithm, andmany suspect the government will not limit its access in the way ithas claimed.  The track record of previous governments does notinspire confidence on this point [1].However, this paper will neglect these concerns, and ask insteadwhether this new wiretap chip is a cost-effective tool for policeinvestigation.  That is, which is a cheaper way for society toinvestigate crime: force phone communications to support wiretaps, orgive police agencies more money to investigate crimes in other ways?Or to put it another way, would police agencies be willing to pay foreach wiretap, if they had to pay their share of the full social costof forcing phones to support wiretaps?To start to answer this question, we might compare the currentbenefits wiretaps provide to law enforcement agencies with projectedcosts of implementing the new wiretap chip plan.  And since currentbenefits are easier to estimate, we begin there.WIRETAP BENEFITS1990 is the latest year for which wiretap statistics are available[2].  In that year, 872 wiretap installations were requested, and norequests were denied.  (This figure does not include wiretaps obtainedwith the consent of a party to the conversation.)  2057 arrestsresulted from wiretaps started the same year, 1486 arrests came fromwiretaps in previous years, and 55% of arrests led to convictions.76% of the wiretaps were for phones (vs pagers, email, etc.), 60% wereregarding drug offenses, and 40% were requested by federalauthorities.  Each wiretap installation heard an average of 1487calls, 22% of them incriminating, among 131 people, and cost anaverage of $45,125 (extrapolating from the 794 installationsreporting costs), mostly for labor.Thus a total of about $40 Million was spent on wiretaps, to obtainabout 4000 arrests, at $10,000 per arrest.  Thus these arrests are atleast four times more expensive than the $2500 per arrest figure onegets by dividing the $28 Billion spent by all police nationally by thetotal 11 Million non-traffic arrests [3].  Thus the $30 Million peryear spent on phone taps is only one thousanth of the total policeexpenditures.  And if we divide this by the 138 Million phone "access"lines in the country [3], we get about 23 cents spent per year perphone line, or about two cents a month.In general, we deter a given class of criminals through a combinationof a perceived probability of being caught and convicted, and someexpected punishment level if convicted.  So the social value of havingwiretaps is no more than the amount that we would have to pay to getthe same criminal deterrence through other means.  If unable towiretap a particular suspect's phone, police might instead use hiddenmicrophones, or investigate that suspect in other ways.  Or policemight focus on suspects more easily investigated without wiretaps.  Orwe might raise the fine or prison time for certain types of crime.If we generously assume that these substitutes for wiretaps would beon average twice as expensive as wiretaps, then the annual socialbenefit of phone wiretaps is about equal to the current spending levelof two cents a month per phone line.WIRETAP COSTSLet us for the moment optimistically assume that the US governmentencryption scheme is as secure as whatever private enterprise wouldhave offered instead, protecting our conversations from the spyingears of neighbors, corporations, and governments, both foreign anddomestic.  Even so, the need to support wiretaps would add manyadditional costs to build and maintain our communication system.Extra law enforcement blocks would be added to phone transmissions,increasing traffic by some unknown percentage.  A special process mustbe used to add encryption keys to chips, while securely distributingthese keys to special agencies, which must be funded and monitored.The chips themselves are designed by a military contractor, whosedesign is to remain secret, and are manufactured through a specialprocess so that the chip becomes nearly impossible to take apart.(Chips are now offered at the relatively high price of $30 a peice inlots of 10,000 [4].)  Private encryption systems not supportingwiretaps would require none of these extra costs.Perhaps most important, government degree would at least partiallyreplace private marketplace evolution of standards for how voice is tobe represented, encrypted, and exchanged in our future phones.  It iswidely believed that governments are less efficient than privateenterprise in procuring products and standards, though they may perhapsperform a useful brokering role when we choose between competing privatestandards.  How much less efficient is a matter of debate, some saythey pay twice as much, while others might say only 10% more.    Currently, a total of $96 Billion is spent as operating expenses ofU.S. phone companies [3], which comes out to about $60 per month peraccess line.  If we compare this to the wiretap value of two cents permonth, we see that if wiretaps raise average operating costs by evenas much as one part in 3000, then wiretaps are not cost effective!And this doesn't even include extra costs phone owners pay becausetheir encryption chips are more expensive.  Of course most phoneswouldn't have encryption chips for a while, but the wiretap benefitper phone is still the same, so this argument still applies.CONCLUSIONGiven this dramatic difference between the total cost of running thephone system and the value of wiretaps, we can justify only theslightest modification of the phone system to accommodate wiretaps.When the only modification required was to allow investigators in toattach clips to phone wires, wiretap support may have been reasonable.But when we consider substantial modification, the burden of proof isclearly on those proposing such modification to show that the costswould really be less than the benefits.  If consensus cannot be obtain on this cost/benefit estimate, acompromise might be to tax phones which do not support wiretaps at arate of say five cents per month, a tax payable to police agenciesnationwide to compensate them for their loss of wiretap abilities.[1] The Invisible Weapon, Oxford Press, ISBN 0-19-506273-6[2] Report on Applications for Orders Authorizing or Approving the    Interception of Wire, Oral, or Electronic Communications, 1990,    Administrative Office of U.S. Courts, Washington, DC 20544.[3] U.S. Statistical Abstracts, 1992.

But thisstrategy wouldn't get the stuff admitted in court.  (At least, notin the near term.)In other words, near as I can tell, the thing that makes such evidenceinadmissable is the interception without a warrant, not the attempt tointerpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  I'd be surprisedthat archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anythingbut analogous to a wiretap by the courts.Note that that doesn't mean I think it won't be done if technicallyfeasible.  Just as I'm sure many wiretaps are done now withoutwarrants, just to fish for avenues to investigate.  So in the future,start surveilance, start archiving data, trump up some probable cause,decrypt post-facto after the warrant is in hand, and the investigationgets a boost from data that, sadly, won't ever be presented to a jury.While I'm posting...  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting thisarchiving scenario to extremes, read "Lacey and his Friends", acollection of sf stories by David Drake.  The US starts down theslippery slope by archiving *everyghing*.  But don't worry folks, it'sstored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants canget to it.  And by the way, we'll be installing cameras on all majorstreets.  Hey, this is nothing new, we already have cameras in banks andteller machines, don't we?And then we'll pass laws requiring cameras covering *all* publicplaces.  Then in some private places.  Then we'll make it a crime everto be out of range of a camera, except in legally licensed privacycubicles.  Only alone.  And with a thorough body search before andafter.  But, see, there's still a right to privacy.  We haven'tcurtailed any rights, not really.  And just think how much easier it'dbe to solve crimes in such a situation: just obtain a warrant, put on aVR helmet and take a walk down memory lane.And hey, nobody'll be tracking *you* or *me*, no need to be self-conscious.After all, if you're not doing anything illegal...Funny, though.  While speeding and the radar detector industry becamepretty much a thing of the past, somehow all this didn't elminate allcrime in the story.  And somehow, politicians got exemptions on groundsof national security, and rich corporations got exemptions for theirexecs on grounds of industrial espionage and the preservation ofcompetition.  And not everybody was exactly happy with the system.  I can't imagine why.--Wayne Throop   throopw%sheol@concert.net               throop%aurgate@concert.net

Please feel free to distribute this and my other messageson Clipper.The name of the encryption algorithm is "Skipjack."Martin Hellman had written                and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part                message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK                producing                     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}To which I responded:        My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the        "family key") and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by        law enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?I was correct in that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK.  However, Skipjackbeing a single-key system, there is, of course, not a separate decrypt keyfor the family key SK.        The unit key, also called the "chip key," is generated from the        serial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks        derived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.        Compute the 64-bit block                R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1]        (Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with        two keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3.        (I'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that        they're called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are        concatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and        the next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.The seeds S1 and S2 do not change.   The whole process is performed ona laptop computer, and S1 and S2 are supplied by two independent peopleso that no one person knows both.  The same S1 and S2 are used duringan entire "programming session" to generate keys for a stream of serialnumbers.  Everything is discarded at the end (the computer could bethrown out if desired).The serial number is 30 bits and the values N1, N2, and N3 are formedby padding the serial number with fixed 34-bit blocks (separate paddingfor each value).The resulting keys K1 and K2 are output onto separate floppy disks, pairedup with their serial number.  Each pair is stored in a separate file.  Thefloppy disks are taken away by two separate people on behalf of the twoescrow agencies.Dorothy Denningdenning@cs.georgetown.edu--------------------------------------------------------I am sure more technical detail will be known when time goes by.Please remark, that in posting this, I do not automatically agreewith it's contents and implications. So don't swamp my mailbox :-)I just think this is an valuable addition to the less than technicaldiscussion that is rising here. And, no, I don't mind if you callS1 and S2 'backdoor', as I could imagine the key-generation processworking without these seeds and the dependency of K1,K2 from theSerial-Number.Friendly greetings,Germano Caronni-- Instruments register only through things they're designed to register.Space still contains infinite unknowns.

After reading the text some distinct questionsarised to me, which I guess will also be asked by other people. Perhapswould it be interesting to find an answer to these questions ?>                      THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY>    N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)shorter or longer ?> Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to> encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The> telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two> values:>    E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and>    E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field ,> which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement> field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U> concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family> key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after> an authorized wiretap has been installed.First question: When will the LawEnforcmentField be transmitted, and howdoes the remote Clipper Chip handle it? Is it transmitted periodicallyin the stream of encrypted blocks, or just at the beginning ? Does thephone at the other side discard those packets via a protocol whatsoever,or tries it to turn them into voice-output ? (Which would not be disturbing)> At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key> escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret, random> 80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random> 80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unit> keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are a> function of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.Second question: Why!?!? Why is such a strange procedure used, and nota real RNG ? This turns those S1,S2 in a kind of bottleneck for system-security.> When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they> will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get> access to the communications line.

The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the> family key F, giving E[K; U] + N.

All this will> be accomplished through a special black box decoder.So no (technical) provision will be taken to place a 'timeout' on thesewarrants? This would be a unique possibility to realize such a technicalrestriction, by letting the escrow-agencies perform the decoding of thesession key. Just take modem-lines instead of secure fax.

Pass a law stating that if, within ayear of performaing a wiretap on someone, a police agency hasn'tmanaged to convict the suspect of the crime the warrant/wiretap was for,then that agency owes the suspect $1 million to repay him/her forlost privacy.   Of course, there are *still* problems with the technical aspects ofClipper, and with the one-size-fits-all mentality that would be behindan attempt to enforce it as a standard.  But this would be a way forthose in favor of allowing continued wiretaps to assure us that it willonly be used in cases where the crime is important and the police areall but certain that there really will be a conviction....    --John KJ            elsey

The team which was later to prosecute him oncriminal charges had to sequester itself from all reports of ON'simmunized testimony. ON's lawyer brought up the probability that atleast someone on the team had heard about the Senate testimony, and itwas a strong factor against the prosecution, which is one of thereasons this ON is still walking around free today.Peter Treiptrei@mitre.org

The willingness of the majority of the people to give up their freedom in exchange for a sense of safety is hardly limited to the USA, and is an endemic problem in any human society of any appreciable size.  The structure of the US government does try to combat this tendency to some extent, but fighting entropy is always a losing battle.  Most people would rather have comfort than freedom.  The paradox is that you can't really have the former, in the long term, unless you have the latter.One of the reasons that I probably come across to some people as a weird cross between a libertarian and an "establishment tool" is that I end up taking an utterly pragmatic view of government.  I don't get up in arms when the government fails to protect the interests of the people, because in my lifetime it never has--therefore, I have no expectation that it will.  As a result, I protect my own interests rather than expecting the government to be "fair".  I will use strong cryptography when I think it is needed, whether or not it is legal at the time.  Same thing with anything else the government would rather not see in private hands--that's their problem.  What's important to me is using the right tool for the job.  If it's legal, so much the better.  If it is not, but does not violate my (very strong) sense of personal ethics, I will use it anyway as long I think it is worth it.  Expecting the government to actually protect the interests of its citizens, except by accident, is utter folly.  Even Jefferson, one of the major architects of the American system of government, figured that in a couple hundred years it would become so corrupt and self-serving that it would be time dismantle it and try again, by revolution if necessary.  I agree, and while I don't go around trying to spark one, I'll certainly participate if it happens when I'm around.  There is a reason I am such a strong supporter of individual rights while being so cynical about politics.  I've already written off politics.And yes, this may get me in trouble some day.  If so, so be it.  I drive faster than 55 MPH, too.Amanda WalkerInterCon Systems Corporation

Knowing that WE have let our law enforcement agenciesseize our property against the Fifth Amendment of OUR Constitution tells me thatwe are absolving ourselves of our responsibility for SELF-GOVERNANCE.  WE haveto take our government back from the self-serving politicians who create lawsand rules only to better their positions within the government.  WE have allowedthem to take too much power from the people of this nation.  That situation hasto be changed.Allowing the law enforcement agencies to use the seized property to pay-off druginformants who lie and continue to deal in drugs is tantamount to making a pactwith the Devil himself.  It's a vicious cycle.  The law enforcement agencies aremotivated to seize property to fund their own activities.  And having no easyway for the citizen to regain the property intact once taken gives even moreincentive for the agencies to take property.It's also interesting to note that two months ago Rush Limbaugh said thatClinton would have the "plumbers" out in force shortly.  Clinton and hishenchmen firmly believe in strong ubiquitous government control.  Anytime aleader believes in that, the leader will use every means possible to retain thatcontrol and take more.WE have to take OUR government back.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to   accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure   telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.   For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our   private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the   tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of   protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate   the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and   law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against   industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.   Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to   protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to   protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption   technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the   unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used   by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.   A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the "Clipper Chip" has   been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a   new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,   relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to   an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications   using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in   commercial use today.   This new technology will help companies protect proprietary   information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations   and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted   electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the   ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to   intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.    A "key-escrow" system will be established to ensure that the   "Clipper Chip" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding   Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique   2   "keys," numbers that will be needed by authorized government   agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the   device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately   in two "key-escrow" data bases that will be established by the   Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to   government officials with legal authorization to conduct a   wiretap.   The "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with no   new authorities to access the content of the private   conversations of Americans.   To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the   Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new   devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the   government will be offered access to the confidential details of   the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report   their findings.   The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of   encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the   privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield   criminals and terrorists.  We need the "Clipper Chip" and other   approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access   to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it   to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology   trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),   the President has directed government agencies to develop a   comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:--   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to     employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;--   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone     calls and data, under proper court or other legal     order, when necessary to protect our citizens;--   the effective and timely use of the most modern     technology to build the National Information     Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and     the competitiveness of American industry in the global     marketplace; and --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export     high technology products.   The President has directed early and frequent consultations with   affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the   privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.   3   The Administration is committed to working with the private   sector to spur the development of a National Information   Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer   technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to   information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks   ("information superhighways") will transmit video, images, HDTV   programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone   system transmits voice.   Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important   role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act   quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding   its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that   protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting   them from those who break the law.   Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.    The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new   encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement withno new authorities to access the content of the privateconversations of Americans.   Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap ona drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversationencrypted using the device.  What would they have to do todecipher the message?   A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally acourt order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  Theywould then present documentation of this authorization tothe two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys andobtain the keys for the device being used by the drugsmugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which arestored separately in order to ensure the security of the keyescrow system.   Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?   A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independententities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and theAdministration have yet to determine which agencies willoversee the key-escrow data banks.   Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be surehow strong the security is?     A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryptionsystems readily available today.  While the algorithm willremain classified to protect the security of the key escrowsystem, we are willing to invite an independent panel ofcryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure allpotential users that there are no unrecognizedvulnerabilities.   Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?   A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, theCommerce Department, and other key agencies were involved inthis decision.  This approach has been endorsed by thePresident, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinetofficials.   Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?   A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry onencryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensifyas we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We havebriefed members of Congress and industry leaders on thedecisions related to this initiative.   Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?   A:   The government designed and developed the key accessencryption microcircuits, but it is not providing themicrocircuits to product manufacturers.  Productmanufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chipmanufacturer that produces them.   Q:   Who provides the "Clipper Chip"?   A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,California, and will sell the chip to encryption devicemanufacturers.  The programming function could be licensedto other vendors in the future.   Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?    A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporatingthe "Clipper Chip" into their devices.   Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technologicalsolution like the one proposed, would the Administration bewilling to use legal remedies to restrict access to morepowerful encryption devices?   A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will beconsidered during the broad policy review.  The key escrowmechanism will provide Americans with an encryption productthat is more secure, more convenient, and less expensivethan others readily available today, but it is just onepiece of what must be the comprehensive approach toencryption technology, which the Administration isdeveloping.The Administration is not saying, "since encryptionthreatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries haveeffectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that "everyAmerican, as a matter of right, is entitled to anunbreakable commercial encryption product."  There is afalse "tension" created in the assessment that this issue isan "either-or" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,balanced approach such as is proposed with the "ClipperChip" and similar encryption techniques.   Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the ClintonAdministration's policy toward encryption will differ fromthat of the Bush Administration?     A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryptiontechnology in telecommunications and computing and arecommitted to working with industry and public-interestgroups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that lawenforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crimeand terrorism.   Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that usethe government hardware?   A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export controlrequirements.  Case-by-case review for each export isrequired to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  Thesame is true for other encryption devices.  One of theattractions of this technology is the protection it can giveto U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With thisin mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on acase-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use thesedevices to secure their own communications abroad.  We planto review the possibility of permitting wider exportabilityof these products.

Given:1. the purpose of the one-time pad is to give unbreakable security,and the expense of key distribution etc., imply that the clientsreally do want that level of security2. These same people want to keep P a secretI find it hard to believe that Eve might happen to have a copy of Plying around.(I am aware that the same argument applies to Eve knowing even a smallpart of the message, but Eve must know EXACTLY where (which bytes) inC her known susequence starts, or the result will be garbled. I findthis at least as surprising.)Back to the question:If I had the resources to use a one-time-pad for such transmissions, Iwould also append a Message Authentication Code to the message, using upthe next bits of the one-time-pad as the key perhaps. Your originalquestion basically asked whether there was any way to authenticate themessage with the same degree of security as the Pad itself provided,and I don't know the answer. However, I would propose the followingfor discussion.Alice and Bob have an arbitrary number of secret, random bits toshare, which Eve doesn't know. She finds them out (effectively) byknowing some P and the corresponding C. It is the fact that theyCORRESPOND that causes the problem. If a message authentication code was tobe created using some one-time-pad operation such that Eve could notknow which parts of the MAC were affected by which parts of the input,she would be unable to forge a MAC to correspond.What is required is a non-linear combiner of parts of the message.(Non-linear so that simply xoring or subtracting or whatever doesn'thave exactly the same effect).Now, at the end of the encrypted message C, Alice appends a n-bit MACcomputed as follows (S2 means the next full chunk of the one time pad):  1. compute C2 = P xor S2, and pad to an n-bit boundary with more of S  2. break C2 into n-bit chunks  3. set MAC to 0 (initialisation vector)  4. for i in each chunk sequentially       set MAC = MAC NLOP C2[i]At the end of this process MAC is the Message Authentication Code.(Bob verifies the MAC in the obvious manner; he recovers theplaintext P, then uses some more of his pad to reproduce the MAC inthe same manner.)NLOP is the non-linear operator, and there is the rub. The simplestnon-linear operator I can think of is an S-box; that is, have a fixed(even published) permutation of the n-bit integers, an indexable tablecalled Sbox, and use:  x NLOP y = x xor Sbox[y].Practically speaking, I think this solves your problem, as Eve neversees the intermediate output C2, and hence can't deduce S2 or perform any validsubstitution on it.Also practically speaking, you want the MAC to be fairly large, say 32bits, but you might not want a 4 gigabyte (say) S-box, so you mightwork on 4 byte-sized S-boxes, but I think that is an irrelevant detailfor the discussion at hand.Who will be first to point out my errors, or give me a pointer to someliterature?--Greg Rose                 Australian Computing and Communications Instituteggr@acci.com.au                                              +61 18 174 842`Use of the standard phrase "HIJACKED" may be inadvisable' -- CAA

That's especially true forsci.crypt.  For that matter, I've created alt.privacy.clipper, sincethe traffic is appearing in *many* different groups right now.I'm going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan, hence myfollowup to sci.crypt.  Frankly, if you're not an absolutist, yourfeelings may turn on some of these issues.  For example -- with an80-bit key, simply splitting it into two 40-bit pieces is much lessacceptable than other schemes, because it means that if just onerepository is, shall we say, overly pliable, a would-be eavesdropperwould need to recover just 40 more bits of key.  I need not point outin this newsgroup that that's pretty easy to do by exhaustive search.A slightly more complex scheme -- XOR-ing the key with a random number,and then with its complement -- would produce two 80-bit subkeys,neither of which is useful alone.  That variant is much more resistantto attack.  Clearly, one can get even more sophisticated, to protectthe subkeys even more.Other thoughts...  Some people have noted the size and complexity ofthe databases necessary.  But the id strings the phones emit could betheir back door key, double-encrypted with the escrow repositories'public keys.  For that matter, they could do that only with sessionkeys, and have no back door at all.  In that case, the FBI would haveto bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted.  Thiswould answer many of the objections along the lines of ``how do youmake sure they stop''.We can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony backdoor -- have the switch do the tap, but with a digitally-signed recordof the time, phone number, etc, of the call.  That provides proof tothe escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms ofthe warrant.I can suggest other variations, too.  Suppose each Clipper chip had 100public key pairs.  Each would be used ~10 times, after which you'd needmore keying material.  (Not a bad idea in any event.)  This could beused to enforce time limits, or rather, usage limits, on each warrant;the keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn't last for verylong.I suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure.  Apart fromthe obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when you've already got theback door? -- I think that the government is still genuinely concernedabout foreign espionage, especially aimed at commercial targets.  Thisscheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it, too.  (I've heardrumors, over the years, that some factions within NSA were unhappy withDES because it was too good.  Not that they couldn't crack it, but itwas much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd want.)  They're keepingthe details secret so that others don't build their own implementationswithout the back door.The cryptographic protocol, though, is another matter.  I see no validreasons for keeping it secret, and -- as I hope I've shown above -- thereare a lot of ways to do things that aren't (quite) as bad.

Suppose I also design a simple algorithm based onthis information which takes the data containing the encrypted sessionkey and twiddles a bit (or several) before it's sent down the line.Mind you, I'm sure the NSA thought of this along with a dozen otherattacks I can't imagine, and the system is probably somehow designedso that manipulation of this information will cause a compliantreceiving chip to somehow fail to decrypt successfully.  But how?What if the two parties agree in advance on some kind of consistentbit-twiddling scheme, so the decryption chip sees the restored"proper" bitstream but an eavesdropper gets a E[K; UK] packet that'swrong?I suppose this could be easily defeated if the chip "sends" thatinformation out many times in slightly different ways, making iteffectively impossible to be certain you know all the informationbeing sent.--Marc VanHeyningen   mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu   MIME & RIPEM acceptedIf your theory predicts different outcomes depending on whether you usediscrete mathematics or continuous mathematics, then you've got the wrongtheory.- Bruce MacLennan

The name of the companyis Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the endof this message on how to contact them).   Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons thatwe are. More specifically however, Mr. Bryen of Secure Communicationsbrought to light many points that might interest most of the readers.   His belief is that AT&T was made known of the clipper well before therest of the industry. This is for several reasons, several of which are: - A company of AT&T's size could never be able to make a decision to use   the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced. - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT&T's secure telephone   devices. AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all.   This stuck them as strange, until now...   Also I spoke with Art Melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed severalconcerns over the new Clipper Chip:  - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.  - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto    system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency    of the government.  - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm    is vulnerable over time to an attacker.  - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that    it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or    changing the keys themselves.  - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and    money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed    engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very    difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique    to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is    hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.Additonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn't tellme much about their new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet.However he told me a little: - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been   granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is   secure. - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm.   The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret   until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate   the following:    - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but      Mr. Melnick stated "Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out.")    - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES.    - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA).    - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that      it is _adujustable_ and is "More than adequate for security."    - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and      can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which      is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I      consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use.    - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques      such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the      hardware chip.    - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars      for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced      enough, which probably won't happen]).    - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm      and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted      data into "blocks." This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know      what the block header is. This program operates at all supported      RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm.    - Most importantly: IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!!Right now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them outof business. This is a very real possibility. So they really need help instopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard.

Comments  are invited. - Paul )In alt.privacy.clipper, Steve Bellovin posted your message tohim, which included a brief passage concerning selection of agenciesas escrow agencies.I am glad to see that the proposal as written states that the escrowagencies won't be law enforcement agencies. I would argue, however,that *one* of the escrow agencies shouldn't be federal at all.As a private citizen, I would feel much more "secure in my person andpapers" knowing that an organization committed to individual civilliberties- the ACLU and the NRA come to mind- was safeguarding half ofmy key. Both the ACLU and the NRA are resistent to government pressureby the simple expedient fact that they are not supported, funded, orovertly controlled by the government.Of those federal and federally funded candidate agencies that youmentioned, I have the following comments:- SRI, Rand, Mitre, and national labs: I agree that they have        great experience safeguarding sensitive information. I am not        convinced that they would adequately safeguard _this_information, since in any case requiring disclosure, there's      likely to be sigificant pressure for disclosure- possibly *wrongful* disclosure.- GAO: perhaps. I would like to see more concrete evidence of their fidelity and ability.- *TREASURY*? Surely you're joking. Perhaps you'd ask BATFto safeguard keys. Maybe the Federal Reserve would be a better choice.Ever since last fall's "trial balloon" was posted in sci.crypt, yourname has been synonymous with those who place a great deal of trust inthe ability of government agencies and agents to act within the law.I agree with you in part: those agencies and agents *almost always*act properly. However, there have been enough cases where _swornagents of the Federal Government_ have acted wrongly to make me feelthat having two federal agencies as key repositories is unacceptable.Respectfully,-Paul Robichaux (not speaking for NTI, BCSS, or NASA)-- Paul Robichaux, KD4JZG                | HELP STOP THE BIG BROTHER CHIP!NTI Mission Software Development Div. | RIPEM key on request.

But, if you are making custom equipment in any case, why not justroll your own Clipper implementation and report the wrong keys to theEscrow agency?  (Tells us who is going to be in the chip business ifthis thing goes through--NSA, and those with something to hide fromNSA.)  If anyone can verify that your phone is not using the key registeredto that serial number, either:  1) They have a court ordered wiretap.  But what are they going todo?  Tell the judge that this individual really does have privacy?All they know is that the keys are not enough, but not why.  2) They have a court ordered wiretap on a phone in this series.(This part is really scary.  Since the "expectation" is that allchips in a particular batch will uses seeds based on the same S1 andS2 and the serial number, getting the keys for one of a batch may giveaccess to all.)  3) There is a backdoor which allows all messages to be decipheredwithout the keys.  I find this one especially threatening since thescheme seems very open to known plaintext attacks.  (What I need todecipher is the data in the header.  If I talk to someone who has oneof these phones, presumably there will be an automatically negotiatedkey generated.  I'm not trying to decipher the record of theconversation to know what was said, I use it as a known plaintext torecover the backdoor represented by the header, but I know what theheader says for conversations I participate in.  Even worse, if thephones in a series have related keys, I can buy a phone/chip from thesame production lot.  Then I can recover its keys, either elegantly bytalking to myself, or by brute force analysis of the actual chip, thenapply the key generation process with those seeds to find the targetkeys.)

I suggest the Supreme Court, or, regionally, theCourts of Appeal.  More specifically, the offices of their Clerks.       Courts already operate substantial record-keeping operations.  Someof these records are confidential.  So the concept of a court holdinginformation in confidence in accordance with law has longstanding legal precedents.  The judiciary is more immune to pressure from the executivebranch than any executive branch agency or contractor can be.  So judicialcontrol of keys is appropriate.       For the other half of the key, I suggest a unit of Congress, theGeneral Accounting Office.  The GAO is Congress's staff unit for keepingtabs on the Executive Branch, and has an excellent reputation.  It'scontrolled strictly by Congress; the Executive Branch has no authorityover it.       With keys split between the Legislative and Judicial branches,we might have a chance of this system working honestly.  If, of course,a way can be found to keep the keys from being siphoned off beforethey reach the repositories.       This should not be construed as an endorsement by me of thewhole Clipper concept.  But if we have to have it, splitting controlacross all three branches of government might make it work.John Nagle

Just about the only circumstances in which I could think that they would be interested in their political views would be to recruit them as spooks. They can be guaranteed to givethe government line when it counts. In US history it has been the socialists such as myself who have been persecuted. Now before people start asserting that there is no mechanism by whichthe administration can get their new chip adopted without legal forcelets try thinking.In the first place the clipper chip must have existed for several years asa defense project. Therefore this is not a party matter at all. George Bushwas in any case hardly adverse to tapping calls, he was chief spook remember.Secondly the govt can quite easily apply pressure. They simply "ask" theirchums who they give huge defense contracts to (motorola etc) to be "nice"boys. After all Bill is giving them a nice little trade monopoly since thechips won't be avaliable to foreign firms.Thirdly the people who consider the Democrats to be socialist are not thesame as the ones who consider socialists to be communist. People might knowthis if the US education system did not suffer from the Mcarthyite and Dewy version of political correctness - the sort with tribunals and show trials. Ever seen Ed Meese pissed? I have, it was when he said that socialismand communism were the same thing and brought the house down with laughter.It took several minutes before we realised that he was serious.Phill Hallam-BakerPhill Hallam-Baker

Theymight only know who one side of the conversation is, for example.Anyone who thinks the govt is forbidden by law to cross-correlate suchdatabases loses two points. First, law enforcement agencies can ofcourse do this. Second, they're only forbidden from BUDGETING anymoney for it. The IRS, for example, does do this anyhow. They justdon't spend any money on it so it's (technically) legal I guess.Instead they probably trade little favors with companies likemastercard (if you're the IRS I'll bet you have a *lot* ofopportunities to trade favors with major corps for their databases.)I know, an IRS guy read an amazing list off to me (from his screen, Icould hear him typing to pull up each screen) once on the phone duringa dispute I had with them (to intimidate me, actually, not much of adispute, I didn't particularly disagree, but for some reason thisfellow wanted to play tough guy with me, I hope he's better now.)Amazing stuff he had at his finger tips.

[It will encourage the *FBI* tocommit (even more) criminal acts, but that's not the point here.]But this gives another avenue of attack on the Clipper proposal.  Whenthe EFF/ACLU/CPSR FOIA requests are made, they should ask for detailson the bureaucratic and equipment infrastructure that is proposed (or even already budgeted) for the FBI to service tapping requests -- for nowand the projected future. From these figures, estimate the number of Clipper-tap requests the FBIis expecting.  Publish this figure.  Compare it on a per-capita basiswith the amount of tapping now known or suspected.Also estimate how expensive it would be for the FBI to install moreClipper-tapping stations, and how rapidly they could be built andinstalled ... ie, get the "plus or minus" epsilon for the near future.Might be a mite disturbing for J.

Also, how does oneverify that what you are looking at is reflected in tapeout, or masks?The silicon should be examined as well, the design in hand (a clean roompublicly defined clipper chip) can be merged with another design later, orchanged between completion and mask out.  There is little proof that whatyou are told is in the chip is all that is in the chip.Put the (verified) masks in escrow, and use them for chip production,use a third escrow party for programming the chips. The government is asking for a lot of blind trust:  the encryption algorithm, operating protocols, the agency having physical control of the devices, the silicon implementation.  If the  government is so trustworthy, why escrowanything?

Just pryoff the top of the chip and start scanning it with the electronmicrocope and figure out the circuitry. I remembered a place that I useto work for had one of these facilities that they used to analyze chipsthat we accidently blew out while running tests. They could actually findthe area that was fried and show us where in the circuit it was. I am sure that many companies and universities must have these facilitiesand that the potential is there, especially at a university where thesecurity at such a facility is looser, for someone to take a clipperapart and analyze it?What can the government do to prevent this?

Rather than use technology to accommodatethe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy andlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government againstindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years toprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used toprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryptiontechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and theunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be usedby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the "Clipper Chip" hasbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents anew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached toan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communicationsusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many incommercial use today.This new technology will help companies protect proprietaryinformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversationsand prevent unauthorized release of data transmittedelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves theability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies tointercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. A "key-escrow" system will be established to ensure that the"Clipper Chip" is used to protect the privacy of law-abidingAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                2"keys," numbers that will be needed by authorized governmentagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When thedevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separatelyin two "key-escrow" data bases that will be established by theAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited togovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct awiretap.The "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with nonew authorities to access the content of the privateconversations of Americans.To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, theAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the newdevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside thegovernment will be offered access to the confidential details ofthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly reporttheir findings.The chip is an important step in addressing the problem ofencryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect theprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shieldcriminals and terrorists.  We need the "Clipper Chip" and otherapproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with accessto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using itto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technologytrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),the President has directed government agencies to develop acomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone          calls and data, under proper court or other legal          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern          technology to build the National Information          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and          the competitiveness of American industry in the global          marketplace; and      --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export          high technology products.The President has directed early and frequent consultations withaffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate theprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                3The Administration is committed to working with the privatesector to spur the development of a National InformationInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computertechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access toinformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks("information superhighways") will transmit video, images, HDTVprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephonesystem transmits voice.Since encryption technology will play an increasingly importantrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must actquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regardingits use.  The Administration is committed to policies thatprotect all Americans' right to privacy while also protectingthem from those who break the law.Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the newencryption technology are also available.  For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute ofStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.---------------------------------QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'STELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVEQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?A:   No.  "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with     no new authorities to access the content of the private     conversations of Americans.Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to     decipher the message?A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They     would then present documentation of this authorization to     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key     escrow system.Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will     oversee the key-escrow data banks.Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure     how strong the security is?  A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all     potential users that there are no unrecognized     vulnerabilities.Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet     officials.Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the     decisions related to this initiative.Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?A:   The government designed and developed the key access     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip     manufacturer that produces them.Q:   Who provides the "Clipper Chip"?A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed     to other vendors in the future.Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating     the "Clipper Chip" into their devices.     Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more     powerful encryption devices?A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive     than others readily available today, but it is just one     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to     encryption technology, which the Administration is     developing.     The Administration is not saying, "since encryption     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,     we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries have     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that "every     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an     unbreakable commercial encryption product."  There is a     false "tension" created in the assessment that this issue is     an "either-or" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,     balanced approach such as is proposed with the "Clipper     Chip" and similar encryption techniques.Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from     that of the Bush Administration?  A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption     technology in telecommunications and computing and are     committed to working with industry and public-interest     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime     and terrorism.Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use     the government hardware?A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability     of these products.

Of course, you have tobelieve that the NSA/FBI/name-your-favorite-government agency willknow SK so all it needs is the S1/S2 pairs, and presto, nasty details like court orders for wire taps are no longer necessary.Now, I'm not one of the people who distrusts the government at everyturn, but taking someone's word for it that the S1/S2 pairs are not keptaround is pushing what I'm willing to believe just a little bit too far.-- Steve Tate srt@cs.duke.edu | The reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem,Dept. of Computer Science  | above all other sciences, is that its laws areDuke University     | absolutely certain and indisputable, while those of allDurham, NC  27706   | other sciences are to some extent debatable.

If not, how fancy does the compression need to be?A good vocoder like ours will give you 8000 bits per second locked atfull rate (it's a variable rate voice activity vocoder).  If you wantless quality, cut that to 4000 bps (half rate).  At full rate variableyou could put two full-duplex conversations on a V.32bis modem.  Thisrequires a DSP or ASICs, though.  An RS-6000 has a CPU that couldprobably do it in real-time, because it has the add-and-multiplyinstruction and a few other DSP things.If you want to do speech in real-time you need about 4000 samples asecond (for not very good voice) with your 8 bit samples (ISDN is 80008-bit samples a second), which is 32 kbps.  You could do a fast 2:1compression on that to get it down to 16 kbps, which is just aboutV.32bis.  The quality at this point is very bleah, but it should work.Now add in the time for your encryption method.  You're going to needsampling hardware, which is no problem on a new Mac, an Amiga.  Or aPC with a SoundBlaster card (just because they're so popular and cheap- you could also build a simple ADC).  The problem with theSoundBlaster is that it doesn't seem to be full duplex - you can'tsample and play backq at the same time, making a two-way conversationa bit tough.  The special hardware or a more capable sound card may berequired.The only thing that worries me is that 2:1 compression - theSoundBlaster can do it automatically in hardware, but other than thatI don't have a good feel for how processor intensive it is, so I can'testimate how fast a PC you'd need.-- Not all men who drink are poets.  Some of us drink because we are not poets.
