See the difference?Just for the record ( not that any kind of information would belikely to affect your thinking ) I have an MSEE -- focus inElectromagnetics -- from Penn.A photo of the smallest logo in the world does not an atom make.What was observed is something we can measure that matches what the mathematical model we call an atom had predicted.  Much in the same way that we need BOTH a particle model and awave model for light, the atomic model is a mathematicalrepresentation of physical phenomena.  A model that can andprobably will continue to change over time.  That makes it subjective (the model that is).  However, the model gives us anobjective way to talk about the physical world.To put it another way, the Quantum Mechanical model of the atomallows for discussion of the atom that will give repeatable andunambiguous results, which is objective.  However, as Bohr andEinstein duked it out mid-century, the interpretation ofthose reapeatable, observable measurements is quite subjective.Bohr said that the observable randomness of atomic motion wasinherent in the nature of the universe.  Einstein said particlemotion was deterministic, but it was our measurement shortcomingsthat introduced the randomness.  They were talking about theEXACT same results, though.-jim halat

Accuracy is a value judgement, too.  It so happens I agree with the substance of what you say below, but it's clear to me that at least *some* values are objective.  Truth is better than falsehood, peace isbetter than war, education is better than ignorance.  We know these things,if we know anything.#Assuming, for the moment, that morals _are_ relative, then two#relativists can recognize that neither has a lock on the absolute#truth and they can proceed to negotiate a workable compromise that#produces the desired results.No they cannot, because they acknowledge up front that THE desiredresults do not exist.  That, after all, is the meaning of compromise.Plus some problems: If the relativists have no values in common, compromise is impossible - what happens then?    Who, if anyone, is right?  What happens if one relativist has a value "Never compromise?".  A value "plant bombs in crowded shopping areas"?  After all, if morals are relative, these values cannot *meaningfully* be said to be incorrect.#Assuming that there is an absolute morality, two disagreeing #objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right; there#is no room for compromise.  Once you beleive in absolute morals,#you must accept that you are amoral or that everyone who disagrees#with you is amoral.Untrue.  One can accept that one does not know the whole truth.

Letterman:  "Are youlike me?  Do you like science and medicine?").Difference is that science is based on consensus.  The points above arewell made,  and obviously there is some discussion as to what thefacts are in some cases.  But if you are willing to play along withthe definitions,  you too can hit the jackpot.  Science also tends touse the principle of totality (vs locality).  You can always look at asmall part of the macrocosm,  yet those miniature pieces are still apart of the total essence.  So the facts to observe are those whichpertain to what questions you're asking.  You may place a value on thequestions,  but in many case,  they are being asked just for the sakeof asking.  And you can say that you're looking at a signal instead oflistening to noise,  but the beauty of science is that it takes bothinto account (the totality aspect).  For science to say that light isa wave and NOT a particle (or vice versa) would be to ignore the totalessence that is light (which is based upon the agreed upon definitions).Why even have definitions?  Why agree upon them?  Well, to communicate insuch a way so that many will understand what you are saying.  Where thecuriosity and drive come from I don't honestly know.I hope I haven't rambled too much.

I'm curious to know what purpose people think these lists serve.Lists like this seem to value quantity over quality, an "argumentfrom article length."  And the list you have here is of poorerquality than most.  Since the quotes seem to be taken from anon-line bible, I doubt that there will be much problem withverses quoted inaccurately.  But that isn't the problem here.I've known a lot of fundamentalists in my life, but none whodenied that there were errors in transmission, etc.  And many ofthe contradictions here -- Solomon having 40,000 horse stalls inone verse, and 4,000 in another -- are just the sort ofcontradiction that fundies don't have a problem with, in myexperience.  So how do these sorts of contradictions amount toanything more than attacking a straw man?Some of the others are just silly, or rely on taking quotes outof context, or have reasonable explanations.  But even the onesthat are genuine contradictions need to have more said aboutthem than what is given here.  (At the very least, some effortshould be made to understand and respond to the common repliesgiven by fundies.)  Look for example at the research that DaveButler put into an article examining a false prophecy about Tyre.That would be an excellent start for an anti-inerrancy list thatwould have some teeth.  (One well-researched and documentedcontradiction is worth more than one hundred quotes taken outof context and thrown together in a list.)Lists like this that just toss a bunch of quotes together tomake a bible verse salad just don't cut it.  Those of us whowant to argue against inerrancy should find this sort of thingas embarassing as the fundies should find Josh McDowell.djP.S. You can find some good material at ftp.rutgers.edu in/pub/soc.religion.christian/others/contradictions.  The qualityis very uneven on both sides of the argument (it is just acompilation of things many people have written), but some ofit would be useful in an anti-inerrancy FAQ.  After exams, Imight be willing to help put it together.

Being able to distinguish some egregious terrorist from some saintly man of peace does not mean that you have a method for tellingwho's a terrorist in general.Of course we *try* to tell them apart, but for my moneyit's better to try with the full awareness that we allbring bias to the judgement than to imagine that we areusing some objective test.jon.

In many types ofexperiments the "prediction" is that the observed phenomena will happen againand be capable of being observed. For example, in chemistry someone may predict: the outcome of a chemical reaction and then actually observe that reactionrepeatedly. You can't repeat or ever know for sure the original conditions that produced life. So it seems we could never say, "That's exactly how it happened."As far as we know that event was unobserved. (At least no one has admitted: it. :-) ) So unlike the chemistry experiment repeatability and observability,: strictly speaking, are lacking.: -- Can't resist, because I've thought about it...Basically what is being constructed is a theory of abiogenesis.There are any number of criterion that would have to be satisfied forthe theory to be accurate, such as the hotly discussed topic ofstereoisomerism.  Just making life in the lab wouldn't suffice (forall the wonder that would engender!), because for the theory ofabiogenesis to be accurate, the life would have to resemble the bestidea we have of what the earliest lifeforms resembled.Comes down to that old question "Can we ever really be sure?"But if were to examine a claim that abiogenesis had beendemonstrated in the laboratory AND was the most likely path followed onprimordial Earth, I would look for the following:1)  Experiment reproduced a plausible primordial Earthenvironment;2)  ALL contamination sources were eliminated;3)  The lifeform produced resembles primitive/simple Earthlifeforms;4)  The theory accounts for differences in the modernEarth environment and primitive Earth environment.NOW, if those criteria were satisfied, Dr. Abio, who performed theexperiment, would then be in possession of the best candidate fora theory of abiogenesis on the primordial Earth.  At which point Dr.BBio could then counter with a decisive critique keyed on an aspectof the theory which doesn't match the early Earth environment, ora characteristic of the new "lifeform" that doesn't resemble lifeon Earth.  Were he to suggest an improvement to eliminate thediscrepancies, and perform an experiment to demonstrate his claims,Dr. BBio would then have the best theory.Never provable;  constantly modifiable;  progressing evercloser to the "correct" answer, until the evidence is overwhelming(and even when it is, a theory that explains even MORE may take itsplace) ------- that's a scientific theory.===========================================================|  James G.

At least, they are as objectively realas anything is.>I don't think I'm way off beam in saying that "something is>better than nothing" is a rational and objective valuation. The term 'rational' does not apply to a simple statement like that.You would have to include the statement within a syllogism andassert the rationility of the syllogism.A statement is just a statement.  As to its objectivity - well it depends what you mean.Values tend to be regarded as good or bad, valid or invalid, true or false,and so on.  Objective values are those which must fall into one or other ofthose options for all people - or, if you are prepared for dissent, thenthey are those values which should be accepted by everyone.If someone rejects an objective value they are regarded as 'wrong'.Objective values require a fundamental notion of good versus bad, or atleast right versus wrong (or even just correct versus incorrect) anda way of relating that to specific aspects of human behaviour.In my opinion that requires a belief in a deity of some sort.Suppose you could predict with almost 100% accuracy that Americansbelieved that something is better than nothing.You could usefully say that the existence of that value was anobjective fact.  You could not say that the value itself wasobjective.   You could not do that unless you could prove that thevalue was 'right'.  Showing that everyone happens to accept the valueas right doesn't show that it is right.>Do you agree with me then that the assertion "no values are objective" >is false?Well I am a believer in a God.  So I do believe that some values areobjective.  But I usually suspend that belief when posting to t.abecause it immediately invalidates subsequent arguments in the mindof many t.a readers.So, ignoring the idea of a God, I disagree with you.I believe, in this limited context, that 'no values are objective'.But I think that this thread is showing some cross-purpose debate.I think I understand your use of the word 'objective' whenrelating it to values.  I think it is an unusual usage, but Ibelieve you are consistent given that usage.tommy

If you're interested in a change, here's an idea.Do you believe in absolute morality? And do you have absoluteknowledge? Mere mortal you? And if you claim that your God has absoluteknowledge, then you have have absolute knowledge of that?If you read the Bible and claim that it is the Word of God, andin it is contained the absolute moral code you ascribe to, but the prophets,no matter how divinely inspired are not gods but mere fallable mortals,then how can you be absolutely sure that they having heard the Word ofGod, have got it right? Also, you read their words in translation whichinvariably introduces errors of nuance and usage, and then how do youknow that you got the right message? I assert that you do not, and thatyou do not have absolute knowledge of anything, including absolute morals.The only way you can assert such things is through appeal toprejudice via appeal by force of authority through yourself or a groupyou have aligned yourself to.>If morals come from what is societally accepted, why follow that? Because social pressure is the most powerful force known toman. How can you disprove a contention that the richeousness ofestablished religion is anything other than social convention? Oneway is to assert that there are moral universals. But that is notthe same thing as asserting that these universials owe their origento trancendance or the supernatural or to dieties.>What right do>we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally mandated morality?We expect empathy from our fellow man. We expect to raise eachgeneration with values that we live by, those which assure that mistakeswe have made are not repeated. Do you think that mere authority checksall tendancies which are disruptive of civilized life? I think not! In factauthority is power, and power corrupts. The most powerful tend to thinkthat they are above the law that applies to everybody else. Religiousauthority, theocarcy, has not mitigated this any better than otherpower structures on this score and it seems that because there are nochecks on power concentrated in clergy or nobility that the abusesrecorded by history are greater.We live and teach morals by setting an example, starting inthe home. This does not come from books or authority figures insoceity. If people are weak or confused at the present time it isnot because the breakup of the family has been precipitated by somemysterious moral decidance that redidication to traditional formulaswill repair. That is but magical and simplistic thinking. We need tolook at forces in the way we live, even the good things that happenin our present culture, that are weakening the family as the primarymeans we have to teach children values. Of course people are tryingto have the community do things that once were done in the familyalone. This may not be as effective. We need to look at this.>Pardon the extremism, but couldn't I murder your "brother" and say> that I was >exercising my rights as I saw them, was doing what felt good, didn't want>anyone forcing their morality on me, or I don't follow your "morality" ?Laying down the law, and with teeth, doesn't stop the crazyman from murdering your brother despite the morality or the law. Itmay help you with dealing promptly with him after the fact, but itmay not be very effective for preventing mental illness or cracy peoplefrom murduring.It is quite interesting how ineffective moral authoritarianismis in fact. It may work best in societies that are already sonmewhatisolated, that do not experience change, and have long standingtraditions. In a basic way moral codes decrease the number of decisionspeople have to make everyday. In a real sense thay allow people to nothave to think. That is OK when things are stable, but it becomes aproblem when conditions change. This leads me to think that morals arenot sumething fundemental, at least most of them, recalling that thereare values all people seem to agree on, but mutate in response to outsidepolitical, economic, technical, and cultural influiences.Lately, I have come to regard people who speak like youwith great suspicion, especially when they include the pharse "forthe children.". I think that such people are more of an imparative towant to  control what others do and think than other more nobil pursuits,such as of the truth.Bruce Salem

The thing is,as you no doubt have already been told, that Genesis 1 does not constitutea scientific theory.  Given a scientific theory of the origin of the universeor earth or anything else, we can decide what sort of things we expect to betrue about today's universe.  What predictions does Genesis 1 make abouttoday's universe that disagree with the standard "scientific" version,and how can we test them?If this is what you want to do, keep in mind that, despite the considerablelength of time t.o has existed, no one has yet succeeded.>-->****************************************************************>                                                    Michael A.

Who is he? >Please do not answer with "A well known evolutionist" or some other such>informationless phrase.   Francis Hitching is the author of, among other books,_The Neck of the Giraffe_." He believes evolution isdirected by some sort of cosmic force, but does not likeDarwinism.  He wrote in this book [ _The Neck of theGiraffe_, Ticknor & Fields, New Haven, Connecticut, 1982,p. 12 (p. 4, paperback)] that:   For all its acceptance in the scientific world as the   great unifying principle of biology, Darwinism, after   a century and a quarter, is in a surprising amount of   trouble.  Evolution and Darwinism are often taken to   mean the same thing.  But they don't.  Evolution of   life over a very long period of time is a fact, if we   are to believe evidence gathered during the last two   centuries from geology, paleontology, molecular biol-   ogy and many other scientific disciplines.  Despite   the many believers in Divine creation who dispute this   ..., the probability that evolution has occurred   approaches certainty in scientific terms....  On the   other hand Darwinism (or neo-Darwinism, its modern   version) is a theory that seeks to explain evolution.   It has not, contrary to general belief, and despite   very great efforts, been proved.   Research on Hitching turned up the following: Hitching isbasically a sensational TV script writer and has no scien-tific credentials.  In _The Neck of the Giraffe_ he claimedto be a member of the Royal Archaeological Institute, but aninquiry to that institute said he was not.  He implied inthe "Acknowledgements" of _The Neck of the Giraffe_ thatpaleontologist Stephen Jay Gould had helped in the writingof the book, but upon inquiry Gould said he did not know himand had no information about him.  Hitching also impliedthat his book had been endorsed by Richard Dawkins, but uponinquiry Dawkins stated: "I know nothing at all about FrancisHitching.  If you are uncovering the fact that he is a char-latan, good for you.  His book, _The Neck of the Giraffe,_is one of the silliest and most ignorant I have read foryears."   Hitching believes in the paranormal and has written onMayan pyramid energy and for some "In Search Of..." episodeson BBC television.  The reference work _ContemporaryAuthors,_ Vol. 103, page 208, lists him as a member of theSociety for Psychical Research, the British Society ofDowsers and of the American Society of Dowsers.  His writ-ings include: _Earth Magic,_ _Dowsing: The Psi Connection,__Mysterious World: An Atlas of the Unexplained,_ _Fraud,Mischief, and the Supernatural_ and _Instead of Darwin_.   Hitching's book spends much of its time attacking Dar-winian evolution, borrowing heavily and uncritically fromyoung-earth creationist arguments.  Many of Hitching's "ref-erences" are lifted from young-earth creationist literaturerather than being quoted directly from their originalsources.  One magazine had this to say [_Creation/EvolutionNewsletter_, 7, No. 5, pp. 15-16, September/October 1987]:   Speaking of the Biblical Creation Society, there was   an interesting letter in the January 1983 issue of   their journal Biblical Creation (p. 74) concerning a   review of Francis Hitching's 1982 book _The Neck of   the Giraffe_.  Hitching's book is strongly anti-   Darwinist, and is enthusiastically hailed by most cre-   ationists (though he also pokes fun at fundamentalist   creationists).  The letter, by creationist Malcolm   Bowden (author of _The Rise of the Evolution Fraud_),   points out that Hitching simply "culled his informa-   tion from the creationist literature."  This is indeed   the case:  many creationist works are cited favorably   (Anderson, Coffin, Clark, Daly, Davidheiser, Dewar,   Gish, Morris, Segraves, Whitcomb, and Wysong, plus   various anti-Darwinists).  Hitching does cite Bowden's   earlier book _Ape-Men -- Fact or Fallacy?_, but Bowden   accuses Hitching of "lifting" several passages and   illustrations from his book without acknowledgment:   in other words, plagiarism.  "Hitchin's [sic] book is   largely an exposition of the creationists [sic] view-   point from the beginning to almost the end," Bowden   points out....  Hitching is also a paranormalist, an   advocate of psychic evolution.... [Hitching's book]   _Earth Magic_ is a wild, extremely entertaining and   thoroughly psychic interpretation of megalithic struc-   tures....  Hitching also includes in his scheme cosmic   cataclysms, Atlantis, pyramidology, dowsing, ESP,   miraculous healing, and astrology.-------------------------------------------------------Alan Feuerbacheralanf@atlas.pen.tek.com

All of the writers musthave received their information from the early Christians,perhaps second or third hand.  None of these references give anyhint that the writers had any independent information aboutJesus. These references do show that the early Christians were having aninfluence, at least enough to earn a few lines here and there inother peoples' writings.  But the typical use to which they areput by some Christian apologists, in making psuedo-historicalarguments a la Josh, is totally specious.Russell

Luckily these parameters are fixed by reality.Suppose X-ist saucers land.  The aliens destroy all paper currency and tattoo"666" on people's foreheads and start sacrificing small children.  Then abunch of other aliens come along and offer to get rid of the X-ists in returnfor one dollar.  The people happen to have a single dollar bill hidden duringthe purge.Get the point?  None of these events are *inherently* impossible.  So it isnot the case that the value of a dollar bill is fixed by reality.For a more mundane example of how the value of a dollar bill is not constant,consider the following game thought up by the RAND corporation:You are with a bunch of friends.  You have a $10 bill.  You offer to sell the$10 bill to the highest bidder -- subject to the restriction that you alsoget to take the money bid by the second-highest bidder.Try it.  You'll find that sometimes people will end up bidding more than $10for your $10 bill.mathew

It should be clear from my response to Bill Rawlins above that in this thread I am objecting only to the use of Josephus to validate the messiah claim.  The argument against themessiah claim is not weak (maybe mine is, but in the hands of pros it is not).There are indeed two passages.  The short one *cannot be used* to validate themessiah claim, imo.  That's why I refered to the long, which can be used.  It flatly states Jesus "was the Christ", and mentions the crucifixion, resurrection and Christian belief in said claims.The short entry mentions Jesus in passing as James' brother - "... brother ofJesus, who *was called* the Christ, .... [emphasis mine]", and that's it. If original, Josephus has merely reported what some people say.  It is nothing more than an observation, one which lacks the Christian fundamentals.The long is widely regarded as an insert for three reasons: 1) its way out ofcontext, 2) Origen evidently knew nothing of it, and 3) its rather inconsistentwith the short.  There is consensus among scholars as defined on the long as insert, and I see Jim agrees.  Consensus is usually reflected subtly, as inElaine Pagel's _Gnostic Gospels_ (p. 85), "A comment *attributed* to Josephusreports ....[emphasis mine]".  As for #2, I mentioned in my original post that the long is a 3rd century insert (more properly, post-Origen as Jim notes).There may not be consensus on the short.  The text, which discusses James in alegal role, stands with or without it.  That it does not upset context makes itdifficult to argue insert.  On the other hand, an in-passing insert is easilydisguised in any context.  Nonetheless, on historiographical grounds it is worthless for the messiah defense, and that's why I didn't mention it. I don't know about the Arabic ms.  If you have a translation reference, Jim,please let me know.  As for its "much less gung-ho" tone, obviously the date of this ms. is critical.  If after ca. AD 700, a watered-down entry in lieu of removal can be easily explained.*<(:-)Rich Fox, Anthro, Usouthdakota

It is simple; I believe that the odds againstthere being only one universe and that universe having the right conditionsto support us are infinate. I believe that to explain our existance inthis universe it is necessary to either consider multiple universes(an infinate number of them) or intelligent design. Since the onlyintelligence that we know of is of a higher order than simple matter(the brain is made of matter) by Ockham's razor I go for the firstchoice.What's more, there are a couple of books out dealing with popularscience that use parallel universes and holographic universes (whichis another way of saying parallel) to explain the behavior of particalsat the quantum level. One is called Parallel Universes, and I think itis by Wolf, the other The Holographic Universe.BTW, the parallel universe approach implys an element of mind in thevery physical reality of the universe. >Bruce Salem>eric

Although it isoften used in a colloquial manner to refer to phenomena that tendtoward higher complexity and ability, evolution simply implies change,for good or for bad.  In the scientific sense, evolution is merely thechange in allele frequencies for a given population over a period oftime.  This is usually what people refer to when they discuss thescientific fact of evolution.  We observe such shifts in allelefrequencies occurring all the time, so it is trivial to conclude thatevolution is a scientific fact.The mechanisms that enable such changes in allele frequencies arecollectively known as the theory of evolution.  Darwin's naturalselection is one such theory.  Genetic drift is another.  Gene flow isstill another.Evolution is a fact and a theory.

This is the root of the problem: I bloomin' well amn't punning on theword value!!!  I know it's ambiguous.  I've told you the sense inwhich I'm using it (worth, use, goodness, etc).  And value DOESN'T meanaccuracy, by any stretch of the imagination.  Value=result of a computation,is not what I mean, but I accept it as a possible misinterpretation of'value'.  Value == accuracy comes from out of left field.  I can only understand that by '"useful in making some conclusion" is an accuracyjudgement' you mean one can judge whether it is *really* useful in makingthat conclusion or not.   That's part of what I mean by objectivevaluation - values grounded in solid facts.  One doesn't value x for the purpose y if all the evidence suggests that x doesn't really do that. Therest of what I mean is that the really fundamental values (e.g.  our own freedom) are solid facts in themselves.Consider each of the following statements:(1) The only reason that the distinction between 'accurate' and 'inaccurate' exists at all is that a group of people finds it useful.  (2) The main reason that science exists at all is that a group of peoplefinds the distinction between 'accurate' and 'inaccurate' useful indealing with phenomena.(3) Scientists find simple theories with accurate predictions useful inmodelling phenomena.Where is the 'pun' of which you speak?  Where am I arguing from idiom?  And what is wrong, if those statements are true, with concluding that "the basis of science is its *judged* usefulness in dealing with phenomena, i.e. 'subjective' values"?    After all, what on earth is (3), if not a 'subjective' value judgement?  (an 'accurate' value judgement, maybe?)Just to illustrate what I mean: what's the difference between saying'simple theories with accurate predictions are the best tools we haveto model phenomena' and (say) 'Love and intelligence are the best tools we haveto achieve freedom'?  Is one 'objective', the other not?  Both are judgements about value ("best"), and both have the same empirical basis, from where _I_ sit.#Sorry, Frank, but all you're doing is#using the ambiguity of English to obfuscate the issue. IF you#mean to say that science is based on value (accuracy) judgements,#I have no problem with that. If you mean to say that it's based#on value (goodness) judgements, that's nonsense. By contrast,#morality is clearly based on goodness judgements.I'm afraid I do mean to say that it's based on "goodness" judgements."Simple theories with accurate predictions are better (_better_, BETTER) tools for interpreting reality than complex theories with inaccurate predictions" is a fundamental value judgement that scientists make.

The concepts of "right"and "wrong" (or "correct/incorrect" or "true/false") belong to thedomain of epistemological rather than moral questions.  It makes nosense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it islegitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivativesof epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation, respectively.One can certainly ask if a percept is "right" (correct, true,veridical) or "wrong" (incorrect, false, illusory).  But it makes littlesense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand, it isstrange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one cancertainly ask that question about motives.Therefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can't be considered:they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.Now the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled:  I agree withthe first part (that the "rightness" of a moral position is ameaningless question), for the reasons stated above.  But that isirrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) thatone cannot feel peace is better than war.  I certainly can makevalue judgments (bad, better, best) without asserting the "correctness"of the position.Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d).  My short (e) answer isthat when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue,neither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect).  They simply holddifferent moral values (feelings).-----------------------------------John A.

Frank, you are attempting to inject "goodness" judgements where thereare only "accuracy" judgements, by essentially punning on the word'value' which has both meanings. "useful" is a goodness judgement."Reasonable" is an accuracy judgement. They are not the samething at all. ("Useful in making some conclusion" is an accuracyjudgement again, I'm afraid.) Sorry, Frank, but all you're doing isusing the ambiguity of English to obfuscate the issue. IF youmean to say that science is based on value (accuracy) judgements,I have no problem with that. If you mean to say that it's basedon value (goodness) judgements, that's nonsense.

Why should I assert anything about beings that I don't believe in?When I have no good idea of what this being is like, only some contradictory statements being made by various religions, I cannot firmly assert anything specific. A mathematical atheist has a proof that no godlike beings can exist.However, we will first need a definition of 'god', and the theisticreligions do not agree very well on this. Did you see my earlierposting on the existence of god? Theists cannot even agree whetherany god exists, or meta-exists, or is herself the existence. Omnipotence, omnibenevolence and omniscience are other conceptstheists do not all agree upon. Thus, it is hard to assert anythingabout a such fluxional beings. _Deus absconditus_ remains hidden,from those who believe and from those who don't. > That's where weak atheism draws its strength.  But its> strength is also its Achilles' heel.  Without assertions/axioms, one> has no foundation upon which to build.  As a philosophy, it's virtually> worthless.  IMO, of course.I have to disagree here - first, philosophical maxims are not necessarilysomething to build upon. What can I build upon Occam's Razor, for instance? Weak atheism is not a _philosophy_ (a philosophical system).There are several alternatives from which atheists may choose from,ranging from reductionism (my choice) to objectivism. Actually,philosophy becomes simpler without the additional assumption of god/s.Second, your claim that being without assertions is an Achilles'heel of weak atheism sounds strange to me, and is actually a versionof the oft-heard theistic claim that 'but even atheists have to place theirfaith on _something_, even if it is not god_'. This has been discussed inthe FAQ, but from a different viewpoint, and I do not repeat it.I think one does not have to take _anything_ on blind faith.True, one cannot prove that reality exists independent of the observer;to assume this is not a blind leap of faith at all, however.

Why do atheists organize in groups?  What is there to discuss?Response:Many things are discussed here, including:* Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one's  family* Prayer in schools* Discrimination against atheists* Sunday trading laws* The Satanic Child Abuse myth* Whether one should be an overt atheist or 'stay in the closet'* How religious societies prey (sic) on new college students* How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers* Whether religion is a danger to society and/or the individual* Why people become atheistsOf course, inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical Christianslooking for someone to convert.  Most readers of the newsgroup don't want to be preached to, although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure from tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings.------------------------------Subject: Hitler was an atheist!Typical posting:Hitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!Response:Adolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist.  As he said himself:   The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in   his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_   superficially_of_God's_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God's_will,_and_   not_let_God's_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]   For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their   abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the   Lord's creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be   active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every   man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who   in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his   religious community and tries to butt into the other.   [...]   Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will   of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_   fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]          -- Adolf Hitler, from "Mein Kampf", trans. Ralph Mannheim.Of course, someone bad believing something does not make that beliefwrong.  It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed to believe in God.  We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist, though.------------------------------Subject: The Bible proves itTypical posting:In the Bible it says that...Response:Most of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionableaccuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who wererecording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn't to say that TheBible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before beingaccepted.Many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage issubject to "interpretation", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing andone thing only is not legitimate.Note that this feeling tends to extend to other books.It is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore otherequally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.------------------------------Subject: Pascal's WagerTypical posting:If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --but if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go tohell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.Response:This argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.Firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there aremany mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is oftendescribed as the "avoiding the wrong hell" problem.  If a person is afollower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.Secondly, the statement that "If you believe in God and turn out to beincorrect, you have lost nothing" is not true.  Suppose you're believing inthe wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine infavour of prayer.Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of comparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly theargument is only likely to convince those who believe already.Also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on evidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or cost-benefit analysis.Formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:  1. One does not know whether God exists.  2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does     exist.  3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.  4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.There are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as anassumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, inthe abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This isconsidered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has noinformation about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial informationcan be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violatesinformation entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, atno "cost".The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  Theproblem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states theChristian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. Theargument thus collapses to "If you are a Christian, it is in your intereststo believe in God" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascalintended the argument to be viewed.The biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God isomniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes asa wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at allwhether people believe in him.------------------------------Subject: What is Occam's Razor?Typical posting:People keep talking about Occam's Razor.  What is it?Response:William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's Razor.  In its original form, it said "Do not multiply entities unnecessarily."  That is, if you can explain something without supposingthe existence of some entity, then do so.Nowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor, they generally express it more generally, for example as "Take the simplest solution".The relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations for what we see around us:1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, whichcame into being as a result of natural processes.2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and there is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be of non-zero complexity.Given that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.Unfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:3. There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.  We just imagine that there is.This third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people find unacceptable. ------------------------------Subject: Why it's good to believe in JesusTypical posting:I want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.Response:Preaching is not appreciated.Feel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings thatare on a "conversion" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism andwill be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgrouptalk.religion.misc).You would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favouritenewsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you wouldhave them do unto you!Often theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthyanalogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know thebasic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tellatheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it,since it tells us nothing we have not been told before.------------------------------Subject: Why I know that God existsTypical posting:I *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.Response:Just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worshipexists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do notexist.  That evidence varies from person to person.Furthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, manypeople have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have beenabducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.------------------------------Subject: Einstein and "God does not play dice"Typical posting:Albert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you're cleverer than him?Response:Einstein did once comment that "God does not play dice [with the universe]". This quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in theChristian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein'srefusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore,Einstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.A better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following:"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony ofwhat exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions ofhuman beings."Einstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in anobjective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to randomevents and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed thatQM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need forstatistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found,and much evidence suggests that it never will be.A longer quote from Einstein appears in "Science, Philosophy, and Religion, ASymposium", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religionin Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  Init he says:  "The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events   the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side   of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him   neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an   independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a   personal God interfering with natural events could never be   *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this   doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific   knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.   But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives   of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine   which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,   will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm   to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers   of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal   God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past   placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they   will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable   of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity   itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably   more worthy task..."Einstein has also said:  "It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,   a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a   personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.   If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the   unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our   science can reveal it."The latter quote is from "Albert Einstein: The Human Side", edited by Helen Dukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.  Also from the same book:  "I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics   to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind    it."Of course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does not in itself imply that Christianity is false.------------------------------Subject: Everyone worships somethingTypical posting:Everyone worships something, whether it's money, power or God.Response:If that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much aboutthose things that atheists care about.  If the atheists' reactions to (forexample) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.------------------------------Subject: Why there must be a causeless causeTypical posting:Sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, sochains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.Response:The set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but hasno smallest member.Further, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that doesnot imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, andespecially not that any such entity must match the description favoured byany particular religion.------------------------------Subject: The universe is so complex it must have been designedTypical posting:The presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely youdon't think all this appeared here just by chance?Response:This is known as the Argument From Design.It is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in theuniverse. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of livingcreatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read thenewsgroup talk.origins for a while.There is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here.However, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour ofso-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence,observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of theuniverse and life on earth.The origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence ofsomething as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable thatsurely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaosdeliberately.But if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mindcapable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings mustbe immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of theexistence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationistposition.This leads us to the familiar theme of "If a creator created the universe,what created the creator?", but with the addition of spiralling improbability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was notcreated and just "is" (or "was").From here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universejust "is" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book"A Brief History of Time", explains his theory that the universe is closedand finite in extent, with no beginning or end.The Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called Watchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch onthe beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that itevolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the watch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the universe too must have a creator.The Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above those common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates watches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have created the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are clearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.Secondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in the world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear reactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument would therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a different part of creation.Finally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore stands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the argument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not random, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus internally inconsistent.------------------------------Subject: Independent evidence that the Bible is trueTypical posting:The events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentaryevidence.  For example...Response:The writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentaryevidence.Early versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus orJames; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Manyscholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, butthat this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several "reconstructions" ofthe original text have been published to this effect.Much information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320C.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberatefalsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'thefirst thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' It is Eusebius who isgenerally given the title of authorship for this material.Aside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus ismore well-documented.  For further information, please consult the FrequentlyAsked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.------------------------------Subject: Godel's Incompleteness TheoremTypical posting:Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for theBible to be both true and complete.Response:Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary arithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be valid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system.  (Technicallyspeaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decisionprocedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal system.)Essentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a "Liar Paradox."  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is "This sentence is false."  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.The logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claimsthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible toprove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.One can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove theexistence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom. This is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.It may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axiomsthat both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to showthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, thatwould still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God existswithin the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything aboutwhether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.Note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing aboutthe actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.Another frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstratesthat a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot beboth consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formalsystems, so such claims are nonsense.------------------------------Subject: George Bush on atheism and patriotismTypical posting:Did George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?Response:The following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I.Sherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Shermanis a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member ofthe press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announcefederal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to thepresidential primary: RS: "What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?" GB: "I guess I'm pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in      God is important to me." RS: "Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of      Americans who are atheists?" GB: "No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens,      nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under      God." RS: "Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation      of state and church?" GB: "Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I'm just not      very high on atheists."UPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations werestill angry over the remarks.The exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27,1989.  It can also be found in "Free Enquiry" magazine, Fall 1988 issue,Volume 8, Number 4, page 16.On October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane,cochairman of the Bush-Quayle '88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned alawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated SchoolDistrict 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son topledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as "one nation under God"(Bush's phrase).  The following conversation took place:  RS: "American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.      Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?"  EM: "It's bullshit."  RS: "What is bullshit?"  EM: "Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit."  RS: "Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush      campaign is on this issue." EM: "You're welcome."After Bush's election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retracthis statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to thePresident, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood byhis original statement, and wrote:  "As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports   atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or   supported by the government."For further information, contact American Atheist Veterans at the AmericanAtheist Press's Cameron Road address.------------------------------Subject: I know where hell is!Typical posting:I know where Hell is!  Hell is in Norway!Response:There are several towns called "Hell" in various countries around theworld, including Norway and the USA.  Whilst this information is mildlyamusing the first time one hears it, readers of alt.atheism are now getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.------------------------------Subject: Biblical contradictions wantedTypical posting:Does anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions?Response: American Atheist Press publish an atheist's handbook detailing Biblicalcontradictions. See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources fordetails.There is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from thearchive-server@mantis.co.uk. See the contacts file for more information.------------------------------Subject: The USA is a Christian nationTypical posting:Because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn't theUnited States be considered a Christian nation?Response:Based upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clearthat they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.  Here are somequotes; there are many more.  "What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?   In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the   ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen   upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been   the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert   the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient   auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it,   needs them not."      - James Madison, "A Memorial and Remonstrance", 1785  "I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of   the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved--the Cross.   Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!"      - John Adams, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson  "History I believe furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people   maintaining a free civil government.  This marks the lowest grade of   ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will   always avail themselves for their own purpose."      - Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt, 1813  "I cannot conceive otherwise than that He, the Infinite Father, expects or   requires no worship or praise from us, but that He is even infinitely   above it."      - Benjamin Franklin, from "Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion",        Nov. 20, 1728------------------------------Subject: The USA is not a Christian nationTypical posting:Is it true that George Washington said that the United States is not in anysense founded upon the Christian religion?Response:No.  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treatyof Tripoli (8 Stat 154, Treaty Series 358):   Article 11   As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense   founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of   enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, -- and as   the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility   against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no   pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption   of the harmony existing between the two countries.The text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collectionssuch as Charles Bevans' "Treaties and Other International Agreements of theUnited States of America 1776-1949", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).The English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate onJune 7, 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  It wasrecently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks thequotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.The person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, ConsulGeneral at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent ofChristianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since thereis no Arabic version of that article to be found, it's hard to say.In 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained thequotation.End of FAQ Digest*****************

King (king@ctron.com) posts a whopping one liner: * "The modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be * *  treated as a matter of faith." -- Francis Hitching                     *  I have a few points to make about the above posting.    1. Science is not based on and does not consist of "quotes" from either    real or alleged experts.  Critical reasoning, evidence and (if possible)    experimentation are necessary.  Creationists frequently display a massive    confusion about this by merely quoting both non-experts and experts alike    (some of the latter quotes are in fact false) and steadfastly refusing to    follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure.  This strongly suggests    that (a.) their claims completely lack any scientific merit and (b.) they    are aware of this fatal deficiency.  Of course, you may not actually be a    creationist and this may not be your real intent.    2. You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his    statement.  Why is that?  If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the    quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology.    Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context    and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate    scientists.  Of course, you may not actually be a creationist and this may    not be your real intent.    3. Evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of "the modern theory of    evolution" would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one    line quote from an unidentified nobody.  It is also important to note that    disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate    claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck    proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid.  Creationists seem rather fond    of diving (head first) into this logical fallacy.  Of course, you may not    actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent.    4. Since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science, an attack    on evolution (either the fact or the theory) really represents an attack on    science.  While the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve (B^) the    fact of evolution will not ever go away.  Creationists lost the battle long    ago (more than 100 years in fact) but are simply too willfully ignorant and    irrational to acknowledge the fact.  Of course, you may not actually be a    creationist and you may not really be that ignorant.Warren Kurt vonRoeschlaub (kv07@IASTATE.EDU) asks: * Neither I, nor Webster's has ever heard of Francis Hitchings.  Who is he? *  I, like Hitchings, am not to be found in Webster's B^).  Francis Hitchingsis a scientifically illiterate creationist (or perhaps he is just playing thepart of one) who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution ("The Neck ofthe Giraffe").  In that publication he quotes a creationist (Jean Sloat Morton)using the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins couldnot have formed by chance.  Thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution(the two are quite independent) but also concluding with a "non sequitur" (i.e.the conclusion "does not follow"). [pp 70-71]  Hitchings also misquotes RichardLewontin in an effort to support creationism. [pp 84]  Hitchings book was reviewed by National Park Service ecologist David Graberin the Los Angeles Times (and repeated in the Oregonian).  The article wastitled "`Giraffe' sticks scientific neck out too far".  Excerpts include :  "Francis Hitchings is not a biologist."  "He goes after Darwin like Mark  Antony after Brutus.  He flips from scientific reasoning to mysticism and  pseudo-science with the sinuosity of a snake-oil salesman."  "He suggests  a mystical `organizing principle' of life, using the similarity of organs  in different creatures as evidence [sic]."  Note that the last statement above is actually evidence FOR evolution notagainst it.  If John E. King is quoting from this reviewed book it wouldn'tsurprise me much.  It's also interesting that King had nothing to add (i.e.he only posted a quote).

How true. This claim wouldlend substantial support to the notion that religions are actuallyseamless virtual realities.Does god exist or not? To us, this question is a true dichotomy.Can god know a reason for her existence? If she is omniscient, thenshe must know this. There is a philosophical problem whether anythingcan exist without a time frame - for instance, if it were possible toobserve our universe from 'outside', in the neverness surroundingthis universe, it would never have existed. Thus, we are faced with a trilemma:1) God 'meta-exists', and from this meta-existing perspective shecreated existence, the Universe and everything. This implies that the universe was not actually formed of nothing, whichis precisely what many theories of cosmogenesis (Lizhi & Shuxian: Creation of the Universe) say. This 'nothingness' is not empty enough,it is not the transcendental nothingness where there is no existence,until (there is no 'when' yet, but never mind) god, the source ofall existence, started to play. I fail to see the difference betweenthese two forms of nothingness, though. If there isn't one, it mightbe god is not necessary for creation.It is obvious that the levels of 'meta-existence' are not necessarilylimited to god, there might be a 'meta-god' on some other level.2) God exists, and has always existed (she has a timescale, whichis different from our own). This sounds sensible, but it is difficultto conceive how she could know why she exists - a being whichhas always existed, and is infinitely conscious of itself, canremember that she has always been the same, and perhaps know herselfcompletely, but she cannot know why she exists, and how she knowseverything she knows. Would a knowledge of how a being with a personality (a subjective viewpoint) knows everything be thisbeing's knowledge? A conscious being conscious of everything isactually a contradiction in terms - it means that god is onlyconscious of herself, since we, and the whole universe, arealready incorporated in her mental models, thoroughly modelled.Actually, a conscious being conscious of only itself is notconscious at all. 3) God is herself the Existence. This is nothing more than an Orwellianredefinition of the word existence. A logical consequence of thisstatement is that god is actually _all_ existence. I think this isalso called a form of pantheism.: If this: being declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has: defined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed,: He is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically: self-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an: objective sense.In a reality god is supposed to have created, I cannot believe inher, is that my fault or the creator's fault? God gave me freedomof choice, but nevertheless knows what I will opt for, is it fairplay on her side?If god has a conscious mind, in any sense, she has a point of view.I'd say she is entitled to her opinions about me, but I still insistthat any harm she might attempt to do to me will be met with resistance and disapproval. : If God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective.No, an objective standard means something independent on _any_subjective viewpoint, _including_ god's point of view. : If human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that: standard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative: morality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous,: meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to: misunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to: meet that standard is therefore objectively determined.What standard? My morality (and my conscience)  disagrees with the'standards' of the Bible. Which one to ignore? How to interpretany divine standard? There is a great discrepancy even among Christians on this. For instance, the Bible does not condemnfemale homosexuality - why many Christians do, thinking god doesn'taccept it anyway?Bill, to reject a concept of any objective morality does not make theterm nebulous. Morality is the subjective aspect of societal behaviour,something we can change, and something that _must_ change whensocieties change. It might be some basic concepts are hard-wiredin our brains by evolution, but in the end, we must decide ourselves.I don't think people need religion to keep them moral; thinking goes beyond threat of punishment. : Just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is: infinitely malleable, doesn't mean that the objective standard itself: doesn't exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural: norm, or the preferred conduct of "decent" people, making it seem: subjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard.I've yet to see an objective standard that is a) universally applicable (today and tomorrow)b) universally acceptable (not against our own concepts of what ismoral and what isn't): Ironically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true: nature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being: contrary to human nre, oppressive and severe. This may be due as: much to our amoral inclinations as to the standard itself, but like it: or not, it's there.I don't think Christian morality is of a particularly high standard,although it is probably a reflection of high morals of the time,and much of it is still applicable. The problem is that I can'tagree with it all. This is not a question of comforting myconscience with a thought that "I won't be responsible with whatI do", as Christians would put it. My conscience is in an irreconcilableconflict with the Bible on homosexuality, Paul's idea of women'srole in marriage etc... and the whole idea that I should believein someone I got no help from in this task.Petri-- ___. .'*''.*        Petri Pihko    kem-pmp@          Mathematics is the Truth.!___.'* '.'*' ' .

In 1838, the governor of Missouri,governor Boggs, issued his so-called "Mormon extermination order."  Theonly crime ("illegal activity") the Latter-day Saints had committed, wastheir religious affiliation, their anti-slave stance (Missouri stillallowed slave practices), and their growing numbers/influence in Missouri.I guess the Mormons "got what they deserved," because they refused to bowto the will of (corrupt and evil) secular authorities. This "disobedience"brought upon them persecution, murder, and finally forced expulsion fromtheir lands and settlements...In the 1850s, the so-called "Utah-War" was forced upon the early Mormonsettlers, and their "illegal activities" consisted no less in living astheir conscience dictated, and to be sovereign/independant in Utah's(or "Deseret Territory" as it was called at the time) constitutionaldaily affairs.  (In order to subdue this clear threat to the survival ofthe United States of America, an entire army under the command of GeneralJohnson (hence "Johnson's Army"), invaded the territory to "restore"Uncle Sam's law and order...)History has the uncanny ability to draw certain parallels between eventsthat might appear unrelated, but are very much the same in spirit andintent.  That same mob- or persecution-prone attitude is to be found inthis user-group: when we tried to organize "soc.religion.mormon" and/or"talk.religion.mormon," a whole bunch of "charitable" believers effectivelyblocked our intent to create a group to discuss topics related to Mormonismet al in an appropriate forum.  We really must be a "threat" to variousestablishments...  Frustrating our legitimate rights for proper representa-tion also belongs in the category of persecution.  It is ironic that thosewho oppose us, point to all kinds of "justifications" to do so, despitetheir claims of adhering to a gospel of love...In any regard, Mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities (andI don't even discuss how Uthan's were suckered into allowing part of theirlands in becoming nerve-gas and atomic bomb testing grounds...) is far frombeing trusted or righteous.  Have things really changed for the better?  Imay be a born cynic, but I have NO reason whatsoever that such has been thecase. In the early 1980s, I believe, the late President Kimball (lds churchleader), strongly protested federal attempts to locate the MX-"Peace Keeper"missile maze from being built in Utah (yet another "inspired" decision fromsecular authorities).  Fortunately, his opposition was influential enoughfor the feds to back off.Lest anyone believe I do not believe in government: I do, but NOT withoutquestioning the wisdom and constitutionality of their decisions andresolves.  The government's actions around the Mt. Carmel compound in Wacowas NOT wise, neither was it necessary.  David Koresh did NOT pose a greatthreat to the federal authorities or the security of this nation, and withJohn, I too wonder who or what's next...#|> We used to live in a country where everyone enjoyed the free exercise#|> of their rights to worship and bear arms.  Now we don't.##Does that include the right to murder little children?  How about killing#ATF officers?  I do not know much about the gun laws in Texas, but#Koresh's folks claimed to have grenades, grenade launchers, and rocket#launchers.  I am not sure that the NRA feels that this falls under#"right to bear arms."Who killed who?  What constitutional right did the ATF officers have toinvade upon private land and to force themselves into the compound?What REALLY caused the "murder" of the little children?  Could it be thatthe ATF/FBI presence has any bearing upon the events?  How would youinterpret the Mt. Masada events?  --Blame the Jews?  (What the heck didthe Romans do there anyway?  What business did the ATF/FBI has in Waco,Texas???)  The Branch Davidians NEVER posed any threat to society.David Koresh, no doubt, will be described as the "evil" guy (by theexecutioners), while the actions of all those "valiant and brave" officersmay have been "regrettable," but alas, "necessary" to serve some dubiouspublic/national interest. --I guess they are still figuring it out how tosell this one to the nation...#|> Of course, to Jews and Mormons this is just a broken record.

The cult's leaders, who claim that God speaks to them, have told cult members to arm themselves in preparation for the end of the world, which they believe to me imminent. Weapons believed to be in their possession include large-bore military weapons as well as sporting arms.  A recent series in nearby newspapers has exposed the plans of the cult to take power throughout the region. Troops have surrounded the cult's "city" after incidents in which officials have exchanged shots with cult members.  There have been reports of children being seen in the cult compound, where discipline is said to be strictly administered. Governor Liliburn Boggs has issued an order that these "Mormons" are to be exterminated, or driven from the state..-----------------------------------------------------------------------And that's the news account, from 150 years ago..> |> We used to live in a country where everyone enjoyed the free exercise of> |> their rights to worship and bear arms.

No one has seen ANY evidence of the BD's having, much less using, such weaponry.

The "abuses" involved were non-mainstream religious beliefs, polygamy, child abuse, and fortification.  Soundfamiliar?  In my opinion, the BD's were as much a real threat to societyas the Mormons were then or are now.  (That is, until they were provoked.)By the way, I find your statement about "non-Nazi" law ironic.  Koresh was suspected of violating the Gun Control Act of 1968, which was BASED ON thetext of the Nazi Weapons Law of March 18, 1938.  ("Gun Control's Nazi Connection;" Jews for Preservation of Firearms Ownership, 2872 S. Wentworth Ave., Milwaukee, WI 53207, (414) 769-0760.)By the way, what was Koresh's specific violation?

I wrote that human brains "areinfested with sin", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.In reply, Mr Boundary wrote:> I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience> can be trusted virtually ALL the time.Which just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if yourconscience is properly formed?The only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging theformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be surethat your conscience is `properly formed' if you assume that your evaluationcan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I'llgrant, but it's not a valid way of reasoning.Unless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot becertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is`properly formed'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)Mr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:> Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the> infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          > Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.The Church is `by necessity' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?How do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument oranother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?You write:> Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our> competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our> ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas> not subject to the experimental method. But there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability todistinguish what is true from what is not true' and `infallible'.  I amconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long wayfrom `confident'.This discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain issignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say thatyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.Except in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutelycertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have anyidea of his own fallibility.I have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source oftruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All ofthem -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.The result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to theoriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original posterregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wronganswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternalconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he isat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this arefallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But thesebasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it'sunlikely that I'm misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level ofconfidence, I've tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully asto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven't, forexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,and I haven't attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have afeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant andintolerant even though I acknowledge that I'm fallible and so there'ssome chance I'm wrong.Don't get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogantChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at leastsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.If the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences forcertain decisions, it's not my fault -- I'm just telling it the way Ithink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up thatway.  It's one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it mostdifficult to respond to.  But it's not arrogance for me to tell whatI think is the truth.--clh]

I believe that this is not quite correct. My understanding is that LDS isengaged on a project to "convert" the souls of deceased persons of otherreligions, in order to spare them from damnation and gain them entrance intoheaven. To this end, the Church has compiled extensive genaeological records, sothat they will know the names of people to convert. A long article in the NewYorker a few years ago described the LDS research methods in some detail (forexample, some researchers pay visits to local native storytellers to learn thenames of people long dead). This sounds like just the sort of lie that would bemade up about any unusual religion, but the New Yorker story convinced me thatthere is some truth to it (the New Yorker used to do extensive fact-checking, andthe story was quite detailed).Ari

They still arm themselves to "defend thefaith", and stockpile food as well.  They have been involved in quite alot of illegal activity - including multiple (and often underage) wivesfor the leaders - a practice still in vogue with some splinters of theirsect.  The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking.So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J. Edgar Hoover was veryimpressed with the way they kept secrets.  (They're pledged to defendsecrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood.  Many actuallydo - even to the point of suicide.)  So he hired virtually no one butMormons, until the FBI was almost exclusively staffed by members of theChurch of Later Day Saints.  Though J. Edgar is finally gone, the FBIpersonnel (especially the field agents) are still heavily Mormon.I have often wondered how this might affect the FBI's treatmentof religious organizations a Mormon would consider heretical.-- ==========Michael McClarymcclary@netcom.comFor faster response, address electronic mail to:michael@node.com

(If they *understood*> some Wittgenstein, 98% would disappear. :-))" -- Michael L Siemon>Notice what I said about this book.  I called it "Easy reading."  The reason Idropped philosphy as my major was because I ran into too many pharisaicalSimon's.  I don't know how many walking encyclopedia's I ran across inphilosphy classes.  The problem isn't in knowing sooooo much more than youraverage lay person, the problem comes when you become puffed up about it. Schaeffer is just fine for the average lay person.  That was who he waswritting to.  I suppose that you would have criticised John that his gospel wasto simple.  I've talked with Schaeffer one on one.  I've been in lectures withthe man when he was being drilled by philosphy students and prof's from secularas well as Christian universities. (ND alone would fill both those catagories) His answers were enough that the prof's themselves often were taken back andcaused to re-think what their question was.  I saw this time and time again atdifferent open forums.  So yes, Schaeffers books are by in large, well,simplistic.  It certainly isn't grad level reading.  But we must get off ourhigh horses when it comes to recommended reading.  Do you seriously think mostpeople would get through the first chapter of Wittgenstein?  I may have more tosay about this secular scientist at another time.Also, one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by *insistent*inquisitiveness.  One cannot live his life constantly from a cartisian doubtbase.  Look, the Christian wholeheartedly supports genuine rationality.  But we mustadd a qualification to give this balance.  Christianity is second to none inkeeping reason in its place.  We never know the value of a thing until we knowits limits.  Put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaustit of all value!THis is why Xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic. It also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism, and not Christianfaith, which leads to irrationality.  If we forget the limits of a thing, wefly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironiclesson of life: "More without limits is less;  less with limits is more."  Or as I have so often stated it, freedom without form soon becomes form w/ofreedom.Let's put it another way.  The rationality of faith is implacably opposed toabsurdity but has no quarrel with mystery. Think about that.  It can tell thedifference between the two if you will let it.  Christianity's contention withrationalism is not that it has too much reason in it, but that it has verylittle else.  When a Christian comes to faith his understanding and his trustgo hand in hand, but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be calledto go on by itself without his understanding.This is where the principle of suspended judgment applies.  At such time if theChristian faith is to be itself and let God be God, it must suspend judgmentand say, "Father I do not understand you but I trust you."  Now don't read allyour objections of me into that statement.  I wasn't saying I do not understandyou at all, but I trust you anyway." It means that "I do not understand You *inthis situation* but I do understand *why I trust You* anyway"  Therefore I cantrust that you understand even though I do not. The former is a mysteryunrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity.  The latter isa statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery ofFaith.  So.... the principle of suspended judgment is not irrational.  It isnot a leap of faith but a walk of faith.  As believers we cannot always knowwhy, but we canalways know why we trust God who knows why and this makes allthe difference.Now, there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where I have partedcompany with philosophy- what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bitmore difficult in practice.  In practice the pressure of mystery acts on faithlike the insistent "whying" of a 3 year old.  It isn't just that we would liketo know what we do not know but that we feel we *must* know what we cannotknow.  The one produces frustration because curiosity is denied; the otherleads to genuine anguish.  More specifically the poorer our understanding is incoming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything aftercoming to faith.  If we do not know why we trust God, then we will always needto know exactly what God is doing in order to trust him.  Failing to graspthat, we may not be able to trust him, for anything we do not understand maycount decisevely against what we are able to trust.  If, on the other hand, we do know why we trust God, we will be able to trusthim in situations where we do not understand what He is doing. (Too many Xianleaders teach as if the Christian had a window in the back of his head whichallows for understanding at every foot fall)  For what God is doing may beambiguous, but it will not be inherently contradictory!  It may be mystery tous, but mystery is only inscrutable; what would be insufferable is absurdity.And that my friend, was the conclusion of Nietzche both in theory and inpractice.   --Rex

Then you can come home to something like this:    "Well, it's been a rough month," begins Johnnie Lawmaster.  "I just get laid off, and my divorce became final.  But I just wasn't ready for what happened this particular Monday."    That particular Monday was was December 16, the first day of the Bill of Rights' third century, the day when federal agents and local law enforcement officer broke into the house in Tulsa that always flew the U.S. flag.  When Lawmaster drove into the driveway that bleak afternoon, one of his neighbors had some news.    "'Ohmigod, John, you are in big trouble!' my neighbor tells me. 'Sixty police, federal agents and the bomb squad busted in you house, kicked down the door, cut locks off your gun safe.'  I couldn't believe it.  Then I walked inside.  What a nightmare."    It was no nightmare; it was horribly real life.  Apparently acting on information the Lawmaster possessed an illegal firearm, some thirty agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) teamed up with state and Tulsa police authorities, search warrant in hand, to search for a "Colt, AR-15, .223 caliber machine gun, unknown serial number."  The warrant, issued by U.S. Magistrate John Leo Wagner, also authorized agents to seize "any tools used in the alteration or modification of firearms, such as files or drills; documents, papers, books, records, and other tangible properties which identify occupants or owners of the property to be searched...."    Reports vary, but according to neighbors, the joint task force operation aimed at the unemployed warehouseman from a nearby hospital involved some 60 agents and local law enforcement personnel against Lawmaster.  They cordoned off the street; took station with weapons drawn in the back yard; used a battering ram to break through the front door; kicked in the back door; broke into his gun safe; threw personal papers around the house; spilled boxes of ammunition on the floor; broke into a small, locked box that contained precious coins; stood on a table to peer through the ceiling tiles, breaking the table in the process.  Then, they left.  The doors were closed but not latched, much less locked.  The ammo and guns were left unsecured.    "My front and back doors were pulled shut, but they were busted through and couldn't latch.  Anybody could have waltzed in there and stolen everything I own.  A child could have taken a gun.  The guns, the safe -- everything was open and laying around.  I keep all my magazines empty, but someone had loaded them.  While I was looking around in amazement, the gas, electric and water companies show up to turn the power off.  They said they were told to shut things down. Then I found the note.  "Nothing Found - ATF."    "They didn't make any attempt to notify me.  I've lived in Tulsa all my life and never got more than a traffic ticket.  How come they can't look that up, realize I've been law-abiding my whole life, then come to the door when I'm home?  They didn't leave someone here to watch over my private property.  They didn't even come by to explain what happened.  They just raided my home, ransaked it, left it wide open and left."    Lawmaster placed a phone call to the local BATF agent.  "I asked, 'Are you gonna' arrest me?' and he said, 'No.'  I asken him, "Who is going to repair and clean up my house?'  And he said, "If you're going to talk to me, come down to my office.'    "'I can't come down!' I said.  'My doors are broken!'  If I had been on vacation and I didn't have friendly neighbors, I would have lost everything I own.  Here I am a competent, responsible firearms owner, and the government leaves them open, unlocked, with ammo strewn around."    Lawmaster said the agent advised him, "If you want your door to lock and your gun safe to lock, you're gonna' have to pay for it yourself."    "'Oh, I'll come right down, alright,' I told him.  'I'll come down, but I'll bring my attorney.'  And he said, 'Well, you bring your attorney, and we won't talk to you.'"So if you don't want your tea party to be held in awkward silence, makesure your lawyer isn't there, there's a good chap.> It's very sad all those people died, especially the kids, but that's going> to happen in a free society whenever psychologically needy people hook up> with a charismatic nutcase.What a repulsive outlook on society.

Sure, there spirtual nature was depraved also, and like the othersins, the idolatry, the other sexual immoraity, and the other sinssprang from their depraved spiritual state which was a result of man's not glorifying God as God and being thankful.

Rom 1 is really about idolatry.  It refers to homosexuality>in passing.Is everything sinful specifically elaborated on in the New Testament?Scripture does not condemn being a drug dealer.  Being ruled by theSpirit rather than the letter not only frees from legalism, it alsoprotects us from sins that are against the Spirit.  The word is atwo edged sword that cuts both ways.  I think we must be careful before we totally throw out Leviticus.  If the Law is reflection of God's character and true holy nature, thenthose who say that God endorses homosexuality run into a problem.  If homosexuality were "natural" (whatever that means) wholesome, endorsed by God, and those who oppose sexual behavior are narrow-mindedbiggots, as some would have us believe, why is there a condemnation ofit in Leviticus.  This condemnation is in the midst of all the othersex sin condemnations, and there is nothing in the text to say that thislaw was limited to temple prostitution, and no good reason to believe thatthis was the case.  Furthermore, male homosexual sex was a death-penaltycrime!  Is every sin elaborated on in the New Testament?  Take a look atI Corinthians 5.  Paul said that one of the Corinthians had broken alaw not even heard of among the Gentiles, that one should have his father'swife.  There is a prohibition against having your father's wife in Leviticus.  No other new Testament verse clearly condemns it (besidesthis one.)  Notice that Paul did not say that the sin was in commitingadultery, etc.- he spoke against having one's father's wife.  Notice also that this sexual condemnation in Leviticus is not mentionedin the specific context of paganism either.  And there was no pagan coustom mentioned in I corinthians either.  As a matter of facttaking one's father's wife wasn't even done among the Gentiles.  It wasjust a plain blantant sin, whether worshipping idols was involved ornot.>One commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds>of questions we are trying to deal with.  He encountered homosexuality>only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was>wrong.  He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act>"straight" and fail, and he had never faced Christians who are trying>to define a Christian homosexuality, which fits with general Christian>ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the>relationship between God and man.  It is unfair to take Paul's>judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make>judgements on these questions.One of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argumentis because Paul probably did face this and other problems.  Sin canbe tough to over come, especially without supernatural power.  Ishomosexual sin any more difficult to overcome that heterosexual sin,like lusting after a married woman, or sleeping around with people ofthe opposite sex?  I doubt it, and even if it is, that is no excuse.God is greater than all of it. Another reason we reject it is because it ignores the supernaturalpower of God to intervene in this kind of situation.  How many people have been set free from sin by the power of God?  Sure theremay be any groups that have tried to change homosexuals and failed.That is a reflection on the people involved in the program, and notGod's willingness and ability to change a sinner.  Any program thatuses formulas may fail.  What people need is the power of God tochange them, whether they are involved in homosexual sin, or any othersin.>I claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is>not entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.  Paul's>tendency, as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating>holidays, is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues>to look very carefully at the good of the people involved, and to>avoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging.>For example, while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat>meat, he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about>which they had personal qualms. I don't see how you come to that conclusion.  Paul's dealings withpastorial issues encouraged people to give up their liberties in orderto spare others- not to allow people to continue in sin because itwas just too difficult.  Take the example of eating meat offered to idols.Paul felt that there was nothing wrong, in an abstract sense, witheating the meat.  Yet he advised believers to sacrifice their libertyto eat meat in order to spare others.  But Paul never allowed people to sin because living holy was just totough.  Paul wrote to "make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the luststhereof."  (Romans 13:14)  Then he goes in to a discourse on how weshould sacrifice our own liberty in order to spare the consciences of others.Suppose it were not a sin for people to practice homosexual acts.  Since others consider it to be a sin, then using Paul's approachon pastorial issues, those who would otherwise be homosexuals should sacrifice their liberty and be celbate or monogamously married to amember of the opposite sex.  Paul never offers a lesser sin (homosexual"marriage") to prevent people from engaging in what may be considered a more damaging sin.>For another example, Paul obviously>would have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances)>remain unmarried.  Yet if they were unable to do so, he certainly>would rather see them married than in a state where they might be>tempted to fornication.Yet marriage itself is not a sin.  marriage is holy in all- and somethingthat God ordains, and Paul recognizes this.> Note that in the>creation story work enters human life as a result of sin.

We all must be transformed by the renewing of ourminds- and that is the only way homosexuals can walk in freedom, justlike anyone else.>but I can well imagine Paul>preferring to see people in long-term, committed Christian>relationships than promiscuity.  As with work -- which Genesis>suggests wasn't part of God's original ideal either -- I think such>relationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing God's love>with each other.I'm sure you can see how people with the opposing view see this conclusion.  It's like saying, "How should I kill myself, with gun oraresenic?  What about the person who just is overcome with a desire tosleep with goats?  Would it be better for him to sleep with one goat,or all of them?  What about the person who wants to sleep with his aunts?Would it be better for him to sleep with one aunt or all of them?  In all these cases, the more people or animals one sleeps with, the higherthe chance that they will get a disease.  But this only deals with physical aspects of the question.  Whichever sin is commited, it all leads to spiritual death.>Cent. actions are the same.  When Christian homosexuals say that their>relationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paul>would have been familiar with, this is exactly the same kind of>argument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors.The issue that is most often addressed in Scripture seems to be theactual act.  Second, isn't it historical snobbery to say thatonly homosexuals of this century are capable of having "lovingrelationships?"  There are ancient writings glorifying homosexual "love."(btw, I am one who believes in refraining from making oathes.  Also,where do you get that tax collectors are sinners.  That's certainly notexplicit.  Jesus didn't tell Zachias to quit his job.)Link Hudson.[I'm reluctant to comment in this in detail.  Our basic concepts ofthe intention of Jesus and Paul are greatly different.  As I indicatedin the article, whatever the ambiguities of various words (and I stillthink they are significant), it does seem clear that Paul consideredthe homosexuality he saw around him wrong.  What you do with this factdepends upon your basic approach to the Bible.  I'm afraid thatcommunication between legalist and anti-legalist Christians is evenharder than between Protestants and Catholics in the 16th Cent.  Sinceyou disagree with my starting point, obviously you're going todisagree with all of the intermediate discussion and conclusions.Sometimes discussion is still useful.  I've seen some very interestingwork on Paul done by Jews.  Obviously they don't agree with him, butthey sometimes have helpful insight into what he meant.  But I don'tsee much sign for hope here.  In talk.religion.misc there's an axiomthat by the time Hitler's name is invoked, all hope for sensiblediscussion is gone.  On this subject, when sleeping with goats isinvoked, I don't think there's enough basis for understanding to beworth pursuing.  --clh]

In other>words technically speaking Christians should use Saturday and not Sunday>as their holy day, if they want to conform to the teachings of Jesus.I think the passage you're looking for is the following.Matthew 5:17    "Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them. Matthew 5:18   For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. Matthew 5:19   Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. Matthew 5:20   For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. There are several problems with this.  The most serious is that theLaw was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, butnot on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all humanbeings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  Theissue that the Church had to face after Jesus' death was what to doabout Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not toimpose the Law on them didn't say that the Law was abolished.  Itsimply acknowledged that fact that it didn't apply to Gentiles.  Thisis a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to.(A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recordedin Acts 15.)However there's more involved.  In order to get a full picture of therole of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul's apparentrejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus' commendation ofthe Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves apurpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, thisissue isn't one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of hisdiscussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, andassures us that that's not what he intends to say.  Rather, he seesthe Law as primarily being present to convict people of theirsinfulness.  But ultimately it's an impossible standard, and one thathas been superceded by Christ.  Paul's comments are not the world'sclearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But theinteresting thing to notice is that even this radical position doesnot entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as anuncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.For its purpose of convicting of sin, it's important that it not berelaxed.  However for Christians, it's not the end -- ultimately welive in faith, not Law.While the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in theend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  Thequoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the restof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets theLaw.  The "not an iota or dot" would suggest a rather literal reading,but in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretationsemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonialdetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitudetowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewishdiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving atenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things thatreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups andplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people whouse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, andthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specificview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining theLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.Paul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law beingsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the"ceremonial law", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quiteconcerned about maintaining moral standards.The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law beingsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believethey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul isembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in lettersresponding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of theLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewishceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standardsof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seemsto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals andhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were laterto give Paul so much trouble.It's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, butwe should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at theway terms like "family values" take on special meaning from thecurrent context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying tofigure out why "family values" should be used as a code word foropposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  Ithink Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul wasinvolved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish valuesthat go along with the term "Law", any more than people who concernedabout the "family values" movement are really opposed to familyvalues.

I know it is very contrary to theAmerican NRA ethos of the right to bear arms, but Christians should rely onthe strength of God to protect them.  Note that I say *should*.  We areinherently insecure but I feel that that is not proper justification to bearmed to the teeth.  A Christian should not have to rely on physical weaponsto defend himself.  A Christian should rely on his faith and intelligence.For instance, I have the faith that God will protect me but God also gaveme the intelligence to know not to go walking down that dark alley at night.To jump off a cliff and say that God will save me would be putting God to thetest.

Some underlying themes (morality, honesty, courage, respect, etc.) are used to base actions.  I don't consider the idea that we should have been moral, should be moral now, and should be so in the future a limitation, when it includes such morality.  Aberrances in a moral system, i.e. it is immoral to marrysomeone of the opposite sex, it is immoral to listen to rock and roll, etc. seem to be different than the above lists, and if specific actions are givenmoral status I tend to question those morals.MAC >-- >  Disclaimer?

Even if the readers have the slightest idea as to what thewriter is referring to, it should be incumbent on Mr. Erwin to back up whathe says with at least a concrete example of perhaps even a reference or two.(For example, "Simon Zealotes" = the certain apostle having a nicknameconnected to a Jewish terrorist group)Even Josephus fails to make the kind of broad brush reference toChristians made above - he is quite silent as to the fate of the JewishChristian Church in Jerusalem, even though he took the time torecord the death of St. James (brother of St. John). On the subject of thefate of Jesus's family, including James (the brother of Jesus) we learnnothing from Josephus.Likewise, Tacitus condemns the Jews as being a particularly vicious people, getting many of the facts about Jewish history wrong inthe process. But even though Tactitus undoubtedly had the opportunityto learn much about the Christians during his tour in Asia Minor underDomitian, we find little to enlighten ourselves about the Christiansin either the _Histories_ or the _Annals_The writer's interpretation of _Acts_ is purely subjective asstated, and so one might expect him to elaborate a bit on just what aspectsof "cult psychology" are to be found there.

The cult's leaders, who claim that God speaks to them, have told cult members to arm themselves in preparation for the end of the world, which they believe to me imminent. Weapons believed to be in their possession include large-bore military weapons as well as sporting arms.  A recent series in nearby newspapers has exposed the plans of the cult to take power throughout the region. Troops have surrounded the cult's "city" after incidents in which officials have exchanged shots with cult members.  There have been reports of children being seen in the cult compound, where discipline is said to be strictly administered. Governor Liliburn Boggs has issued an order that these "Mormons" are to be exterminated, or driven from the state..-----------------------------------------------------------------------And that's the news account, from 150 years ago..> |> We used to live in a country where everyone enjoyed the free exercise of> |> their rights to worship and bear arms.

The "abuses" involved were non-mainstream religious beliefs, polygamy, child abuse, and fortification.  Soundfamiliar?  In my opinion, the BD's were as much a real threat to societyas the Mormons were then or are now.  (That is, until they were provoked.)By the way, I find your statement about "non-Nazi" law ironic.  Koresh was suspected of violating the Gun Control Act of 1968, which was BASED ON thetext of the Nazi Weapons Law of March 18, 1938.  ("Gun Control's Nazi Connection;" Jews for Preservation of Firearms Ownership, 2872 S. Wentworth Ave., Milwaukee, WI 53207, (414) 769-0760.)By the way, what was Koresh's specific violation?

Why is someone elses will such a big deal if morality is all relative.I don't believe I ever said that morality was all relative.What I said was that I can make my mind up on my own, thank you, and that you don't have the right to tell others what to think.I think that you will find that in most moral systems, there is a respect for human life and the dignity of the person.  It is all thestuff besides these points that forms the core of the disagreement between primitive moral absolutists like yourself and the rest of us./(hudson)/Maybe (the insane lover of pain might reason) if other people experienced/enough pain, they might learn to enjoy it, too.  Fine.  There is still the clinical definition of crazy.

A much more likely explanationis the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, becausethe sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not thehistorical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitationimages of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk ofthe clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of coursenot.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether theanti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, orbecause it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.  The use of anti-Sunto represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented,but I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now.-- Diccon Frankborn (dickeney@access.digex.com)

Brian *IS* inside.  The Bible and the information contained thereinare outside the wall.   Brian Kendig proves this very sad fact by theabsurd things he says.  For example, "If I get through into the fireypit, I will cease to exist."  The Bible doesn't say that.  He hasn'ta clue even to what Jesus said about hell.  That is but one example.Now in your sense, Kent, of sensing reality--that is a differentmatter.  And to you and to Brian, relativity does play a big role.What we perceive to be true, depends on our vantage point.  Since Ihave read the Bible, and Brian Kendig shows that he hasn't, he has a narrower perspective than mine  (at least in the respectof knowledge of the Bible).   I am proposing to Brian, "Brian, come up hereand take a look from this vantage point."   But Brian replies, "I rathernot thank you.  I am content where I am.  Besides, the vista from upthere stinks."   And in the meanwhile, Brian ignores the facts thathe has never up there nor does he realize I had shared the sameplateau where Brian now stands.

Is the universe a closed or open system, and how could either be proven? If it isa closed system, have you been to the outside to look in?

Theonly crime ("illegal activity") the Latter-day Saints had committed, wastheir religious affiliation, their anti-slave stance (Missouri stillallowed slave practices), and their growing numbers/influence in Missouri.I guess the Mormons "got what they deserved," because they refused to bowto the will of (corrupt and evil) secular authorities. This "disobedience"brought upon them persecution, murder, and finally forced expulsion fromtheir lands and settlements...In the 1850s, the so-called "Utah-War" was forced upon the early Mormonsettlers, and their "illegal activities" consisted no less in living astheir conscience dictated, and to be sovereign/independant in Utah's(or "Deseret Territory" as it was called at the time) constitutionaldaily affairs.  (In order to subdue this clear threat to the survival ofthe United States of America, an entire army under the command of GeneralJohnson (hence "Johnson's Army"), invaded the territory to "restore"Uncle Sam's law and order...)History has the uncanny ability to draw certain parallels between eventsthat might appear unrelated, but are very much the same in spirit andintent.  That same mob- or persecution-prone attitude is to be found inthis user-group: when we tried to organize "soc.religion.mormon" and/or"talk.religion.mormon," a whole bunch of "charitable" believers effectivelyblocked our intent to create a group to discuss topics related to Mormonismet al in an appropriate forum.  We really must be a "threat" to variousestablishments...  Frustrating our legitimate rights for proper representa-tion also belongs in the category of persecution.  It is ironic that thosewho oppose us, point to all kinds of "justifications" to do so, despitetheir claims of adhering to a gospel of love...In any regard, Mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities (andI don't even discuss how Uthan's were suckered into allowing part of theirlands in becoming nerve-gas and atomic bomb testing grounds...) is far frombeing trusted or righteous.  Have things really changed for the better?  Imay be a born cynic, but I have NO reason whatsoever that such has been thecase. In the early 1980s, I believe, the late President Kimball (lds churchleader), strongly protested federal attempts to locate the MX-"Peace Keeper"missile maze from being built in Utah (yet another "inspired" decision fromsecular authorities).  Fortunately, his opposition was influential enoughfor the feds to back off.Lest anyone believe I do not believe in government: I do, but NOT withoutquestioning the wisdom and constitutionality of their decisions andresolves.  The government's actions around the Mt. Carmel compound in Wacowas NOT wise, neither was it necessary.  David Koresh did NOT pose a greatthreat to the federal authorities or the security of this nation, and withJohn, I too wonder who or what's next...#|> We used to live in a country where everyone enjoyed the free exercise#|> of their rights to worship and bear arms.  Now we don't.##Does that include the right to murder little children?  How about killing#ATF officers?  I do not know much about the gun laws in Texas, but#Koresh's folks claimed to have grenades, grenade launchers, and rocket#launchers.  I am not sure that the NRA feels that this falls under#"right to bear arms."Who killed who?  What constitutional right did the ATF officers have toinvade upon private land and to force themselves into the compound?What REALLY caused the "murder" of the little children?  Could it be thatthe ATF/FBI presence has any bearing upon the events?  How would youinterpret the Mt. Masada events?  --Blame the Jews?  (What the heck didthe Romans do there anyway?  What business did the ATF/FBI has in Waco,Texas???)  The Branch Davidians NEVER posed any threat to society.David Koresh, no doubt, will be described as the "evil" guy (by theexecutioners), while the actions of all those "valiant and brave" officersmay have been "regrettable," but alas, "necessary" to serve some dubiouspublic/national interest. --I guess they are still figuring it out how tosell this one to the nation...#|> Of course, to Jews and Mormons this is just a broken record.  It has#|> happened before.##Please explain.  I do not remember Jews or Mormons (as a group) overtly#breaking a judicious (a.k.a. non-Nazi) law and being punished for it.Read-Your-History.

The jealousy does not technically exist until the objectis apparent. However, the capacity to be jealous is presumably still thereeven though it is not detectable.Your description of the Unbilical took me three passes to understand (!) butI get the gist and I have to tentatively agree. I think our two definitionscan sit side by side without too much trouble, though. I haven't attempted todefine the reason behind the Moral Driver (only hinted through the essence ofeach Moral). Your definition hints that animals are also capable of asimilar morality - Simians have a similar Social Order to ourselves and it iseasy to anthropomorphize with these animals. Is this possible or have Imisunderstood?>>>>>If my suggestion holds true then this is the area where work must be>>>>carried out to prevent a moral deterioration of Society,>>>>What kind of work, exactly?>>>Well, here you have asked the BIG question.

I'd have been interested to hear it. >My p.s. thoughts falls roughly in line with John Stuart Mill andhis writings on Utilitarianism. I have no particular plan (except to domy bit - personal ethics AND social work). My opinion (for what it is worth)is that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that thiswill probably take several generations to be effective. I don't think that thelist of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority elementmay come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and histransactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is whatgives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.I've had some more thoughts on my definitions:I've was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitionsin order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay ofthe Moral Code and associated Authorities). A suitable analogy might be agraphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set offrequencies and the chosen 'amplitudes', and the Moral Character being thespectrum over time.Conscience is a little more difficult because I can't define it as thereasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Naturebecause Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and oftenunwanted. I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a giventime which compromises one's Moral Nature. My Conscience fits in more withFreud's SuperEgo (plus the Moral Driver) with the stimulous being theurges or Freud's Id. The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud's Ego,I suppose. If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason whyConscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. The question is "whatprovides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver?". I think I need somemore time with this one.That's about it for now!David.---On religion:"Oh, where is the sea?", the fishes cried,As they swam its clearness through.

There is an amount of give and take as in any relationship.Parents are supposed to be kind and loving but does that mean that children can do whatever they want?  NOT!  Part of being a parent meansadministering punishment when the child is at fault.  Part of being a parent means giving instruction.  God tests us through the trial oflife such that we may grow stronger.  He teaches what is right and what is wrong.  The consequences of our actions are made clear to us,be it Heaven or be it Hell.  If God did not follow through with whatHe has warned us about, He would not be a very good parent.In parenting, if a parent issues a warning but does not follow throughwith it, the children will not take that parent's words very seriously.God does the same by telling us who have ears to hear what to do andwhat not to do.

I'm not going to apologize for pointing outthat your straw-man argument was a straw-man argument.  Nor for sayingthat your list of "bible contradictions" shows such low standards ofscholarship that it should be an embarrassment to anti-inerrantists,just as Josh McDowell should be an embarrassment to the fundies.

Nor for callingyour red herrings and smoke screens what they are.I'm still not sure why you think I'm a hypocrite.  It's true that Ihaven't responded to any of Robert Weiss' articles, which may be due inpart to the fact that I almost never read his articles.  But I haveresponded to both you and Frank DeCenso (a fundie/inerrantist.)  Bothyou and Frank have taken quotes out of context, and I've objected toboth of you doing so.  I've criticized bad arguments both when theywere yours and I agreed with the conclusion (that the Bible is notinerrant), and when they were Frank's and I disagreed with theconclusion.  I've criticized both you and Frank for evading questions,and for trying to "explain me away" without addressing the objectionsI raise (you by accusing me of being hypocritical and irrational, Frankby accusing me of being motivated by a desire to attack the Bible.) Idon't see that any of this is hypocritical, nor do I apologize for it.I do apologize, however, for having offended you in any other way.Happy now?dj

No.  It follows from the fact that most Christians' choice ofinterpretation stems from a mix of beliefs that are influenced bythe secular ethics of their culture and that are not fullydetermined by scripture.  Whether or not there is some "right"interpretation matters not; few Christians claim the ability toread the mind of their god.  Dave Davis should note that it wasMichael who first stated the importance of secular and culturalinfluence in this thread.  I think Michael is right in this, butregardless, it should be noted that this has *not* been a pointof contention between Michael and myself. I have argued -- beyond Michael's claims -- that the Christianscriptures are open to so many interpretations -- including awide divergence within the Christian tradition -- that even theirmost important themes are vague.  Again, it does not matter thatthere is some "right" interpretation *unless* there is a way todetermine what that "right" interpretation is.  It is the lack ofan objective measure, not the presumed lack of an answer, thatputs the force behind the line I argue.> Michael, and I, and others, read 'the Bible' with Christian> glasses.

He is willing to live and practice his religionwithin this indeterminacy, and he is willing to acknowledge thatmuch of his understanding of things Christian is influenced byideas that are not purely Christian.  Those Christians I havecalled conservative must also interpret, but they do notrecognize -- or at least, are unwilling to admit -- the extent andimportance of this.> Russell Turpin (in an earlier post) had said that Michael (Michael's> theological positions, actually) didn't tell him much about Christianity;> Dean Simeon responds (this time gently): 'What do you mean?'

A surprising logical ellipsis.I think the conclusion does follow.  The purely Christianprinciples that Michael has are the ones he shares with others inthe Christian tradition or that can be derived from Christianscripture.  These, necessarily vague, are not enough to drive hispolitical stances.  That one should love one's neighbor is a purely Christian principle.  That this means showing tolerance for homosexuality is *not*.As to these political stances, they are often at odds with whatis commonly held in most of current Christendom, and so I suspect they could be better pressed outside it.  (On the otherhand, I can well understand the counterpoint, that these political stances become most influential when presented to those who need them most.)-*----> This is a theological statement worthy of Barth.> Dr Turpin (DD) may wear the black robe of Geneva yet! :-)Having barely survived the effort to finish in computer science, Idoubt I will attempt a more difficult field any time soon!Russell

"Love" is a highly ambiguous word, of which Christianscan write both the "gentle" words Paul uses of it in 1 Corinthians -- ina passage that even the "conservatives" will quote at you :-) -- and thewords of T. S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn, "Love is the unfamiliar Namethat wove the intolerable shirt of flame ..."This is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raisein my note, as will become more evident below.>As a non-believer, I find Michael's Christianity kinder and gentler.blechhh.  I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though,given my principle that one CANNOT force one's own notion of "sin" onanother, and my unshakeable "disestablishmentarianism", Russel Turpinand others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of mylegislating my own understanding of Christian love.>If I take him at>his word, he cannot condemn the Inquisitors, because they were>also following these commandments as *they* understood them.  IfYou misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill ofaccusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a formas anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to humanbeings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) "God"in near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:The "possibility that always exists" is that I (or, to revert to propertime sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) couldpersuade "Christian B" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeedconstitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also notethat the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christianargumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian]prohibitions.What Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:A.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved    in the Inquisition.B.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however    painful this *seems*, "discipline" her children for their    own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or    if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example    "deterring" others from the same loss-of-soul.)A.  I point out that this "justification" of a failure in love    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.B.  Burns me at the stake.My rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What isgoing on here has a *lot* to do with "cultural baggage."  In this case,the baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) beliefthat an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is mostbelievable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorialpractice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at leastgreatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussionof sin in the exchange between A and B.Mr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor's B,then my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what-ever personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defenseattorney.  So, "one possibility" fails in this case -- as it will fail inmay others.  At the other extreme, the "persuasion" will succeed when itproperly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with theInquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in thatmany of the victims of Inquisition will have "accepted" that they were infact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guiltyof charges brought against them.)The point is that the "persuasion" breaks down when the parties do NOTshare enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the mainthrust of the Inquisition, against "heresy", it is *bound* to break downin precisely the "worst" cases.  The "conservative" (I don't think thatis the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above,that he is "justified" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works toa "greater good."  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to followthe gospel, as if one's theories about "sin" entitled one to cast asideJesus' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).I am a "radical" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.>(Or, for that matter, what does it mean to love one's fellow>man?) And what is the "right thing"?  And how does one go about>loving god? Well, the whole *point* of making these the "base" commandments is thatthey *aren't* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or alaw code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpfulto individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of apersonal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions.  The GreatCommandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you wereGod and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  Ademand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps poppingup nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more importantthat I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  "Conservatives"may twist this "act as if you were God" to mean "lay down rules for otherpeople and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep YOUR rules."They are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced alot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocyIS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation "againstGod" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the "conservatives" haveconfused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing otherpeople with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standardAmerican atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.>Ethical systems are not differentiated by the nice sounding goo>up front, much of which sounds pretty much the same, but by the>*specific* acts, procedures, and arguments that they recommend.And different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged*different* "ethical systems" (or in some cases, none).  As a result,it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular(or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH.It does not have a QU'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has verylittle, if anything, in the way of "commandments" -- so little thatthe "Christians" who desperately *want* commandments go "mining" forthem with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-))for their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesusspecifically "gives" as "a commandment" to us is "love one another."[I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I'll point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why there is a huge amount of "cultural baggage" involved.]You are quite right that this is "goo" if one is looking for an ethicalsystem.But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since oursociety is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  Itmay be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems-- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.>I am glad that a few Christians,>such as Michael, find a benign meaning for the goo, and then>interpret the usually ugly specifics in a more constructive>fashion.  On the other hand, I do think that this tells us more>about Michael and Christians like him that it tells us about>Christianity. I think you are begging the question. Why don't I and the (myriadsof) other Christians like me tell you something about Christianity?[Nor is this very new in Christianity -- you might want to look upthe origins and fundamental doctrines of the Quakers, from the 17thcentury onwards, and they are not at all the first to understand thegospel in a manner that is congenial to my case.]-- Michael L.

He is the Prophet who is revealedthe last Holy Scripture, Qur'an, by Allah SWA (all praise be to Him)through the Arch Angel Gabriel.  He is the seal of all prophetstill the day of judgement as stated in the Qur'an by AllahSWA (all praise be to Him).  Muhammad SAW lived between571-632 AC.  All other prophethoods claimed after Muhammad SAW,is a treason against Islam, against Qur'an, against the messageof Allah SWA.  Muhammad SAW is from the seed of Ishmael, anothermessenger of Allah and son of Abraham also a messenger of Allah.He is the Messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold hiscoming.  The above mentioned verse from the Qur'an is from Chapter 33, Verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows:Muhammad is not the father of any of your men,but (he is) the messenger of Allah, and the sealof the prophets, and Allah has full knowledge ofall things.---------------------Commentary on the above verse:  When a document is sealed,it is complete, and there can be no further addition.  The Holy Prophet Muhammad SAW closed the long line of Messengers.Allah's teaching is and will always be continuous, but therehas been and will be NO Prophet after Muhammad SAW.  The laterages will want thinkers, and revivers, not Prophets.  This is notan arbitrary matter.  It is a decree full of knowledge and wisdom,"for Allah has full knowledge of all things."----------------------DROPLET VOL 1, No 11, Part 2A   D R O P L E TFrom The Vast Ocean Of The Miraculous Qur'anTranslations from the Arabic and Turkish Writings of Bediuzzaman Said Nursi, The Risale-i NoorVOL 1, No 11, Part 2------------------------------------------------------------------    NINETEENTH LETTER   MU'JIZAT-I AHMEDIYE RISALESI (A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED SAW)       (continued from Droplet Vol 1, No 11, Part 1)   SECOND  SIGN:   The  Noble  Messenger  (SAW)declared His prophethood, and presented to humanity adecree as the Glorious Qur'an and manifest miracleswhich number, according to the scholars, one thousand.The occurrence of those miracles in their entirety is ascertain as the fact that He declared himself prophet.  Infact, as a shown by the words of the  most obstinateunbelievers quoted in various places of the WiseOur'an, even they could not deny the occurrence of Hismiracles, but only called them -hasha wa kella!-(Allah forbids) sorcery, in order to satisfy themselves, or to deceive theirfollowers.  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW) have thecertainty of confirmation by consensus of Ulema (scholarsof Islam) to the hundreth degree.   The Miracle is the conformation by the CREATOR ofthe universe of His declaration of Prophethood; it has theeffect of the words,'You have indeed spoken the truth !'   Suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler,while being observed by Him, 'The true ruler hasappointed me to such and such position.  'At a time whenyou were asked to prove your claim, the word 'Yes'uttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you.  Or, ifthe ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at yourrequest, this would confirm your claim even more soundlyand more definitely than would the word 'Yes.'   In the same way, ALLAH's Most Noble Messengerclaimed: 'I am the envoy of the CREATOR of thisuniverse.  My proof is that He will change His unbrokenorder at my request and my prayer.  Now look at myfingers:  He makes them run like a fountain with fivespigots.  Look at the moon: by a gesture of my finger, Hesplits it in two.  Look at that tree: to affirm me, and to bearwitness to me, it moves and comes near to me.  Look atthis food: although it is barely enough for two or threemen, it satisfies two or three hundred.  'Further he showshundreds of similar miracles.  However, the evidences  ofthe veracity of this high being and the proofs of hisprophethood are not restricted to his miracles.  All hisdeeds and acts, his words and behavior, his moralconduct and manners, his character and appearanceprove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness.Indeed, many people  such  as  Abdullah  b. Salam,  thefamous scholar of the Children of Israel, came to beliefmerely by seeing him, and said, 'No lie can hide in thisface, nor can any fraud be found in it!'   Although many of the  researchers have concludedthat the proofs of the prophethood of Muhammad and hismiracles number about one thousand, there arethousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  ofhis prophethood.  And hundreds of thousands oftruth-seeking men (muhakkikiin) with varying opinionshave affirmed his prophethood in an equal number ofways.   The Wise Our'an alone demonstrates thousands ofthe proofs of his prophethood, in addition to its own fortyaspects of miraculousness.  Since prophethood is as aphenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thousands ofindividuals who claimed prophethood and performedmiracles have lived and passed away; then, theprophethood of Muhammad (SAW) is of a certanitysuperior to that of the prophethood of all the others.  Forwhatever evidences, qualities  and attributes  became themeans of the prophethood and messengership of all themessengers such as Jesus (AS) and Moses (AS), theyare all owned in a more perfect and comprehensivefashion by Muhammad (SAW).  And since the causes andmeans of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in theperson of Muhammad (SAW), this authority is to be foundin him with more certanity than all the other prophets.-----------------------------------------------------------------To be Continued Allah Willing.Irfan Alan, A Servant of Islam.

How about these two:1.  Some of the survivors claimed that BD members poured fuel along thecorridors and set fire to it.  The speed at which the fire spreadis not inconsistent with this claim.2.  There was certainly a fire which killed most of the people in the compound.There is a very very good possibility that the FBI did not start thisfire.  This is a good reason to believe that the BD's did.3.  Even if the BD's were not contemplating suicide, it is very possible thatDavid Koresh was convinced (and thus convinced the others) that thiswas not suicide.  It was the fulfilment of a profecy of some sort.There are three possibilities other than the BD's self destruction:A.  They are not dead, but escaped via bunker,etc.  From reports of theinadequacies of the tunnels and the bodies found, I would rate thisas highly unlikely.B.  The fire was started by an FBI accident.  This is possible, but it would befoolish of us to declare this outright until more evidence can back it.Sure, it's possible that the armored vehicle knocked down a lanternwhich started the fire (why was there a lit lantern in the middle ofthe day near the edge of the complex?).  It's anecdotal evidence thathas been contradicted by other escapees.C.  The fire was started on purpose by the FBI.  This has been suggested bysome on the NET, and I would rate this possibility as utterlyludicrous.  This is what we in "sci.skeptic" would call an"extraordinary claim" and won't bother refuting unless someone givesany good evidence to back it up.So we are left with two reasonable possibilities.  That the fire was an FBIaccident and that the fire was started by the BD.  I find the latter morelikely based on the evidence I've seen so far.-- *Isaac Kuo (isaackuo@math.berkeley.edu)*       ___** _____/_o_\\_____*Twinkle, twinkle, little .sig,*(==(/_______\\)==)*Keep it less than 5 lines big.* \\==\\/     \\/==/

I never said that the Law was made: obsolete by Jesus.Just for reference, here's the earlier quote:Malcolm Lee (mlee@post.RoyalRoads.ca) wrote in reference to Leviticus 21:9and Deuteronomy 22:20-25:: These laws written for the Israelites, God's chosen people whom God had: expressly set apart from the rest of the world.  The Israelites were a: direct witness to God's existence.  To disobey God after KNOWing that God: is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately: punishable.: Remember, these laws were written for a different time and applied only to: God's chosen people.  But Jesus has changed all of that.  We are living in: the age of grace.  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death.  There: is repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.  And: not just for a few chosen people.  Salvation is available to everyone, Jew: and Gentile alike.These are two conflicting statements.  To say one is a clarification of theother is a breach of logic.  I don't mind people shifting their position onan issue.  It irritates me when it is said under the premise that no changewas made.  What about Deuteronomy 22:20-25?  Is it wrong now?  Did Jesuschange that?: If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the: following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon: the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.Sure he does this.  However, he doesn't address the notion of stoningnon-virgin brides, because this needs no clarification.  Are you going todeny that Deuteronomy 22:20-25 is not patently clear in its intent?: I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of: modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe: in it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?I'll agree that there is a lot of modern day Pharisees that know the Biblefrom end to end and don't believe in it.  Depending on how they use thisknowledge, they can be scary.  They can argue any position they desire, andback it up with selected parts of the Bible.  Such Pharisees include DavidKoresh and Adolph Hitler.  I will qualify this by saying *I don't know* ifthey actually believed what they were preaching, but the ends certainlymade the means look frightening.However, just as scary are those that don't know much of the Bible, butbelieve every word.  In fact, this is probably scarier, since there are farmore of these people, from what I've seen.  In addition, they are very easyto manipulate by the aforementioned Pharisees, since they don't know enoughto debate with these people.: Christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's: perspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will.No, it demands obedience to a book.  If God came down and personally toldme how I should behave, then I would say that I would be doing God's willby doing it.  However, if preachers, pastors, and evangelists tell me toobey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close totwo millenia (even longer for the OT), even if I follow everything in itwith my heart, I could scarcely be honest with myself by saying I'm doingthe will of God.: Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is: their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.Well, if God respects it so much, how come there is talk in the Bible abouteternal damnation for non-believers?

I purposely used "handle" in order to avoid doing so - i.e., that happens to be what religions do (of course there areaberrations like "scientific" creationism).  I used "best" in part to indicate that science currently has a time of it with why and who, so these domains aremostly ignored.  I also attempted to be brief, which no doubt confused thematter.  As an aside, for science I should have written "how and when".  Nobodyseems to argue over what.>Are they [theists, theologians] any better equiped to investigate the "who and >why" than magicians, astrologers, housewives [not being sexists], athiests or >agnostics.Seems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual.  I'm nottrying to be evasive on this, but from a societal perspective, religion works.On the other hand, sometimes it is abused and misused, and many suffer, whichyou know.  But the net result seems positive, this from the anthropologicalperspective on human affairs.  You might call me a neo-Fruedian insofar as I think the masses can't get along without religion.  Not that generally they are incapable; they just don't, and for myriad reasons, but the main one seems to be the promise of immortality.  Very seductive, that immortality.  Therefore it seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for dispensing answers to "who and why".  I suggest that this holds regardless of the "truth" in their answers to who and why simply because people believe.  In the end, spiritual beliefs are just as "real" as scientific facts and explanation (CAUTION TO SOME: DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT).  >Do you suggest that the "who and why" will forever be closed to scientific >investigation?No.  In fact, I don't think it is closed now, at least for some individuals. Isn't there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was created from nothing in a Big Bang singularity?  This approach might presuppose an absence of who and why, except that it seems it could be argued that something had to be responsible for nothing?  Maybe that something doesn'thave to be supernatural, maybe just mechanistic.  But that's a tough one forpeople today to grasp.  In any case, theory without empirical data is not explanation, but then your question does not require data.  In other words, I agree that theorizing (within scientific parameters) is just as scientific as explaining.  So the answer is, who and why are not closed to scientists, but I sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate.  Data will be necessary for improvement, and that seems a long way off, if ever.  Pretty convoluted here; I hope I've made sense.  >It seems to me that 200 or so years ago, the question of the origin of life on>earth was not considered open to scientific enquiry.I agree generally.  But I prefer to put it this way - the *questions* of how, when, who and why were not open to inquiry.  During the Enlightenment, reason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when, and not, for the most part, who and why.  Science was thus born out of the naturalists' curiosity, eventually carting away the how and when while largely leaving behind the who and why.  The ignorant, the selfish, the intolerant, andthe arrogant, of course, still claim authority in all four domains.>|>Rich Fox, Anthro, Usouthdakota>Did like your discussion around AMHs, and I did figure out what AMH was from>your original post :-)Much obliged.  Funny how facts tend to muddle things, isn't it?

If anything, one could claim that,in a sense, Daniel is a descendant of Zoroaster; as Daniel, though beingHebrew, has assimilated into Zoroastrianism and has successfullyintroduced the religion into the Tanakh of Judaism. [However, the majority of the book is in Hellenistic Aramaic (not Babylonian Aramaic) and only hasKethuvim or Writing status.]Ref: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade:DANIEL, or, in Hebrew, Daniyye'l; hero of the biblical book that bears his name.Daniel is presented as a Jew in the Babylonian exile who achieved notoriety inthe royal court for his dream interpretations and cryptography and for hissalvation from death in a lion's pit. He also appears in the last chapters ofthe book as the revealer of divine mysteries and of the timetables of Israel'srestoration to national-religious autonomy. As a practitioner of oneiromancy inthe court, described in Daniel 1-6 (written in the third person), Daniel per-forms his interpretations alone, while as a visionary-apocalyptist, in Daniel7-12 (written in the first person), he is in need of an angel to help himdecode his visions and mysteries of the future. It is likely that the nameDaniel is pseudonymous, a deliberate allusion to a wise and righteous man knownfrom Ugaritic legend and earlier biblical tradition. (Ez. 14:4,28:3).  The authorship of the book is complicated not only by the diverse narrativevoices and content but by its language: Daniel 1:1-2:4a and 8-12 are written inHebrew, whereas Daniel 2:4b-7:28 is in Aramaic. The language division parallelsthe subject division (Daniel 1-6 concerns legends and dream interpretations;7-12 concerns apocalyptic visions and interpretations of older prophecies). Theoverall chronological scheme as well as internal thematic balances (Daniel 2-7is chiliastically related) suggest an attempt at redactional unity. After theprefatory tale emphasizing the life in court and the loyalty of Daniel and someyouths to their ancestral religion, a chronological ordering is discernable: asequence from King Nebuchadrezzar to Darius is reported (Dn. 7-12). Much ofthis royal dating and even some of the tales are problematic: for example,Daniel 4 speaks of Nebuchadrezzar's transformation into a beast, a story thatis reported in the Qumran scrolls of Nabonidus; Belshazzar is portrayed as thelast king of Babylon, although he was never king; and Darius is called a Medewho conquered Babylon and is placed before Cyrus II of Persia, although no suchDarius is known (the Medes followed the Persians, and Darius is the name ofseveral Persian kings). Presumably the episodes of Daniel 2-6, depicting aseries of monarchical reversals, episodes of ritual observances, and reports ofmiraculous deliverances were collected in the Seleucid period (late fourth tomid-second century BCE) in order to reinvigorate waning Jewish hopes in divineprovidence and encourage steadfast faith.  The visions of Daniel 7-12, reporting events from the reign of Belshazzar tothat of Cyrus II (but actually predicting the overthrow of Seleucid rule inPalestine), were collected and published during the reign of Antiochus IV priorto the Maccabean Revolt, for it was then (beginning in 168 BCE) that the Jewswere put to the test concerning their allegiance to Judaism and their ancestraltraditions, and many refused to desecrate the statues of Moses and endured amartyr's death for their resolute trust in divine dominion. All of the visionsof Daniel dramatize this dominion in different ways: for example, via images ofthe enthronement of a God of judgment, with a "son of man" invested with rule(this figure was interpreted by Jews as Michael the archangel and by Christiansas Christ), in chapter 7; via zodiacal images of cosmic beasts with bizarremanifestations, as in chapter 8; or via complex reinterpretations of ancientprophecies, especially those of Jeremiah 25:9-11, as found in Daniel 9-12.  The imagery of the four beasts in chapter 7 (paralleled by the image of fourmetals in chapter 2), representing four kingdoms to be overthrown by a fifthmonarchy of divine origin, is one of the enduring images of the book; it sur-vived as a prototype of Jewish and Christian historical and apocalyptic schemesto the end of the Middle Ages. The role and power of this imagery in thefifteenth and sixteenth century work of the exegete Isaac Abravanel, thescientist Isaac Newton, and the philosopher Jean Bodin and among the FifthMonarchy Men of seventeenth century England, for example, is abiding testimonyto the use of this ancient topos in organizing the chiliastic imagination ofdiverse thinkers and groups. The schema is still used to this day by variousgroups predicting the apocalyptic advent.  The encouragement in the face of religious persecution that is found andpropagandized in Daniel 11-12 contains a remarkable reinterpretation of Isaiah52:13-53:12, regarding the suffering servant of God not as all Israel but asthe select faithful. Neither the opening stories about Daniel and the youths northe final martyrological allusions advocate violence or revolt; they ratheradvocate a stance of piety, civil disobedience, and trustful resignation.Victory for the faithful is in the hands of the archangel Michael, and themartyrs will be resurrected and granted astral immortality. Persumably thecircles behind the book were not the same as the Maccabean fighters and mayreflect some proto-Pharisaic group of hasidim, or pietists. The themes ofresistance to oppression, freedom of worship, preservation of monotheisticintegrity, the overthrow of historical dominions, and the acknowledgement ofthe God of heaven recur throughout the book and have served as a token oftrust for the faithful in their darkest hour.ZARATHUSHTRA, founder of the religion know as Zoroastrianism or Mazdaism (fromMazda or Ahura Mazda, the name of the god prophesied by Zarathushtra.) Theetymology and history of Zarathushtra, the Avestan and oldest form of the name,as uncertain, both in various Iranian languages and in related forms else-where. There may have been an Old Persian form, Zara-ushtra, from which theGreek form, Zoroastres, may be derived, and there may have existed an OldIranian form, Zarat-ushtra, to which may be linked the Middle Iranian Zrdrwsht,several Middle Persian forms (such as Zrtwsht), and the New Persian Zardusht.We can state with certainty only that the second half of the name, ushtra,means "camel." The form Zoroaster, derived from the Greek Zoroastres, was usedtraditionally in European culture until the eighteenth century, whenZarathustra, closer to the original (and as found in Nietzsche), came intocommon use after the rediscovery of the Avesta, the collection of sacred booksof Zoroastrianism, and the resulting studies in Iranian philology. [See Avesta.]  Notwithstanding the great and continued popularity of Zarathushtra, even inWestern culture, the sources available to us are few, extremely fragmented,and heterogeneous. Our principle sources are the five Gathas ("songs"),attributed to Zarathushtra himself and included in the Yasna section of theAvesta: Gatha Ahunavaiti (Yasna 28-34), Gatha Ushtavaiti (Yasna 43-46), GathaSpentamainyu (Yasna 47-50), Gatha Vokukhshathra (Yasna 51), and GathaVashishtoishti (Yasna 53), the last of which was probably written after theprophet's death.  Other sources of considerable, albeit varying, importance are the YoungerAvesta and the remaining Zoroastrian religious literature, in particular thePahlavi texts of the ninth and tenth centures CE. Although the Achaemenidinscriptions (sixth to fourth centures BCE) never mention Zarathushtra, he ismentioned by some Greek sources of the time (not, however, by Herodotus, whoseems unaware of him).  The Avesta does not provide any direct or explicit data concerning the truechronological history of Zarathushtra. But the text is useful in an indirectway, as it clearly implies that the environment in which Zoroastrianism arosewas not that of Iran under the Medes or the Persians. The Greek sources, on theother hand, do provide some information concerning the time of Zarathushtra,although from a historical point of view they are unreliable. Some place himsix thousand years before the Trojan War (Xanthus of Lydia, Eudoxus of Cnidus,Hermippus, Hermodorus, Aristotle, Plutarch, Diogenes Laertius, and Pliny). Theaccount by Xanthus of Lydia, however, has also been interpreted by some to meansix hundred, rather than six thousand, years before the expedition of Xerxesagainst Greece. This interpretation is favored by Diogenes Laertius, who makesreference to Xanthus, but although a few scholars (A. S. Shabazi, HelmutHumbach) have recently attempted to rehabilitate it under various pretexts, itis generally rejected.  Although the historical value of the Greek sources is negligible, they arenonetheless important in that they show that the millenarian doctrine of historyof the cosmos had already been developed in Iran by the Achaemenid period, asthe above account would seem to demonstrate. They also show that by this timeZarathushtra was already seen as an almost mythical figure, one from anextremely distant past. All of this leads to the conclusion that the prophetcould not have belonged to a historical period contemporary with, or even closeto, that of the Achaemenids.  Later Zoroastrian sources, the Pahlavi texts, do provide an absolute chrono-logy for Zarathushtra, one that was also accepted by some Arab authors. Accord-ing to these sources, Zarathushtra lived 300 or 258 years before Alexander.Again, scholars are divided on the validity of the chronology; some view it ashistorically reliable while others believe that it is devoid of historicaljustification. The most convincing arguments, however, seem to support thelatter position. The figure of 258 years is accurate only on the surfacebecause it represents, in fact, the more general one of 300, which was employedby Sasanid propagandists to locate Zarathushtra's lifetime roughly around thebeginning of Iranian domination. For a number of reasons connected with complexproblems inherent in the Iranian chronology, there was also a desire on thepart of the Sasanid propagandists to avoid any millenarian threat. In thiscontext, Zarathushtra, whom tradition places early in the ninth millennium afterthe beginning of the cosmos, converted Vishtaspa at the age of forty-two, andVishtaspa's conversion was viewed by some as the beginning of the millennium(thus explaining the double date of 300 and 258 years before Alexander).  Given the unreliability of the few available sources, we are forced toreconstruct an absolute chronology on the basis of other elements, principallyon the contention that Zarathushtra must have lived a few centuries before Cyrusthe Great, Cambyses, and Darius, as there is no mention in the Avesta of thegreat political achievements that took place in western Iran in the middle ofthe first millennium BCE. Nor is there any mention of the history of thatperiod, which was to lead Iran to a position of such predominance. At the sametime, for a number of reasons, going back much further in history would not bejustified. Consequently, the traditionally accepted theory of placing Zara-thushtra around the beginning of the first millennium BCE appears to be themost legitimate.  As to Zarathushtra's land of origin, many scholars agree, on the basis ofvalid arguments, that he must have come from eastern Iran. Some have held thathe was a Mede, largely because of a late Iranian tradition linking Zarathushtrawith Azerbaijan, but also because of linguistic reasons, based on the languageof the Avesta. This hypothesis, however, should be discarded, as we can suppose,both on historical and linguistic grounds, that Zarathushtra came from the east,even though we do not know precisely from which region. There is a considerablevariety of opinion on this particular matter, including the improbable viewthat he came from Chorasmia, or present-day Khorezm, or from a wider Chorasmianregion, reaching as far as the oases of Merv and Herat. Most likely, however,Zarathushtra's land of origin is somewhere in the vast area stretching from theHindu Kush mountain range to the more southern regions of Bactria and Arachosia(modern Qandahar), as well as Drangiana (the area of lake Helmand). It wouldthus be located in what is now Afghanistan or in the border regions of Iran.  Zarathushtra himself tells us that he belonged to the priestly caste (Yasna33.6). He was a zaotar (cf. Sanskrit hotr), that is, a priest belonging to aspecific group connected with a school that produced very elaborate and learnedreligious poetry. Even in the so-called Younger Avesta he is described as anathravan (Yashts 13.94), a more general term encompassing the entire priestlycaste. To enter it he had undergone a long and rigid training, which he usedto lend dignity (as in the Gathas) to the contents of his new message, theproduct of a great and original ethical mind.  Zarathushtra also belongs to that venerable priestly tradition, linking Indiato Iran in another way, by centering his teachings on the praise of the ashavan,or "possessor of asha," that is, the one who, as in the Vedic rtavan, seekstruth and masters it, thus becoming ashavan in this life - almost an initiate -and blessed after death. Any good follower of such teachings seeks the "visionof asha," just as those chosing the right path in Vedic India aspired to the"vision of the Sun," a manifestation of rta. Behind these concepts and thislanguage lies the great tradition of "Aryan mysticism," that is, of Indo-Iranianmysticism.  Zarathushtra's greatness, however, does not lie in his having belonged to aparticular religious tradition. Rather, it lies in the innovation and strengthof his message, which was in itself a break in the tradition, one that force-fully and effectively introduced two great revolutionary ideas: dualisticmonotheism (the Wise Lord who fathers two twin spirits, the beneficent and theevil); and the expectation of a transfiguration (Av., Frashokereti; Pahl.,Frashgird) of life and existence. [See Frashokereti]   Both his monotheistic and dualistic ideas and his particular soteriologicaldoctrine deeply separate Zarathushtra's teachings from the Indo-Iranian tradi-tions of his upbringing. They exemplify his rebellion against a formalisticand ritualistic religion that did not provide adequate answers to the problemof evil. Because of his basic tenets, Zarathushtra, who advocated an inwardreligiosity and the right of the individual to resist the imperatives of tradi-tion, can be numbered among the greatest of religious figures.  Another original facet of Zarathushtra's message, one that is not easy tounderstand but which, however, holds the key to a deeper understanding of thecomplex intellectual and poetic structure of the Gathas, is the doctrine of theAmesha Spentas, the "beneficent immortals." These are spiritualizations of theabstract notions of good thought, best truth, desirable power, bounteousdevotion, wholeness, and immortality, all of which operate according to asystem of interrelations and correlations and can simultaneously be themanifestations of a divinity and of human virtue. [See Amesha Spentas.]  Other than the names of his father, Pourushaspa ("possessing gray horses"),and of his mother, Dughdova ("one who has milked"), we know almost nothing ofZarathushtra's life. A late Pahlavi text also give the names of four brothers.According to tradition, Zarathushtra left home at the age of twenty, and atthirty he was subject to a revelation, both through an intense and powerfulinspiration and through a vision. Only after ten years had passed, however, didhe succeed in converting a cousin of his, Maidhyoimah, to his beliefs. He wasstrongly opposed in his native land by kavis, karapans, and usijs, priestlygroups associated with traditional teachings and practices. This hostilitycaused him to leave his region (Yasna 46:1) and to seek refuge at the court ofKavi Vishtaspa, a ruler who had been converted to the new religion together withhis wife, Hutaosa, when the prophet, according to tradition, was forty-twoyears old. We also know the name of a son, Isat Vastra ("desiring pastures"),and of three daughters born of his first wife, as well as the names of two moresons, Urvatatnara ("commanding men") and Hvarecithra ("sun-faced"), born ofhis second wife, Hvovi, a member of the influential Hvogva ("possessing goodcattle") family. Two other figures belonging to the Hvogva family are mentioned:Frashaoshtra and Jamaspa, the former as Hvovi's father, and the latter as thehusband of the third daughter of the prophet, Pouruchista ("very thoughtful"),whose wedding is celebrated in the fifth hymm in the Gathas (Yasna 53). Again,according to tradition, Zarathushtra died at the age of seventy-seven. He wasassassinated by a karapan, a priest of the old religion, who belonged to theTuirya tribe and was called Tur i Bradres (his name is known only in the Pahlaviform).  The paucity of information on the prophet's life is compensated by a tradi-tion, rich in legendary detail, that arose through the centuries in Zoroastriancommunities. The main texts documenting the tradition are the seventh book ofthe Denkard, a Pahlavi work dating from the ninth century CE, as well aspassages from other Pahlavi texts and a New Persian work from the thirteenthcentury, the Zarathusht-nama (Book of Zarathushtra), written by Zaratusht-iBahram-i Pazhdu. Mythical and ritual elements prevail in the later legends aboutZarathushtra, which idealize him into a symbol and make him the archetype of theperfect man.  Zarathushtra's great popularity in the ancient world continued throughout theRenaissance until the Enlightenment. During the Classical and Hellenisticperiods he was viewed as a wise man, a typical representative of an "alienwisdom," a master of the secrets of heaven and earth, a seer, astrologer,psychologist, and wonder worker. Pythagorean thinkers went so far as to see theinfluence of Zarathushtra on Pythagoras himself, and the Academicians alwaysopenly admired the Persian thinker who founded the school of the Magi andadvocated a doctrine of dualism. Earliest Christianity viewed Zarathushtra asa precursor of the Christian faith, one who not only prophesied, as had thebiblical prophets, the advent of the Messiah but also predicted the supernaturalsign of his coming, the star that was to appear in the East and guide the threeMagi to the manger in Bethlehem. [See Magi.] This Christian interpretation isderived from the Zoroastrian doctrine of the Saoshyant, the Savior of theFuture. [See Saoshyant.] Later, however, religious struggles arose during theSasanid empire in Persia (third to seventh centuries CE), which linked thespread of Christianity with the Roman empire. Zarathushtra's popularity in theChristian world began to decline. The Iranian prophet, who had been praisedoften by the gnostic schools and who had been seen by Mani as one of the threegreat messengers from the past, was now seen, instead, as a leader of impostureand heresy, a teacher of the diabolic arts of witchery. But during the Renaiss-ance and the Enlightenment, European cultures reverted to the image of Zara-thushtra that had come down through Classical and Hellenistic antiquity. He wasviewed, once again, as a great and wise man, as the author of the _ChaldeanOracles_ and probably inventor of Qabbalah, as a teacher of astrology, as apossible bridge between Christianity and Platonism, and, at times (as inVoltaire), as a symbol of non-Christian wisdom.  After Western philology rediscovered Zarathushtra during the eighteenth andnineteenth centuries, Friedrich Nietzsche, in an intentional paradox, gavethe name Zarathustra to the hero of his work _Also sprach Zarathustra_ (1883-1892). Nietzsche saw the Iranian prophet as the first to have discovered thetrue motive force underlying all things, that is, the eternal struggle betweengood and evil. [See also Zoroastrianism]

And it works the other way, too, and I have repeatedly said so.  Never have I said or meant anything different, here or elsewhere, and I don't think my communication skills betrayme.  Nor do I presume to offend people's spiritual sensibilities, asI would hope others would not disparage mine.Rich Fox, Anthro, Usouthdakota

So the math says that nothing can enter a black hole.It seems to me that you are mis-using physical intuition here.  My point isthat you are talking about global conditions influencing local phenomenainappropriately.  Remember that there is no such thing as a "global" frameof reference for time.  Our minds like to pretend that there is, and we imagine things like the calendar on Alpha Centaury being approx. 4 years off from ours on Earth.This is simply wrong.  There is NO global "time" which can be applied toevents on Alpha Centaury concurrently with events on Earth.  This is whatSpecial Relativity has taught us.  If I am travelling past the Earth ata high rate of speed toward A.C. I can even have a different view of the _order_ of the occurance of events on A.C. versus Earth.  Thus, the answer to the question, "what's happening on Alpha Centaury NOW?" is NOT well-defined, ifasked on Earth, until you specify all the relevant parameters such as relativevelocities and the like; AND it will have different answers for different values of these parameters.Now, in the vicinity of a black hole, the curvature of spacetime becomes important enough that this lack of a global frame of reference becomes very important.  In particular, the frame used by a distant observer is quite different from the frame appropriate to the falling object.  Our minds just don't seem able to easily deal with the idea that time itself could be behaving differently in these two locations, but the equations of relativity say that it does.  We would _like_ to say "the falling object is hoveringabove the horizon, NOW", for an object whose frame has rotated wholly "away"from ours.  In a very real sense, once the object has fallen into the holeits gone forever from our ken.  Unless you volunteer to jump in after it,that is... :-) Gene Battin battin@cyclops.iucf.indiana.edu no .sig yet

Only when you have done thatcan we progress to debating whether this morality is absolute or not.There have been many claims that morality is a component of reality, butthen again, there have been plenty of claims made by different folk overthe centuries.

But if we don't limit it to *something*, the discussion degenerates intoa big amorphous glob. Other questions Thyagi proposes are:> 1) What is this 'actual process of reality'?> 2) Why is Taoism based upon an assumption?> 3) Why does this assumption concern knowledge and what can be known?> 4) What is the value of not knowing?> 5) What is 'a Tao'?  What does it mean to be 'Tao'd'?It seems to me that these questions more properly fall into thecategory of "general metaphysics". I would prefer any misc.taoismto deal more closely with topics and works more closely associatedwith at least "semi-orthodox" Taoism: with established classic works definitely included and works like Mantak Chia's argued about! I think "neo-Taoism" should be excluded or get its own group (what Imean by this is "Humpty-Dumpty Taoism", in which Taoism means whatever a poster says it means.) This "alt.taoism" could also be a refuge for debates about what "Taoism *REALLY* means" or speculations on sexualalchemy, etc..e.g. (from Thyagi again):> Taoism does what the hell it wants, I tell you.> Taoism doesn't exist.  'Taoism' is no more real that 'Tao'.  Decide, now.> Real or not real?  Exist or not-exist?  When shall we be certainKent gloomily predicts (quoting from Thyagi's article):> However most traffic in > the group will likely concern the philosophical, secular taoism> averred by Alan Watts and Niels Bohr, and yogic taoism as it pertains> to medical, sexual and martial techniques.I think that discussions of this nature are not completely out ofplace. What's happening is that that the term "Taoism" is becomingcompletely polluted and trivialized like the words "magic", "Alchemy", "Zen," etc., by writers appropriating the word to mean whatever they want. This is seen by the spate of new age books entitled "TheTao of" this, that, and everything else. (With respect to some exceptionslike the books by Jou, Tsung-Hwa.)Any other comments/ideas? I look forward to seeing them. On balance,I say let misc.taoism rip and let the chips fall where they may. Ifit just gets filled up with college freshmen asking about theTao of Sex then it will have been a failure and people will post tothese groups just as they do now.-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------Tim P.

Jesus said follow the TenCommandments AND the Torah And the Prophets. Christians on the otherhand are not only above the Ten Commandments AND the Torah AND theProphets, i.e. they believe that they do not have to follow it, theydon't even follow the subjective morality of Jesus! So, we see thatChristians can't follow the "objective morality" of their own TenCommandments, they can't follow the "subjective morality" of Jesus whenHe said follow the Ten Commandments, yet they expect the rest of theworld to do; what? Is there any logic here? Is there any morality here,objective or subjective? Is Christianity somebody's idea of a joke? Whocould be pulling the wool over the eyes of so many Christians?

Bill, I find it rather remarkable that you managed to zero in on what isprobably the weakest evidence.  What is probably the most convincing is the anti-Christian literature put outby the Jewish councils in the second century.  There are enormous quantities ofdetailed arguments against Christianity, many of the arguments still being usedtoday.  Despite volumes of tracts attacking Christianity, not one denies theexistance of Jesus, only of his activities.  I find this considerably more compelling than Josephus or the harmony of thegospels (especially considering that Matthew and Luke probably used Mark as asource). |  __L__-|-  ___  Warren Kurt vonRoeschlaub |  | o | kv07@iastate.edu |/ `---' Iowa State University/|   ___  Math Department |  |___| 400 Carver Hall |  |___| Ames, IA  50011 J  _____

Jamesthe Just was judicially murdered a few years earlier, but there isevidence that the church survived him. There is no evidence that it stillexisted after the assault on the city. The individuals historicallyassociated with that church disappear at that time. 2. The followers of Jesus included a number of individuals whose nicknamessuggested connections with the Jewish terrorism of the time (Zealotes,Iscariot, "Sons of Thunder").3. For cult psychology, there's an extensive literature.4. For an understanding of the motivation of the members of the Jerusalemchurch, there is a mixed collection of sources. The Anchor Bible has someinteresting articles, but one thing I've noticed about biblicalscholarship is that intellectual honesty and a skeptical approach arenotably lacking. You basically have to spread your net wide and thenwinnow. (For example, Allegro and Schoenfeld have some interesting ideas,but they were both "over the top.") Many interesting ideas have not beenfollowed up, mostly due to religious reasons. What was the connection ofearly Christian theology to Samaritan dualism and proto-gnosticism? (SeeStephen's speech in Acts for a Samaritan interpretation of thecrucifixion.) Schweitzer's interpretation of Jesus's motivations could beupdated, especially now that we have the Essene and Chenoboskianmaterials. And so it goes. (For instance, the convincing statisticalevidence concerning the authorship of the Pauline materials has beencompletely ignored by biblical scholars.)I don't track this area much any more. (My coursework is 20 years old.) Ihave a personal theory that the synoptics were written in Syria during thecourse of the Jewish Revolt. I suspect Mark was written before the fall ofJerusalem as an apology to get the Romans and Roman-sympathizers off theback of the local Greek Christians. Matthew and Luke were written withsimilar goals, but incorporating additional materials. Given the evidencein the Gospel of Thomas (Chenoboskien), I suspect Q came from a Samaritan(proto-gnostic) milieu. In any case, they were written in an environmentcut off by time or circumstances from Jerusalem, not expecting furthercontact, and not wanting to be connected by outsiders to the themes of thedoctrines held by the Jerusalem church.Sorry about the lack of documentation, but the time is hard to find.-- Harry ErwinInternet: erwin@trwacs.fp.trw.comHave found some interesting work...

Just as the supreme aide of a renowned ruler, arrivingwith many gifts in a city where various people live, will bewelcomed by a representative of each people whoacclaims him and bids him welcome in his own languageso, too, when the supreme messenger of the Monarch ofPre- and  Post-Eternity  (Ezel and Ebed  Sultani) honored theuniverse by coming as an envoy to the inhabitants of theearth, and brought with him the light of truth and spiritualgifts sent by the Creator of the universe and derived fromthe realities of the whole universe, each species ofcreation -from water, rocks, trees, animals and humanbeings to the moon, sun and stars- welcomed him andacclaimed his prophethood, each in its own language, andeach bearing one of his miracles.    Now it would require a voluminous work to mention allhis miracles.  As the punctilious scholars have writtenmany volumes concerning the proofs of His prophethood,here we will briefly point out only the general categoryinto which fall fhe miracles that are definite and acceptedas accurate reports.    The evidences of the prophethood of Muhammad(SAW) fall into two main categories:      The first is called irhasat and includes the paranormal events that happened at the time of his birth, or before his declaration of prophethood.      The second group pertains to all the remaining evidences of the prophethood, and contains two subdivisions:     1) Those wonders that were manifested afterhis departure from this world in order to confirm hisprophethood, and 2) Those that he exhibited during the eraof his prophethood.  The latter has also two parts:  2.1) The evidences of his prophethood that became manifestin his own personality, his inner and outer being, his moralconduct and perfection, and     2.2) The miracles that: related to substantial matters.  The last part again has two branches:  2.2.1) Those concerning the Qur'an and spirituality, and 2.2.2) Those relating to matter and creation.  This last branch is again divided into two categories:  2.2.2.1) The first involves the paranormal happenings that occured during his mission either to break the stubbornness of the unbelievers, or to augment thefaith of the belivers.  This category has twenty differentsorts, such as the splitting of the moon, the flowing ofwater from the fingers, the satisfying of large numbers witha little food, and the speaking of trees, rocks and animalsEach of these sons has also many instances, and thushas, in meaning, the strength of confirmation byconsensus.  2.2.2.2)  As for the second category, thisincludes events lying in the future that occured as he hadpredicted upon Allah (SWT)'s instructions.  Now startingfrom the last category, we will summarize a list of them.(1)(1) Unfonunately, I could not write as I had intendedwithout choice, I wrote as my head dictated, and I couldnot completely conform to the order of this classification.-----------------------------------------------------------------To be Continued Allah Willing.Irfan Alan, A Servant of Islam.

They had advertised thatthey were holding a lecture titled The Graal of the King -- the roomof the heart (which rhymes in Swedish). Out of curiosity, I went tothe lecture.There were four people there apart from the two Rosicrucians, onewoman and two men apart from me. The Rosicrucians were male, both ofthem. First one of them told us about the Rosicrucians and LectoriumRosicrucianum, which was founded in Harlem, NL in 1925. He readstraight from a piece of paper, which I at that point was because helacked experience in talking in front of people, but the other guyread, too, and he was used to holding speeches, I could tell. Thefirst guy also said that the R:s are a mystical Christian order, andthat they base their teachings on the teachings of the Kathars(English?) from the thirteenth century.The other guy took over, reading from his piece of paper in afairy-tale teller's voice. What he said sounded like a load of crap tome. Of course that might be because I am unenlightened or something.What made me a bit suspicious, was the way they first said that we allcontained something divine, and could find our way back to divinity,then that we couldn't become divine as the persons we are currently,but if we worked really hard we would reach eternal bliss. Maybe I'veread too much RAW, but it sounded very much like the things he talksabout in the chapter _How to robotize people and brainwash yourfriends_ in _Prometheus rising_. It was very interesting to watch the two Rosicrucians. The one holdingthe actual lecture, obviously was top dog, and the other one seemed tobe a true believer. I got the impression that the top dog had moredistance to the faith than the true believer, that he used it to gainpower and admiration. He spoke like a fairy-tale teller, whenever heremembered. ;)The information brochure is at home.

All of the writers musthave received their information from the early Christians,perhaps second or third hand.  None of these references give anyhint that the writers had any independent information aboutJesus. These references do show that the early Christians were having aninfluence, at least enough to earn a few lines here and there inother peoples' writings.  But the typical use to which they areput by some Christian apologists, in making psuedo-historicalarguments a la Josh, is totally specious.Russell

Is it:(a) Both are right(b) One of them is wrong, and sometimes (though perhaps rarely) we have a     pretty good idea who it is(c) One of them is wrong, but we never have any information as to who, so    we make our best guess if we really must make a decision.(d) The idea of a "right" moral judgement is meaningless (implying that     whether peace is better than war, e.g., is a meaningless question,     and need not be discussed for it has no correct answer)(e) Something else.  A short, positive assertion would be nice.As I hope you can tell, (b) and (c) are actually predicated onthe assumption that values are real  - so statements like these_can't_ consistently derive from the relativist assumption that valuesaren't part of objective reality.  -- Frank O'Dwyer                                  'I'm not hatching That'odwyer@sse.ie                                  from "Hens",  by Evelyn Conlon

However, the Founding Fathers(Washington, Jefferson, Madison, etc.), practically made it theirlife's work to ensure that religious intolerance would not destroytheir great experiment... a democratic republic.I strongly suggest that those interested get some of Jefferson's andMadison's writings. Particularly good is Madison's "(something)andRemonstrance", [yea, I'm litterate and have functioning memory cells:-( ].  IMHO, Jefferson and Madison were the two greatest American'swho ever lived. Although both were products of their time (Jeffersonwas a slave owner), they were able to see more clearly than theircontemporaries, and for that matter, more clearly than most modernpoliticians. Their prose is the epitome of eloquence. I don't knowabout y'all, but reading the Declaration of Independence give memental goosebumps. (For those who have never read it, I am appending acopy of it.)--In CONGRESS, July 4, 1776The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America,When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for onepeople to dissolve the political bands which have connected them withanother, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate andequal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitlethem, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that theyshould declare the causes which impel them to the separation.We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are createdequal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienableRights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit ofHappiness.  That to secure these rights, Governments are institutedamong Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of thegoverned.  That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive ofthese ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it,and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on suchprinciples and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shallseem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.  Prudence,indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not bechanged for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experiencehath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils aresufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to whichthey are accustomed.  But when a long train of abuses and usurpations,pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce themunder absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, tothrow off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their futuresecurity.Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such isnow the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systemsof Government.  The history of the present King of Great Britain is ahistory of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in directobject the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.  Toprove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessaryfor the public good.He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressingimportance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent shouldbe obtained, and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attendto them.He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of largedistricts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right ofRepresentation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them andformidable to tyrants only.He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their publicRecords, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance withhis measures.He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing withmanly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to causeothers to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable ofAnnihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise;the State remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers ofinvasion from without, and convulsions within.He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for thatpurpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners;refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, andraising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing hisAssent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure oftheir offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms ofOfficers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies, without theconsent of our legislatures.He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior tothe Civil power.He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign toour constitution and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent totheir Acts of pretended Legislation:For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:For protecting them by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders    which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:For depriving us in many cases of the benefits of Trial by Jury:For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring    Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and    enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example    and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into    these Colonies:For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and    altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested    with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.He has abdicated Government here by declaring us out of his Protectionand waging War against us.He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, anddestroyed the lives of our people.He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries tocomplete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begunwith circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in themost barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilizednation.He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seasto bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners oftheir friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavouredto bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless IndianSavages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destructionof all ages, sexes and conditions.In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress inthe most humble terms.  Our repeated Petitions have been answered onlyby repeated injury.  A Prince, whose character is thus marked by everyact which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a freepeople.Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren.We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature    to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and    settlement here.We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity,    and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow    these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections    and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice     and of consanguinity.We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our    Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies     in War, in Peace Friends.We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, inGeneral Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of theworld for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by theauthority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish anddeclare.  That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to beFree and Independent States; that they are Absolved from allAllegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connectionbetween them and the State of Great Britain is and ought to be totallydissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have fullPower to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establishCommerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent Statesmay of right do.

I hope you are not Catholic, because my Christianupbringing was based on the teachings of Luther, and the one ofthe core messages was basically that you don't need to know latinin order to learn about salvation.BTW, your statement would also eliminate about 99.5% of all the Christiansin the world, as well.Cheers,Kent---sandvik@newton.apple.com.

The feast WAS the Seder, and the accounts of it are very clearon this point.The difference is the connection between the bread and wine and the bodyand blood of god.  This is an old association of the Tammuz/Osiris/Mithrasline, and not really related to Judaism.  In any case, I didn't reallyintend to argue the point.

Some people may also reason that by reading the bible and being a Xtianyou are permanently damaging your brain.  By your logic, it would be OKfor them to come into your home, take away your bible, and send you offto "re-education camps" to save your mind from ruin.  Are you ready forthat?  /(hudson)/And why is there nothing wrong with it?  Because you say so?  Who gave you/the authority to say that, and set the standard for morality?Why?Because: I am a living, thinking person able to make choices for myself.I do not "need" you to show me what you think is the way; I have observedtoo many errors in your thinking already to trust you to make up therules for me.Because:I set the standard for my *own* morality, and I permit you to do the same for yourself.  I also do not try to force you to accept my rules.Because:Simply because you don't like what other people are doing doesn't give youthe right to stop it, Hudson.  We are all aware that you would like for everyone to be like you.  However, it is obnoxious, arrogant thinking like yours, the "I-know-I'm-morally-right-so-I-can-force-it-on-you" bullshit that has brought us religious wars, pogroms against Jews, gay-bashing,and other atrocities by other people who, like you, "knew" they weremorally right.(me)>What is it with you, Hudson?

It is not a moral standard that I am presenting you with, Hudson.  It isa key to getting along in life with other people.  It is also a point ofrespect:  I trust other people to be intelligent enough to make theirown choices, and I expect the same to be returned.  You, on the otherhand, do not trust them, and want to make the choice for them--whetherthey like it or not.It is also a way to avoid an inconsistency:  if you believe that you have the right to set moral standards for others and interfere in their lives, then you must, by logic, admit that other people have the same right of interference in your life.  (Yes, I know; you will say that your religion is correct and tells you thatonly agents acting in behalf of your religion have the right of interference.However, other people will say that you have misinterpreted the Word ofGod and that *they* are the actual true believers, and that you areacting on your own authority.  And so it goes).(hudson)/Who gave/you the authority to set such a moral standard for me to tell me that I /cannot set a moral standard for others?You can set all the standards that you want, actually.  But don't be surprisedif people don't follow you like rats after the Pied Piper.  At the most basic form, I am not going to LET you tell me what to do;and if necessary, I will beat you to a bloody pulp before I let you actuallyinterfere in my life.Now, at a more humane level than that, I recognize that all people aresentient beings possessed of intelligence and capable of reason.  I alsorecognize that they, like I, appreciate being treated with respect andallowed to make their own decisions.

Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I'lltry to get better.Rob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentleapproach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far,only responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In bothcases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excusefor myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.Rob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K. vasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next isan excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.  I think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable withhis set of excuses.  I just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wantsto know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuseswhich have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read theBible for himself and come to his own decisions without beingsidetracked with the temptation to mock God.From my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a manstanding out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I see a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced awayfrom the oncoming truck.  He doesn't see it.   Here's is how I seethe dialog:Me:  "Brian K, please step aside before you get run over." BK:  "There is no truck."Me:  "Turn around at look."BK:  "No."Me:  "Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at     the oncoming truck."BK:  "No. Explain to me why trucks exist."Me:  "Turn around or you will run over."BK:  "No. I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday."Me:  "You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing      to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life."      I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.BK:  "It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.      Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me."      And by the way, I really have an open mind."So is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?   I do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if notbillions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all peoplefall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have.I can now see the truck behind Brian.My hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of thetruck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step outof the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himselfto the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But ifhe so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond thatto change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment,Brian hasn't gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where hedoes not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but hishead will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he issatisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. Thank you again Rob for your reproach.  I really do appreciate it.  (Mywife tells me the same thing at times.)   :-)   I will try to do better.

Then you can come home to something like this:    "Well, it's been a rough month," begins Johnnie Lawmaster.  "I just get laid off, and my divorce became final.  But I just wasn't ready for what happened this particular Monday."    That particular Monday was was December 16, the first day of the Bill of Rights' third century, the day when federal agents and local law enforcement officer broke into the house in Tulsa that always flew the U.S. flag.  When Lawmaster drove into the driveway that bleak afternoon, one of his neighbors had some news.    "'Ohmigod, John, you are in big trouble!' my neighbor tells me. 'Sixty police, federal agents and the bomb squad busted in you house, kicked down the door, cut locks off your gun safe.'  I couldn't believe it.  Then I walked inside.  What a nightmare."    It was no nightmare; it was horribly real life.  Apparently acting on information the Lawmaster possessed an illegal firearm, some thirty agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) teamed up with state and Tulsa police authorities, search warrant in hand, to search for a "Colt, AR-15, .223 caliber machine gun, unknown serial number."  The warrant, issued by U.S. Magistrate John Leo Wagner, also authorized agents to seize "any tools used in the alteration or modification of firearms, such as files or drills; documents, papers, books, records, and other tangible properties which identify occupants or owners of the property to be searched...."    Reports vary, but according to neighbors, the joint task force operation aimed at the unemployed warehouseman from a nearby hospital involved some 60 agents and local law enforcement personnel against Lawmaster.  They cordoned off the street; took station with weapons drawn in the back yard; used a battering ram to break through the front door; kicked in the back door; broke into his gun safe; threw personal papers around the house; spilled boxes of ammunition on the floor; broke into a small, locked box that contained precious coins; stood on a table to peer through the ceiling tiles, breaking the table in the process.  Then, they left.  The doors were closed but not latched, much less locked.  The ammo and guns were left unsecured.    "My front and back doors were pulled shut, but they were busted through and couldn't latch.  Anybody could have waltzed in there and stolen everything I own.  A child could have taken a gun.  The guns, the safe -- everything was open and laying around.  I keep all my magazines empty, but someone had loaded them.  While I was looking around in amazement, the gas, electric and water companies show up to turn the power off.  They said they were told to shut things down. Then I found the note.  "Nothing Found - ATF."    "They didn't make any attempt to notify me.  I've lived in Tulsa all my life and never got more than a traffic ticket.  How come they can't look that up, realize I've been law-abiding my whole life, then come to the door when I'm home?  They didn't leave someone here to watch over my private property.  They didn't even come by to explain what happened.  They just raided my home, ransaked it, left it wide open and left."    Lawmaster placed a phone call to the local BATF agent.  "I asked, 'Are you gonna' arrest me?' and he said, 'No.'  I asken him, "Who is going to repair and clean up my house?'  And he said, "If you're going to talk to me, come down to my office.'    "'I can't come down!' I said.  'My doors are broken!'  If I had been on vacation and I didn't have friendly neighbors, I would have lost everything I own.  Here I am a competent, responsible firearms owner, and the government leaves them open, unlocked, with ammo strewn around."    Lawmaster said the agent advised him, "If you want your door to lock and your gun safe to lock, you're gonna' have to pay for it yourself."    "'Oh, I'll come right down, alright,' I told him.  'I'll come down, but I'll bring my attorney.'  And he said, 'Well, you bring your attorney, and we won't talk to you.'"So if you don't want your tea party to be held in awkward silence, makesure your lawyer isn't there, there's a good chap.> It's very sad all those people died, especially the kids, but that's going> to happen in a free society whenever psychologically needy people hook up> with a charismatic nutcase.What a repulsive outlook on society.

Well, the best thing to do is to read the book "Parallel Universes"by Dr. Fred Wolf. In essence, Dr. Wolf says that one interpretation of the sub-atomicparticle/wave duality is that what we perceive as a wave is actuallyan infinate number of parallel universes overlaid, and in each ofthese universes there is a particle in a different location. When wedo something to make a particle "appear," we are actually causingall the parallel universes to collapse into one. Apparently this isone line of thought on the nature of QM, that is going through someof the scientific community.Dr. Wolf (and many others) claim that somehow the collapse is causedby the mental effort of observing the particle. This implys thatmind is more than merely a biological phenomenon. He then extrapolatesthat if mind is an integral part of the universe, then perhaps consciousnessis the element that gives order and form to the universe(s) it/themself(s).It all gets rather interesting, but what I find facinating is thatthis would explain the phenomenon of "magick" as practiced in myreligion. Dr. Wolf speculates that the ordering functionality of mindcould be caused by the selection of a future from an infinite number ofpossible futures; he says that this might be done by some sort ofcommunication between ones current, and possible future selves. I have long speculated that if magick is not merely a form of selfdelusion then perhaps it could be caused by some sort of a selectionof one of many possible futures.I realize that this gets pretty bizarre, but it never hurts to keep an open mind and at least file it all away as another possibile explaination of the world in which we find ourselves. After all, themore we learn about the universe in which we live, the more we learnthat it is truly a very strange place.>Nancieric

Contrary to what Dr. Fox hasbeen saying, however, present consensus is *not* that the longerpassage in Josephus about Jesus was inserted, but only that it wasmodified.   There is no question that it was *at least* modified (based on whatOrigen says--that Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah), butI don't think the argument that it appears "out of context" is a verygood one.  (I haven't looked at the context for a while; perhaps somebodycould give some of the sentences which precede and follow the Jesuspassage.)Jim Lippard              Lippard@CCIT.ARIZONA.EDUDept. of Philosophy      Lippard@ARIZVMS.BITNETUniversity of ArizonaTucson, AZ 85721

What Peter says about God is whatthe Bible says.   Consider the Bible a court recording.  Over the period of thousands ofyears, various people come up and testify of their experience with theliving God.  Up comes Abraham the wealthy rancher.  Up comes Moses,once the high official of Egypt.  Up comes Elijah, a priest.  Up comesDavid, a mere shepherd who became King.  Up comes the pagan King Nebuchanezzar.  Up comes the pagan King of Persia, Cyrus.  Up comesNehemiah, cupbearer to the King of Persia.  Then Matthew, an IRS agenttakes the stand.  Up comes Luke, an M.D.  Then Paul a Jew who useto kill Christians for fun.  Up comes John, a 17 year old boy.  Upcomes Peter, a fishermen.  Up comes James, the brother of Jesus himself.Up comes hundreds of others.  You hear testimony from fishermen, IRSagents, priests, Kings.  The court hearing lasts thousands of yearswith people coming up and testifying about the God who calls himself"I am." While you are listening to all this stuff, you realize thatKing David could have never known John, Solomon could have never knownMatthew, Nehemiah could have never known Peter.  You realize that all thesepeople are independent witnesses, and so, you rule out collaboration.  Yetall of the witnesses tell of the same God.   Each testifier tellsof his own experiences with the living God.  Each experience isdifferent, but each experience has enough cross-over to unmistakenlyreveal that each one of these people is talking about the very same God.What Daniel did not know about God, the 3rd Highest Official ofBabylon, God revealed to John 600 years later--but with a differentperspective.  No two testimonies are identical.  Each testimonydares to venture off what is already known.  Yet each witness'stestimony, even though different from those prior, consistentlydescribes harmoniously fitting facets of the character of the same God.  Now.  As we stare gazing at the computer, you got this seeming fanaticon the other end of the net, saying, I know this God  "I am".  He hasrevealed himself to me too.  He also calls himself Jesus (John 8:58).Please believe me.  I am telling the truth.  It is wonderful to know him.Are you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness? Are you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony fromshepherds to IRS agents to royal officials to kings to computerprogrammers, fiction?  With a scoff of your keyboard, with nearcomplete ignorance of the testimonies, are you going to say thatthat is all complete hooey?   Would that not be the most audaciousdisplay of arrogance?  Do you actually think you know better thanKing Solomon, King David, or even Abraham Lincolnr?

Who is he? >Please do not answer with "A well known evolutionist" or some other such>informationless phrase.   Francis Hitching is the author of, among other books,_The Neck of the Giraffe_." He believes evolution isdirected by some sort of cosmic force, but does not likeDarwinism.  He wrote in this book [ _The Neck of theGiraffe_, Ticknor & Fields, New Haven, Connecticut, 1982,p. 12 (p. 4, paperback)] that:   For all its acceptance in the scientific world as the   great unifying principle of biology, Darwinism, after   a century and a quarter, is in a surprising amount of   trouble.  Evolution and Darwinism are often taken to   mean the same thing.  But they don't.  Evolution of   life over a very long period of time is a fact, if we   are to believe evidence gathered during the last two   centuries from geology, paleontology, molecular biol-   ogy and many other scientific disciplines.  Despite   the many believers in Divine creation who dispute this   ..., the probability that evolution has occurred   approaches certainty in scientific terms....  On the   other hand Darwinism (or neo-Darwinism, its modern   version) is a theory that seeks to explain evolution.   It has not, contrary to general belief, and despite   very great efforts, been proved.   Research on Hitching turned up the following: Hitching isbasically a sensational TV script writer and has no scien-tific credentials.  In _The Neck of the Giraffe_ he claimedto be a member of the Royal Archaeological Institute, but aninquiry to that institute said he was not.  He implied inthe "Acknowledgements" of _The Neck of the Giraffe_ thatpaleontologist Stephen Jay Gould had helped in the writingof the book, but upon inquiry Gould said he did not know himand had no information about him.  Hitching also impliedthat his book had been endorsed by Richard Dawkins, but uponinquiry Dawkins stated: "I know nothing at all about FrancisHitching.  If you are uncovering the fact that he is a char-latan, good for you.  His book, _The Neck of the Giraffe,_is one of the silliest and most ignorant I have read foryears."   Hitching believes in the paranormal and has written onMayan pyramid energy and for some "In Search Of..." episodeson BBC television.  The reference work _ContemporaryAuthors,_ Vol. 103, page 208, lists him as a member of theSociety for Psychical Research, the British Society ofDowsers and of the American Society of Dowsers.  His writ-ings include: _Earth Magic,_ _Dowsing: The Psi Connection,__Mysterious World: An Atlas of the Unexplained,_ _Fraud,Mischief, and the Supernatural_ and _Instead of Darwin_.   Hitching's book spends much of its time attacking Dar-winian evolution, borrowing heavily and uncritically fromyoung-earth creationist arguments.  Many of Hitching's "ref-erences" are lifted from young-earth creationist literaturerather than being quoted directly from their originalsources.  One magazine had this to say [_Creation/EvolutionNewsletter_, 7, No. 5, pp. 15-16, September/October 1987]:   Speaking of the Biblical Creation Society, there was   an interesting letter in the January 1983 issue of   their journal Biblical Creation (p. 74) concerning a   review of Francis Hitching's 1982 book _The Neck of   the Giraffe_.  Hitching's book is strongly anti-   Darwinist, and is enthusiastically hailed by most cre-   ationists (though he also pokes fun at fundamentalist   creationists).  The letter, by creationist Malcolm   Bowden (author of _The Rise of the Evolution Fraud_),   points out that Hitching simply "culled his informa-   tion from the creationist literature."  This is indeed   the case:  many creationist works are cited favorably   (Anderson, Coffin, Clark, Daly, Davidheiser, Dewar,   Gish, Morris, Segraves, Whitcomb, and Wysong, plus   various anti-Darwinists).  Hitching does cite Bowden's   earlier book _Ape-Men -- Fact or Fallacy?_, but Bowden   accuses Hitching of "lifting" several passages and   illustrations from his book without acknowledgment:   in other words, plagiarism.  "Hitchin's [sic] book is   largely an exposition of the creationists [sic] view-   point from the beginning to almost the end," Bowden   points out....  Hitching is also a paranormalist, an   advocate of psychic evolution.... [Hitching's book]   _Earth Magic_ is a wild, extremely entertaining and   thoroughly psychic interpretation of megalithic struc-   tures....  Hitching also includes in his scheme cosmic   cataclysms, Atlantis, pyramidology, dowsing, ESP,   miraculous healing, and astrology.-------------------------------------------------------Alan Feuerbacheralanf@atlas.pen.tek.com

He himself said why in John 12:23-32.  Itisn't a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need fora persuasive argument.   Read Jesus's own reply to yourquestion.Jesus gives more reasons in John 16:7.  But one obvious reasonwhy Jesus died, (and as with everything else, it has nothing do withhis punishment) was that he could rise to life again--so thatwe would "stop doubting and believe" (John 21:27).  The factthat Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will risefrom the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it.Without this obvious point, I would have no hopeand my faith would be vanity.Why did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesussays why in John 15:18-25.   That's no mystery either.  "Theworld hates him without reason."  It is a direct proclamationof how far we humans botch things up and thus, how much weneed a Saviour.And why can't you, Brian K., accept this?  How can you?  "Theworld cannot accept him because it neither sees him nor knowshim."  (John 14:17).   The animosity and the lack of knowledgethat comes out in your twistings of Robert's daily verses isvery convincing testimony of the truth of John 14:17 and 16:25.I pray and hope that I do blurt out such animosity and lack ofknowledge. I am not perfect either.  But regardless of that, I thankGod that Jesus revealed himself to me, without whom I'd also bebumbling about blindly though arrogantly slandering the veryPerson who created me and who loves me.

The concepts of "right"#and "wrong" (or "correct/incorrect" or "true/false") belong to the#domain of epistemological rather than moral questions.  It makes no#sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is#legitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).##Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives#of epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation, respectively.#One can certainly ask if a percept is "right" (correct, true,#veridical) or "wrong" (incorrect, false, illusory).  But it makes little#sense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand, it is#strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can#certainly ask that question about motives.##Therefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can't be considered:#they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.True, by "correct" I mean "the thing valued is really good".  I shoulduse evaluative terms, but I don't always.  Sorry for the sloppy phrasing.Can you answer if "betterness" is used in in place of @correctness"?##Now the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled:  I agree with#the first part (that the "rightness" of a moral position is a#meaningless question), for the reasons stated above.  But that is#irrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that#one cannot feel peace is better than war.  I certainly can make#value judgments (bad, better, best) without asserting the "correctness"#of the position.You can never say that the thing is @really better@, or "more likelyto better, from all realistic frames of reference"?##Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d).  My short (e) answer is#that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue,#neither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect).  They simply hold#different moral values (feelings).This is where my difficulty arises, though I'm starting to getin now.

Carmel "camp" on Monday.Neither is Atty. General Reno.  The issuance of tear gas might have not beenthe best idea to achieve the extrication of the Branch Davidians, butprevious attempts through negotiation had fallen through and the FBI had said that this was to end asap.One person and one person ONLY is to blame for this. Vernon Howell aka David Koresh. It was he who issued the order to start shooting at the BATF agents when they went to serve the arrest warrant on Feb 28. It was the Davidians who KILLED four law enforcement agents, and injured several others. It was Koresh who refused to peacefully walk out of the compound and fight out the legalities in a court of law, with a jury of 11 citizens. (note: I can't saya jury of his peers, as his writings indicate that he thought that he was Jesus. It would be pretty difficult to find that many self-appointed prophets in the North Texas area.)As for who started the fires in the building, there have been numerous localnews reports with interviews with some of the rescued people stating in facttheir own people were starting the fires.  Once again, it wasn't Reno, or Clinton who lit the matches in this. It was Vernon Howell. The only people in the building I feel sorry for are the children who perished in the blaze,as they had no choice in the matter. The rest of them had every chance.So Steven, please scrape up your pennies and nickels and go buy yourself aclue.Tom-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Tom Hyatt                                  I'm a diehard Saints fan, so i've    thyat@sdf.lonestar.org                     suffered quite enough, thank you!

Very well put.  And, in the case of someone who calls himself a Christianbrother yet continues in his sin (and claims that his sin is not a sin at all, but perfectly acceptable), what should be done?  Should Christians just ignore a sinful lifestyle in order to not offend the person?  By reaffirming that the lifestyle is sinful according to the Bible, are they using "a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus"? Frankly, I find the occurance of a homosexual Christian attempting to pass himself off as a 'straight' Christian in order to have other Christians accept his chastisement better a *lot* more serious than people reaffirming that the Bible teaches homosexuality is a sin.

Maybe it was thegovernment; maybe it was Koresh.  I wouldn't immediately rule out thegovernment just because the FBI said that a couple of cult memberstorched Koresh's wood-frame house.  I think that the credibility of theFBI and the cigarette cops is questionable at best; at worst they arebald-faced liers.  I read in a newspaper today that one of the BDs thatsurvived the fire said that one of the tanks that crashed through theirwood-frame house knocked over a lantern which later on caused thecompound to errupt in flames.  Also, I have heard that one of the cultmembers who earlier said that he and another individual started the fireis no longer claiming that he did it.  Moreover, he and possibly theother person may not have even really said that they did it in thefirst place---we only have the FBI's WORD ON THIS.  I'll believe it whenI hear from a cult member's own mouth and not before then.The FBI claims that they saw two cult members starting the fire.  Theyclaimed that the two were clad in black clothing and were wearing gasmasks.  Hmmm...  Sounds like they might have been describing an ATFagent to me.  Weren't the cigarette cops wearing black?  Note:  thisis just speculation on my part.  Still, it is something to think about.Here's something else to ponder upon:  the two agents that were plantedin the compound might have done something to start that fire.  I don'tknow if they did it deliberately or not---if they did at all---but Iwould like to see statements from these two agents on the events thattranspired during that day.  I think that they would be ratherenlightening don't you think?  They were inside the compound so theyought to have a real good idea of what went on in there.  Of course ifthey did help burn down the house then I doubt that they would bevery forthcoming with any information.The FBI also mentioned that fire errupted in multiple locations in thecompound.  They *may* have said this so that people might be morelikely to be convinced that the BDs started the fire.  However,consider that if the FBI did light-up that house would they admit toit?  I think not.  Imagine the public outrage that would ensue ifpeople discovered that the FBI killed 86 people.  Obviously, the FBIwould do its best to suppress the truth and make people think the BDsstarted the fire.  Fire can spread in unusual ways in a wood house---fires burning in more than one location in a house isn't inconsistentwith a house fire.  The tear gas cannisters---which do produce heatdespite what you may have been told by the media---may have contributedto starting the blaze.  Also, it was very windy on the day of thefire.  Flames and burning debri might have floated over to parts ofthe house that weren't already on fire.  Like I said the verdict isn'tin yet.  The FBI may very well be guilty of a holocaust.> -- > John Mechalas                                          "I'm not an actor, but> mechalas@gn.ecn.purdue.edu                                 I play one on TV."> Aero Engineering, Purdue University                     #include disclaimer.hScott Kennedy,  Brewer and PatriotBefore:  "David Koresh is a cheap thug who interprets          the Bible through the barrel of a gun..."  --ATF spokesmanAfter:   "[The ATF] is a cheap thug who interprets          [the Constitution] through the barrel of a gun..."  --Me

If|> Jesus did in fact command his disciples to arm themselves, I would|> take that as yet another reason to reject Christian doctrine, for|> whatever it's worth.|> Let me clarify.  In order to more clearly understand scripture, one mustlook in the context of where the verse is found.  The section you referto here is found in Luke 22.  I'd like to start back at verse 35 and I'llinclude it here for the sake of completeness:   Then Jesus asked them, "When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals,   did you lack anything?"   "Nothing." the disciples replied.Verse 36 says:  "But now, if you have a purse take it and also a bag; and    if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.  It is written,    "And he was numbered with the transgressors."Verse 38 says:  The disciples said, "See, Lord, here are two swords."                "That is enough."  he replied.What does this all mean? In verse 35, Jesus points out to the disciples that when he sent them outpreviously, they did not need to take anything with them.  Their food,lodging and transport were often provided through the generosity of others.If verse 36, Jesus alludes to the change in attitude that is to come in thenear future.  Remember, Jesus was saying these things shortly before he wasto be arrested.  In verse 36, He tells the disciples that they will haveto take their own possessions and provisions with them.  THey will have tocarry their own purse because there will be no longer any generosity fromanyone.  And there will be times of peril when they will have to take careof themselves.  This was implied by the reference to the sword.  Jesus knewthat He was going to be arrested and labeled as a criminal.  The chargesbrought against Him were likely to be passed on to his disciples.In verse 38, we see that the disciples have taken Jesus too literally.  It isnot the first time that the disciples got His message wrong.  They had done this on several occassions.  Instead of understanding the gist of His words,they presented Him with two swords.  Jesus was perhaps taken aback bythis promptly concludes the discussion by saying, "That is enough."The disciples could not understand why Jesus had to die.  Jesus kept tellingthem over and over again that He would soon not be with them but they couldnot grasp this.  They wanted their Messiah to be a political leader who wouldlead them in rebellion against the Romans.  That is why they were so keen onpresenting Him with the swords.  They had no idea that Jesus was referring toa different kingdom of which they were to be a part of.  The disciples couldonly perceive of a kingdom on earth rather than the one in Heaven.Understand that Jesus NEVER intended his followers to take up arms in rebellion.This was clearly in evidence in Luke 22:51 when Jesus rebuked his disciples for using the sword against the servant of the high priest when they came to arrest Him.  As further evidence, Jesus goes so far as to heal the man injured by the disciples.  Jesus did NOT condone violence as a means for His purpose.Contrast this behaviour with that of David Koresh and you will clearly see thatDK was NOT Jesus as he claimed.  Jesus surrendered himself to the authouritiesand allowed himself to be crucified.  He didn't go out in a blaze of glory, butrather Jesus was executed like a common criminal.  I hope this makes it a little more clear.God be with you,Malcolm Lee  :)|> >>Well, when the nice federal officers come to my house to check out my|> >>extensive weapons cache, I'll just be sure not to shoot at them.|> >>"Tea, ladies and gentlemen?"|> |> >Actually, that's pretty much wht the "Branch Davidian" siad when|> >the local Sherrif knocked on their door.|> >Of course, when armed men assaulted them without warrning, it was a|> >different matter...|> |> Why?

Each time the Peace Torch changes hands, theflame of oneness burns a little brighter - until one day it willshine in the hearts and minds of every individual on earth.    ----  Making History  ----The three Peace Runs since 1987 have achieved some historic break-throughs: in the Middle East, a landmark run crossed the Egyptian-Israeli border; in Europe, a precedent-setting run linked Easternand Western Europe with Russia; in the United States, Mexico andCanada, entire cities were dedicated to the cause of world peace;and in Poland, the Peace Torch was blessed by Pope John Paul II. ----  Speaking as One: World  ----             ----  Leaders, Celebrities - and You  ----The Peace Run has won the support of leaders the world over -Presidents, Prime Ministers, religious leaders, sports figures andentertainment personalities.Its message has spread to a half billion people though newspaperreports, magazine articles and radio and TV broadcasts, includingspecials on PBS, MTV and NBC's Today Show.> "I am happy to support your Peace Run for justice, peace andreconciliation. The world must know that God wants us to liveamicably as brothers and sisters, members of one family, the humanfamily, God's family."  - Archbishop Desmond Tutu,  Nobel Peace Prize Winner   ----  How It All Works  ----Peace Run 1993 started with a five-borrough relay in New YorkCity on Saturday April 17, converging at various points to leadup to the opening ceremony outside the United Nations DagHammarskjold Building. There, runners from around the worldwere gathered for the fourth lighting of the Peace Torch.From there, Peace Torches are now being transported to overseventy countries for a series of concurrent international orcross-country relay runs including the United States, Canada,Japan, Australia, Russia and Eastern and Western Europe. Smallerruns will take place in the Philippines, Mexico, Israel, SouthAmerica, Egypt and elsewhere in Africa. Distance to be covered:31,000 miles.>"The Peace Run wil do much to inspire the hearts and stimulatethe minds of those who support, participate in, witness, or hearabout the event."  - Carl Lewis,                     Six-Time Olympic Gold Medalist                  ----  Who's Behind It  ----The Peace Run is sponsored by the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team, aninternational running organization that believes sports can be apowerful instrument for promoting world peace. Each year the Teamputs on hundreds of athletic events, including several world-classultramarathons, marathons and triathlons, in dozens of countries.The Peace Run itself is inspired by the global peace ambassadorSri Chinmoy, who has written and lectured extensively on peace,offered hundreds of free peace concerts and met with countlessworld figures to advance the cause of international harmony.The Run is managed by Peace Runs International, a non-profitorganization based in the United States.               ----  Take a Step For Peace  ----The Peace Runs in 1987, 1989 and 1991 attracted nearly half amillion participants. We're expecting even more people to joinPeace Run '93.You can also join the Run - carrying the Peace Torch a few steps,a few blocks or a few miles. Or you can come out and cheer therunners as they carry the Torch through your community.You can also join local celebrities and government officials inone of the thousands of welcoming ceremonies scheduled along the70-nation route.Your inner support is important too. If you're a runner, each timeyou go out, you can dedicate your run to the cause of world peace. ----  The Next Step is Yours  ---- ----  Make It One For Peace  ----For information contact:Peace Runs International161-44 Normal RoadJamaica, NY 11432 USAtel. 718/291-6637  Fax: 718/291-6978Peace Run Canada2456 Agricola StreetHalifax, Nova Scotia  B3K 4C2tel. 902/425-1174  Fax: 902/420-0773or for the phone number or address ofa Peace Run office in your town or country,reply to this message by e-mail.

There is norational reason to give an "abortionist" a "value" 10 million times thatof a fetus.  (Why not 10 billion, for instance...oh, but then you wouldloose on the deal.)Instead we should look at what is *really* involved in each abortion.There is the loss of a human life, a life that would otherwise haveeventually become a member of society.  That is certainly a non-zerovalue.  There is the physical and emotional suffering of a woman whofinds herself with an unwanted pregnancy, and the greater sufferingcaused by the refusal of society to allow her to deal with it.  Thatwoman is *already* a member of society.I argue that the cost of suffering of a *real* member of society isfar greater than the loss of a *potential* future member of society.Now, as for your "deal".  Suppose you "pay" the value of all the sufferingof every woman who *was* denied an abortion, or *would have been* deniedan abortion, under your desired position.  And "we" will "pay" the valueof all the potential future members of society that never became a part ofit (or *would* not have been a part of it, under *our* desired position).Think about it.Of course, I expect you will object to my argument that suffering ofon-going life is worse than loss of just-starting life.  If so, pleaseput forth some rational argument for how the life of a (currently)non-sentient creature is somehow worth the suffering of a sentient being.(I figure if I ask enough places, and such an arguement exists, I shouldeventually see it.)-Rob

The man-made laws are NOT working.                "WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS FAILURE TO COMMUNICATE!"            Perpetrators remain IGNORANT of The LAW--a universal, cosmic,           and Spiritual Law--The "LAW of RETRIBUTION" or "KARMA":                          "Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a           man soweth, that shall he also reap."  Galatians 6:7, KJV.                    "He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity;           he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword.            Here is the patience and faith of the saints."  Revelation           13:10, KJV.                    "What goes around comes around."               This LAW of the Universe is just as real as the physical           law that for every action there is an equal and opposite           REaction.                    It is the ENFORCEMENT, the TEETH, behind The "GOLDEN           RULE": "Do unto others as you would have others do unto you."                ALL perpetrators in the present will become VICTIMS in           the future, most likely in a FUTURE INCARNATION.  Most           victims in the present were PERPETRATORS in the past, usually           during a PREVIOUS LIFE.                          What is needed is a MASSIVE WORLDWIDE PROGRAM of           EDUCATION to teach ALL present and potential perpetrators, in           a convincing manner (with sufficient supporting evidence),           that what they do to others WILL BE DONE TO THEM, in this           life or the next.                          Anyone who doubts the FACT of REINCARNATION, and the           related "LAW of Retribution", should read books such as "HERE           AND HEREAFTER", by Ruth Montgomery, which describes several           kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation, including           HYPNOTIC REGRESSION to past lives [about 50% accurate; the           subconscious mind can sometimes make things up, especially           with a bad hypnotist], SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by           young children, some of whom can identify their most recent           previous relatives, homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL           of past life experiences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off           land while traveling there for the first time on vacation),           the psychic readings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN           SUPPORTING STATEMENTS FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including           Matthew 17:11-13 (John the Baptist was the REINCARNATION of           Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How can a person POSSIBLY sin before           he is born, unless he LIVED BEFORE?!).                          Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc.,           typically originate from a person's PAST LIVES.  For example,           a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually           results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.            And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to           another person being met for the first time in their PRESENT           life, because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS           INCARNATION.                People would behave much better toward each other if           they knew that their actions in the present will SURELY be           reaped by them in the future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION!

Bill, I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider theJosephus reference to be an early Christian insert.  By biblical scholar I meanan expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let thechips fall where they may.  This excludes literalists, who may otherwise bedefined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They arenot trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).Why an insert?  Read it - I have, a number of times.  The passage is glaringlyout of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere in his work.  The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which it lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.Until you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong aboutthe Josephus insert, your "proof" is meaningless and it should not be repeatedhere.  What's more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would "prove"nothing.  Scholars speak of the "weight of evidence."  Far more independentevidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, yourbelief is based on faith.  That's OK, but you exceed your rights when you passfaith off as fact.As for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaringinconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn't a perfect canon be perfect? Shouldn't there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel Fictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for Herb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share an evolutionary ancestry).The fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not denyyour position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels "prove" your faith. Independent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have alreadydiscussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith. Moreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attemptedto "prove" your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different thansaying "I am right because I say so."  Your logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian General Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where"fundamentalist" came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1)Jesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodilyresurrected, 4) Jesus' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is theclincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe"inerrant" broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take thefirst four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrantbible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to contain the first four.  Smoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!Its faith, Bill.  You don't have any more or better truths than anyone else. Whatever works for you.  Just don't foist it on others.

Morality is not a necessity for a functionalcollection of peoples, just a set of acceptable behaviours (is this the samething?).  There is no universal moral standard as there are many differentsituations in which collections of social organisms find themselves. Somespecies of bees see nothing wrong with kicking out a large number of malebees because they are being a burden on the food supplies of the colony. Thebees die of course, but it was for the good of the colony as a whole, so wasit immoral? Our society (at least our western one) is one of abundance when it comes tothe basics; food, water and shelter.  Therefore our moral standards arebased upon those circumstances.  Unfortunately we enforce our moralstandards on collections of peoples who are not in similar situations,because we believe in some "universal morality".  What I am saying is that,yes, you CAN still murder my sibling, but don't expect your peers to beimpressed by it in our society. However in some other circumstances, it mayactually be a "moral" thing to do (in which case it wouldn't be calledmurder, probably sacrifice). After the act, you could say what you liked,but you must make a conscious decision on whether or not your society willcondone your act, so as to evaluate the consequences to yourself, includinghow you will feel about it (remember your feelings have been sociallyimbued).Jeff.I keep trying to write a book of ideas in two paragraphs and it just comesout disorganised garble!

To the degree that relativism is a more accurate decription of thetruth than is objectivism, it provides more power and ability tocontrol events.Assuming, for the moment, that morals _are_ relative, then tworelativists can recognize that neither has a lock on the absolutetruth and they can proceed to negotiate a workable compromise thatproduces the desired results.Assuming that there is an absolute morality, two disagreeing objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right; thereis no room for compromise.

How true. This claim wouldlend substantial support to the notion that religions are actuallyseamless virtual realities.Does god exist or not? To us, this question is a true dichotomy.Can god know a reason for her existence? If she is omniscient, thenshe must know this. There is a philosophical problem whether anythingcan exist without a time frame - for instance, if it were possible toobserve our universe from 'outside', in the neverness surroundingthis universe, it would never have existed. Thus, we are faced with a trilemma:1) God 'meta-exists', and from this meta-existing perspective shecreated existence, the Universe and everything. This implies that the universe was not actually formed of nothing, whichis precisely what many theories of cosmogenesis (Lizhi & Shuxian: Creation of the Universe) say. This 'nothingness' is not empty enough,it is not the transcendental nothingness where there is no existence,until (there is no 'when' yet, but never mind) god, the source ofall existence, started to play. I fail to see the difference betweenthese two forms of nothingness, though. If there isn't one, it mightbe god is not necessary for creation.It is obvious that the levels of 'meta-existence' are not necessarilylimited to god, there might be a 'meta-god' on some other level.2) God exists, and has always existed (she has a timescale, whichis different from our own). This sounds sensible, but it is difficultto conceive how she could know why she exists - a being whichhas always existed, and is infinitely conscious of itself, canremember that she has always been the same, and perhaps know herselfcompletely, but she cannot know why she exists, and how she knowseverything she knows. Would a knowledge of how a being with a personality (a subjective viewpoint) knows everything be thisbeing's knowledge? A conscious being conscious of everything isactually a contradiction in terms - it means that god is onlyconscious of herself, since we, and the whole universe, arealready incorporated in her mental models, thoroughly modelled.Actually, a conscious being conscious of only itself is notconscious at all. 3) God is herself the Existence. This is nothing more than an Orwellianredefinition of the word existence. A logical consequence of thisstatement is that god is actually _all_ existence. I think this isalso called a form of pantheism.: If this: being declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has: defined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed,: He is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically: self-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an: objective sense.In a reality god is supposed to have created, I cannot believe inher, is that my fault or the creator's fault? God gave me freedomof choice, but nevertheless knows what I will opt for, is it fairplay on her side?If god has a conscious mind, in any sense, she has a point of view.I'd say she is entitled to her opinions about me, but I still insistthat any harm she might attempt to do to me will be met with resistance and disapproval. : If God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective.No, an objective standard means something independent on _any_subjective viewpoint, _including_ god's point of view. : If human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that: standard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative: morality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous,: meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to: misunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to: meet that standard is therefore objectively determined.What standard? My morality (and my conscience)  disagrees with the'standards' of the Bible. Which one to ignore? How to interpretany divine standard? There is a great discrepancy even among Christians on this. For instance, the Bible does not condemnfemale homosexuality - why many Christians do, thinking god doesn'taccept it anyway?Bill, to reject a concept of any objective morality does not make theterm nebulous. Morality is the subjective aspect of societal behaviour,something we can change, and something that _must_ change whensocieties change. It might be some basic concepts are hard-wiredin our brains by evolution, but in the end, we must decide ourselves.I don't think people need religion to keep them moral; thinking goes beyond threat of punishment. : Just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is: infinitely malleable, doesn't mean that the objective standard itself: doesn't exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural: norm, or the preferred conduct of "decent" people, making it seem: subjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard.I've yet to see an objective standard that is a) universally applicable (today and tomorrow)b) universally acceptable (not against our own concepts of what ismoral and what isn't): Ironically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true: nature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being: contrary to human nre, oppressive and severe. This may be due as: much to our amoral inclinations as to the standard itself, but like it: or not, it's there.I don't think Christian morality is of a particularly high standard,although it is probably a reflection of high morals of the time,and much of it is still applicable. The problem is that I can'tagree with it all. This is not a question of comforting myconscience with a thought that "I won't be responsible with whatI do", as Christians would put it. My conscience is in an irreconcilableconflict with the Bible on homosexuality, Paul's idea of women'srole in marriage etc... and the whole idea that I should believein someone I got no help from in this task.Petri-- ___. .'*''.*        Petri Pihko    kem-pmp@          Mathematics is the Truth.!___.'* '.'*' ' .

How about these two:1.  Some of the survivors claimed that BD members poured fuel along thecorridors and set fire to it.  The speed at which the fire spreadis not inconsistent with this claim.2.  There was certainly a fire which killed most of the people in the compound.There is a very very good possibility that the FBI did not start thisfire.  This is a good reason to believe that the BD's did.3.  Even if the BD's were not contemplating suicide, it is very possible thatDavid Koresh was convinced (and thus convinced the others) that thiswas not suicide.  It was the fulfilment of a profecy of some sort.There are three possibilities other than the BD's self destruction:A.  They are not dead, but escaped via bunker,etc.  From reports of theinadequacies of the tunnels and the bodies found, I would rate thisas highly unlikely.B.  The fire was started by an FBI accident.  This is possible, but it would befoolish of us to declare this outright until more evidence can back it.Sure, it's possible that the armored vehicle knocked down a lanternwhich started the fire (why was there a lit lantern in the middle ofthe day near the edge of the complex?).  It's anecdotal evidence thathas been contradicted by other escapees.C.  The fire was started on purpose by the FBI.  This has been suggested bysome on the NET, and I would rate this possibility as utterlyludicrous.  This is what we in "sci.skeptic" would call an"extraordinary claim" and won't bother refuting unless someone givesany good evidence to back it up.So we are left with two reasonable possibilities.  That the fire was an FBIaccident and that the fire was started by the BD.  I find the latter morelikely based on the evidence I've seen so far.-- *Isaac Kuo (isaackuo@math.berkeley.edu)*       ___** _____/_o_\\_____*Twinkle, twinkle, little .sig,*(==(/_______\\)==)*Keep it less than 5 lines big.* \\==\\/     \\/==/

The BranchDividians may have been nutty (my general opinion of all religious people),but tax evasion and illegal possesion of firearms are certainly not groundsfor destroying a people.The killing of the four BATF agents was surey a dispicable act, but that wasan escalation of the confrontation which the BATF started.  War is badprecisely because of humanity's tendancy for escalation.  That principleapplies to all cases of warfare- whether it's between nuclear superpowers,feuding families or fledgling religious groups and our federal govt.  Whywas warfare chosen as the course of action when patience and subtlety wouldalso have worked?  Why is the petty letter of the law more important thanpeoples' lives and religious beliefs?  Perhaps the supposed professionals inour federal law inforcement agencies are just plain stupid.It was interesting to watch the 700 club today.  Pat Robertson said that the"Branch Dividians had met the firey end for worshipping their false god." Healso said that this was a terrible tragedy and that the FBI really blew it. However, I still feel that he's forgetting that every major religion in theworld had a similarly humble 'cult-status' beginning- even, and perhapsespecially, christianity.  It is perhaps worthwhile to consider that theBranch Dividians' apocalyptic prophecies have been fulfilled.

Your paragraph above seems to indicate there might be.The OED gives the etymology of "sibyl" as coming from the ancient Greek sigma iota beta upsilon lambda lambda alpha ( S i b ih l l a )which is claimed to come from the Doric sigma iota omicron beta upsilon lambda lambda alpha ( s i o b ih l l a )which (if I read it properly) in turn came from the Attican (Athenian)theta epsilon omicron beta omicron upsilon lambda eta ( th eh o b o ih l ae )I don't know much about Attis, but it wouldn't surprise me to learn thatthis God was tied to the Athenian capitalAlpha tau tau iota kappa upsilon sigma(a t t i k u s)The OED does not list any etymology for "Cybele" since that is a propper noun,but I suggest that the Greek spelling of that word would be much closer tothe anticedants of Sibyl than the two words are now. Perhaps "Cybele" is aFrench or Latin spelling?

Humans do math, because they value what math can do.>That does not mean that math is based on values - unless you claim>that computers (or even unconstructed physical systems) which instantiate>mathematical systems also are based on values. The point is that when we recognize these "instantiations" of mathematicalsystems, we do so because we VALUE being able to describe and perhaps even to control these instantiations. There is always a driving purpose behindthought -- a motive, if you will. Sometimes that motive is relatively "pure", e.g. pursuit of knowledge, othertimes it's "impure", e.g. pursuitof money, or of physical pleasure. But it's always there. And even when itis a "pure" pursuit of knowledge, presumably one pursues knowledge in orderto personally grow, develop, advance to a higher plane of being. So thereis still an element of acquisition, of reaching, of grasping, even in theapproach of the "detached, objective" scientist. >>Now if we're valuing procedures subjectively, and science is a procedure,>>science cannot be valued non-subjectively.

There are two sensesin which we can say that the phenomenon of "the working of the DES chip" is value-based:1) Because there is bound to be some reason why we built the DES   chip and started it running in the first placeand2) Because the very notion/definition/concept of "works" has value   associated with itThe first is a CAUSAL linkage -- we want it to work, therefore we CAUSE it to work. That is rather a mundane interpretation. The second, however, is a more subtle and deeper PHENOMENOLOGICAL linkage -- that the attribute "works" is itself, as everything else, presented to the human consciousness as a _valued_ fact, not just a fact-in-itself. You are perhaps justified in shooting down the causal linkage, but you have not begun to address the phenomenological linkage.>Suns in unpopulated solar systems shine without being blessed by your>values.

It is >discriminatory that I cannot make that choice, and so you must pay for it."  >That a person has a right to make a choice does not imply legally or >otherwise that someone else should Foot the Bill [sic] for that choice.Ok, look.  It's like this.  We *are* footing the bill.  Maybe they willtake choice A.  Maybe they will take choice B.  Maybe they will take choiceC.  They can't afford any *one* of them.  If they take choice A we'd haveto pay them, say $5.  If they take choice B it would cost us $20.  If theytake choice C it will cost us $20 now and a hell of a lot more for the next18 years.  Which one sounds the most realistic for us to be willing to payfor?  Now some people happen not to like choice A.  Other people happennot to like choice C (paying for it, that is).  C has been around and paidfor for years.  Even though it means we spend a lot of money, we can't inconscience refuse to pay for it.  Now A has been around and is perfectlylegal, but it hasn't been funded in the past.  Now A is going to be fundedbut some people object.  They don't like the idea of their tax money goingto pay for choice A.  So we could refuse to fund A at all.  Then thosewomen who can't afford any of those choices will be forced to take choiceB or C, which will cost *all of us* more money.  Most of us don't see anyreason at all why *more money* should be spent to the effect of *removingpersonal choice* from some women.  The alternative is to fund A if that iswhat the mother chooses.  We will also still fund B and even C if *that*is what the mother chooses.  However, some women will certainly choose A,and that will then save us $15 we otherwise would have had to spend.  Your"taxes" are not being raised to fund a choice you object, they are being*lowered* because we will fund a choice that is *legal*, despite yourobjections to it.  (Actually, your taxes are not really going to go down,as I'm sure you would point out.  But the amount that is saved in thatarea can help out in another--like our massive debt.)>>If you disagree then give us some "reasons".  Given that abortion is>>*LEGAL* and the right to abortion is supported by the majority of the>>population ...>>...it is not justifiable to refuse abortions to women who can not afford>>them, who will simply require even greater funds for the delivery you>>would force upon them.  I refuse to pay *more taxes* to remove choice>>from those women just because you object to a legal medical procedure.>WHAT?>I say objection to the procedure is irrelevant.  Uncle Bill doesn't pay for >breast augmentation, facelifts, etc...  Why abortions?  It's elective >surgery!  Those other procedures you mention only cost money.  There is no savingsin other procedures that would be required down the road without them.(In fact, there could be additional costs down the road *because* of them.)This is quite different from the case of abortion.>As for your argument, you are enticing a young girl to kill a baby by making >it affordable and refusing to make the alternative affordable too, SO YOU >ARE JUST AS GUILTY OF REMOVING A CHOICE BY WITHHOLDING FUNDS!  Think about >it.  A poor girl is pregnant and abortions are federally funded, what's she >gonna do.  What choice have YOUR PLANS given her.  Your kind of double->talk really makes me ill.This is bullshit.  We are *not* refusing "to make the alternative affordabletoo".  If we refused to pay for the more expensive choice of birth, *then*your statement would make sense.  But that is not the case, so it doesn't.If Clinton tried to block funding for pre-natal care and delivery (or leftit out of his health-care plan), I would certainly object.  I would also bequite surprised.>"Pro-choice".  Ha!  Pro-Abortion really fits in your case.Yes, but probably not your definition of it, or for the reasons you think.>If you're gonna fund one choice, you have to fund them all, at the very >least.YOU STUPID FUCK!  *WE DO* want to fund *all* the choices.  *YOU* are theone who wants to *NOT* fund all the choices.>        IMHO if we fund the adoption choice right, (meaning not just >throwing money at it but cutting costs, esp. legal costs) we won't need >abortion anymore.Your humble opinion is still wrong.  Even with easy adoption, there is stillthe fact that pregnancy takes several months.  Months in which a young womancould need to be getting an education.  (like finishing High School, enteringcollege, finishing college, getting a job...things that are much harder todo if you have to "take a break" for a few months...things that have a massiveimpact on her future productivity.)>>have a "right to life".

Or how about people we >just don't like, since we can't have a conversation with them...You *can* have a conversation with the "mentally incompetant".  And eventhough *you* personally may refuse to have a conversation with "peopleyou just don't like", it is still *possible* for others to have a conversationwith them.  It is *not* possible for *anyone* to have a conversation witha fetus.>>They are not biologically independent.  >Nor was my son at the age of 6 weeks.  He was breastfed, and would not take>a bottle.  Just what does "biologically independent" mean?  I'll be happy to >punch any definition full of loopholes.He was still biologically independent.  At least to the same extent you arenow.  He consumed nutrients and digested them in the normal manner.  Hebreathed his own air.  A fetus on the other hand, gets it's nutrients alreadydigested by the mother.  It gets its oxygen from the mother as well.  Thatis not biologically independent.>>Their>>awareness is questionable.  >Aha! You admit it is questionable.  Yet you are willing to kill it, even if >it *may* be very aware.  I suggest you re-think your viewpoint.Awareness is only *part* of what makes a "member of society".  It is theminimal conceivable requirement, yet many people seem to think that somethingwithout awareness could still be important enough to justify the suffereingof a true member of society.  I keep asking, but I still haven't seen a realjustification for why the life of a non-sentient creature should be worth thesuffering of a sentient being.  (I haven't read every response on the threadsI've been asking on, yet, so we'll see if I see one later.)>>They have no experiences in the "real world" to make up a personality.>This is also true of quite a few Unix programmers.

When a terrorist action takes place in the middle east, it is always played  up as an Islamic Terrorist.  However, when the a Serbian terrorist attacks  the Croations, its not a Christian terrorist, its just a terrorist.I have often tried to explain this to some close friends who believe  the press, that Islam is somehow tied to violence.  Often times you hear  things like "They just don't value human life like we do..." and so on.  I was wondering if anyone out there had any suggestions for how we can  change this image, or how I can help my friends to see that this is just   hype.

Allow me to give you an example: I thinkthat knowing the byte order on IBM 3090s is pretty much worthless(I don't care to know it) but I would be quite prepared tonote as valuable (i.e. accurate) the claim that it was Big-endianif it was shown to be so (like, by showing me the manual.)> And _no-one_ points>out an _unimportant_ difference, _except_ to say that it's unimportant.>"Important", "useful", "worthy", etc. are all words with evaluative>power, quite different from evaluating an expression.

Choice of problems DOEShave to do with those factors, but they are orthogonal toevaluating (for accuracy) solutions to chosen problems.>#>The concept of a DES box which can be assumed to work as you describe in >#>the absence of an assumption of objective reality is incoherent.

Frank, you are attempting to inject "goodness" judgements where thereare only "accuracy" judgements, by essentially punning on the word'value' which has both meanings. "useful" is a goodness judgement."Reasonable" is an accuracy judgement. They are not the samething at all. ("Useful in making some conclusion" is an accuracyjudgement again, I'm afraid.) Sorry, Frank, but all you're doing isusing the ambiguity of English to obfuscate the issue. IF youmean to say that science is based on value (accuracy) judgements,I have no problem with that. If you mean to say that it's basedon value (goodness) judgements, that's nonsense. By contrast,morality is clearly based on goodness judgements.-Ekr-- Eric Rescorla                                     ekr@eitech.com        "What we've got here is failure to communicate."

I am leaving out all "proofs" of Emery's which rely on quoting thebible as proof.  Circular reasoning, etc.  There have been occasionsalready stated many times for later generations of Xtians to change,edit, or otherwise alter the bible to fit their political gospel.And if we accept the bible as true just because the bible says itis true, then (to be fair) we have to do the same to the Bhagavad-Gitaand the Koran, both of which contradict the bible.Enough said./(emery)/Yet we have no reason to believe these disciples to be immoral and dishonest./We have no historic information that would lead us to the conclusion that/these people were not God-fearing people who sincerely and whole-heartedly/believed that the resurrection of their Lord Jesus was a real event./And for what gain would they lie?  To make a stand at that time meant /persecution, imprisonment, and perhaps even death.Again, this is only the biblical account and there is no independent proofof any of this happening.  It just isn't there.Besides, simply being sincere or willing to die for your faith does notmake your faith correct.  There are Muslims dying in Bosnia right now;does the fact that they are willing to die for Islam mean that Islam isthe correct religion?(emery)/History bears out the persecution of Christians.  Roman historian, Cornelius /Tacitus, Govenor of Asia, in A.D. 112, writing of Nero's reign, alluded to /the torture of Christians in Rome:All you have proven is that these people were tortured for their faith.  Thatdoes not prove that their faith is true or correct; it just means that theywere sincere in their beliefs. Being willing to die for what you believe doesn't make your belief the truth.It's not that easy.  And minority religions have always suffered torture;Muslims suffer torture and harassment in India and Bosnia today.  All religionsare harassed in China today.  You haven't proven anything so far./(emery)/With all the suffering and persecution that it meant to be a believer, it/would be quite probable that at least one of those in the supposed conspiracy/would come forward and confess that the whole thing was a big hoax.  Not if they didn't believe that it was a hoax.  /(emery)/Yet not one did.  It seems rather reasonable that the disciples did not make/up the resurrection but sincerely believed that Jesus had actually risen/from the dead; especially in light of the sufferings that came upon those/who believed.The followers of Muhammad firmly believed in the miracles that the Koransays Muhammad performed.  They were attacked and slaughtered for theirbeliefs.  They didn't denounce Muhammad or Islam.  If you are correct,then that means Islam is the true faith.You see how stupid your proofs are?

What is the source of this pseudo-doctrine? Who is> the pseudo-teacher? Who is the Great Deceiver?OK, here's at least one Christian's answer:Jesus was a JEW, not a Christian.  In this context Matthew 5:14-19 makessense.  Matt 5:17 "Do not think that I [Jesus] came to abolish the Law orthe Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill."  Jesus livedunder the Jewish law.  However, He was the culmination of the promisesof the Prophets.  He came to *fulfill* the prophecies and fully obeyGod's purposes.Verse 18 says "For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth passaway, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law,until all is accomplished."  The key to this verse IMHO is the last phrase.  Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, "accomplished" what the Law was supposed to accomplish.  Verse 19:  "Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments,and so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven;but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in thekingdom of heaven."  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish people about living lives under the law, this makes sense.In general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he must have received about "doing away with the Law."  That was not Jesus' intent at all.  He had come to earth to live the Law as it should be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his people all the way back to Eve [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your heel, but *He* will bruise his head.]  Jesus appeared to be "doing away with the Law" because he did not honor the traditions of men as equal to the Law of God.  He regularly locked horns with the religious leaders of the day because he would not conform to *their* rules, only God's Law.In the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law and defending himself against his accusors.  Almost the entire Sermon on the Mount (Matt. 5-7) is dedicated to helping the Jewish people understand the true intent of the Law, sweeping away the clutter which had been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions.In Galatians 3:23-26, Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the Law in this way:[23] But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.  [24] Therefore the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be justified by faith.  [25]  But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.  [26] For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.I believe this says that after Christ was revealed, the Law had served it's purpose, i.e. "our tutor to lead us to Christ," andnow, "we are no longer under a tutor."  The law has been "fulfilled" as Christ said he would do.God, the author of the old Law, and the Christ/Man, Jesus, are the samepersonality.  Therefore, the old Law and the new Testament (the "lastwill and testament" of Jesus) are based on the same moral principles. It makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law arere-expressed in Christianity. On the other hand, now that the Law has fulfilled it's purpose and Christians relate to God through Christ, not the Law, it also makes sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to represent the "mysteries" of this new relationship.  i.e. Baptism representing Christ's death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-8),The Lord's supper as a memorial to His sacrifice (I Cor. 11:26), andSunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection (Matt 28:1ff,Acts 20:7)OK, That's one Christian's explanation.  I don't claim to have allthese issues completely settled even in my own mind and I welcomeother Christians to offer other alternatives.Please excuse the long posting.

I have been following this businesssince it started 52 days ago.  The Branch Davidians have occupied the Mt.Carmel location for some years, and their neighbors (you know, the peoplenext door) have said to a man, that the BD folks were quiet and neverbothered anybody.There were some defector from the BD who alleged child abuse within themovement, but how does this bring in the Feds? In particular what interestwould ATF have in child abuse. O.K. It was the allegation of possesingillegal automatic weapons.  A search warrant could have been obtained(properly) only on probable cause. This means that some evidence that anillegal auto weapon was shipped in, or an illegal kit for convertingsemi-auto weapons to full automatic was purchased or shipped.In either case, how does this require an NO-KNOCK warrent, with a bunch ofmacho hot dog assholes busting into the place *without* identifyingthemselves. Milleniests tend to be a bit paranoid anyway. It is nosurprise they shot when invaded. Hell I am not a religious extremist and Imight have done the same myself. If the DEA busted into my house bymistake without identifying themselve and I had a gun in my hand, I wouldshoot first and wonder later.So if it was illegal guns, the ATF should have gotten a normal warrant(how can you flush a 50 calibre machine gun down the toilet?) andpresented it in a peaceful normal way. David Koresh has had brushes withthe law, even standing trial for attempted murder in which he wasacquitted. In every prior brush with the law, Koresh and his people actedpeacibly. There was no prior action on the part of the BD folks toindicate that they were any danger to society.NOTE: The question of whether the BD people were religious extremists orslight daft is totally irrelevant. It is *not* against the law to belooney or zany.Look and learn folks. And be VERY afraid.Conan the Libertarian-- "If you can't love the Constitution, then at least hate the Government"

First get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching to usabout "the only true God," whom you interpret according to your own likesand dislikes, but whose image I cannot reconcile with what I know aboutHim myself.  I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for otherfaiths, believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ, but in a differentway or fashion than your own.  Not that it really matters, the missionand progress of the lds church will go on, boldly and nobly, and no mobor opponent can stop the work from progressing, until it has visitedevery continent, swept every clime, and sounded in every ear.#  This is really a red herring. It doesn't address any issue raised, but#  rather, it seeks to obfuscate. The fact that some groups try to read#  something into the Bible, doesn't change what the Bible teaches.Sigh.  "What the Bible teaches"?  Or: "what the bible teaches according toRobert Weiss and co.?"  I respect the former, I reject the latter withoutthe remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus.  On the contrary.  And bythe way, I do respect your interpretations of the Bible, I even grant youbeing a Christian (following your own image of Him), as much as I am aChristian (following my own image of Him in my heart).(...)#  Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of#  Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' I don't#  think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon. That is not the#  issue.  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this#  subject is the real issue. The indication from Rick is that they may#  certainly be.The issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis-represent or ridicule the lds church.  The issue of "official doctrine"is obviously very important.  McConkie's views have been controversial(e.g. "The Seven Deadly Heresies" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best,or erroneous at worst ("blacks not to receive the priesthood in thisdispensation").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuablecontribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personalinterpretations (his book "Mormon Doctrine" is oftentimes referred toas "McConkie's Bible" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I ratherlook to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books!(The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkiewas a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom ofGod than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepteddoctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation andspeculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his mostbiased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than thetrash coming from your proverbial pen.  I'm somewhat appalled that I haveallowed myself to sink as low as you in this posting...=============================Robert Weisspsyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.eduCasper C.

The next day, FBI agents were insisting that they saw Davidianssetting the fire. The FBI was also adamantly denying that it was possibletheir battery of the compound's wallks could have accidentally set theblaze, while also saying they hadnt been able to do much investigatingof the site because it was still too hot.

ALink: KSAND -- Private activities on the net.We have reached the point in our society when there are certain crimesthat are so heinous that to merely be accused with them one is automaticlyconsidered guilty and deemed not to have any natural rights much less civil rights. Among these are drug abuse, sexual perversion, and political incorrectness.Today Billary accused Koresh of having SEX with infants. He had been accused ofa number of differing crimes (inconsistantly) over the last two months, but this is the first time I have heard that one. I had heard child abuse butthis is somewhat stronger.It is fairly obvious that Koresh  was hiding behind the children; and ironiclyconsidering his apocalyptic dread, believed enough in the American People'sinherent goodness to believe he was protected.It is truly amazing that all these people who 60 days ago had never heard of the Branch Davidian now believe that he was suicidal, crazy, a child abuser and a immenant danger to others based solely on what the Government spokespersonshad said. Remember that these people have an awful lot to loose if it is foundthat they have screwed up. But they don't have as much to lose as David Koresh and his followers lost.For in our society as it stands murder is not one of the heinous crimes.---------------------------------------------------------------------cutter@gloster.via.mind.org (chris)     All jobs are easy                                      to the person who                                     doesn't have to do them.

Theidea being that in a just cause God will supply amunition "fear notfor the Lord himself shall place the arrows in your bow". Neat eh? TheBATF agents were thus definitively shot by the will of God himself. Ican't see why they needed the million rounds of ammo though in thatcase.If you have some Koresh material that hasn't gone to the net then pleasesend it to me.

I want the real Mcoy, the one the Fedsdiscoverd on the third day in a box with seven seals and are suppressing.I will editorialize for the benefit of the net to produce a "definitive"history.

Letterman:  "Are youlike me?  Do you like science and medicine?").Difference is that science is based on consensus.  The points above arewell made,  and obviously there is some discussion as to what thefacts are in some cases.  But if you are willing to play along withthe definitions,  you too can hit the jackpot.  Science also tends touse the principle of totality (vs locality).  You can always look at asmall part of the macrocosm,  yet those miniature pieces are still apart of the total essence.  So the facts to observe are those whichpertain to what questions you're asking.  You may place a value on thequestions,  but in many case,  they are being asked just for the sakeof asking.  And you can say that you're looking at a signal instead oflistening to noise,  but the beauty of science is that it takes bothinto account (the totality aspect).  For science to say that light isa wave and NOT a particle (or vice versa) would be to ignore the totalessence that is light (which is based upon the agreed upon definitions).Why even have definitions?  Why agree upon them?  Well, to communicate insuch a way so that many will understand what you are saying.  Where thecuriosity and drive come from I don't honestly know.I hope I haven't rambled too much.

I hereby state that I am not claiming or denying membership inany Order, fraternity etc. with or without the word "Rosicrucian" in the name of the organization. I only claim having done some "homework" :-)     This is intended as a friendly article and if at times it seemsdifferent, it's my lack of writing skills showing, nothing else. Heck,English may be my second language! (And then again maybe not by now :-)     I proceed:>>I had an ehum, interesting experience with the Rosicrucians, or at>least Rosicrucians of some sort last Sunday.>     Let's start with the name "Rosicrucian". I took me a long time to cometo the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a"rosicrucian" body and BEING *a* ROSICRUCIAN. So when you say that you metsome 'rosicrucians' you mean "members of a group that calls themselvesrosicrucian". At least that is what your observation suggests :-)     I'd prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the LectoriumRosicrucianum, only because they may be confused, by some readers of thisnewsgroup, with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based (the USA Jurisdiction) inSan Jose, CA; this being the RC org with the most members (last time Ilooked). Of course, "most members" does not *necessarily* mean "best".     Anyway, the Lectorium Rosicrucianum claims theydescend (at least in part) from what was the "Gold-und-Rosenkreuz" (Goldenand Rosy Cross), from the 18th century. There were two "Golden and RosyCross", the first (chronologically) more alchemical, the second withMasonic tinges, but their history is the subject of a complete chapter :-).     "You'll have to trust me" when I tell you that if thatlecture/class/whatever had been presented by AMORC, it is unlikely that youwould have had the same impression, i.e., you'd probably have had apositive impression more likely than a negative one, IMHO. >The first guy also said that the R:s are a mystical Christian order, and>that they base their teachings on the teachings of the Kathars>(English?) from the thirteenth century.>     Again, instead of R:s, it should be "Lectorium Rosicrucianum" :-). Itis curious to know that 3 other RC 'orders' (in the USA) claim to be *non-sectarian*.     The Cathars were a 'heretic' christian sect that directly challengedthe 'authority' of the medieval catholic church. They flourished during the12th century, century which saw the religious zeal expressed in thecrusades and also the growing disillusion with the catholic church and theworldly ways of its clerics. It was largely in response to the church'sunseemly pomp and splendor that Catharism took root, first in northernItaly, then throughout the south of France.>What made me a bit suspicious, was the way they first said that we all>contained something divine, and could find our way back to divinity,>then that we couldn't become divine as the persons we are currently,>but if we worked really hard we would reach eternal bliss.     I don't see nothing *fundamentally* wrong with "us containingsomething divine"... And yes I don't like phrases like "eternal bliss"either! :-)>How to robotize people and brainwash...>     For a moment I thought you were referring to Madison Ave :-)(Madison avenue in New York City is where the most influential (read$$$) *commercial* advertising is produced here in the USA :-)Peace,TonyBTW, I have read the intro letters of the LRC which they will mail you freeof charge.

If theyare arrested they call their lawyer, post bail and hope for a pleabargain.  If they pull a gun and shoot a cop during a raid they willbe charged with first degree murder if they survive the raid.  Drugdealers have guns for protection from their customers and othercriminals, not to shoot cops.  Cops are shot on no-knock drug raidsbecause the criminals aren't aware that they are cops.No-knock raids on homes occupied by non-criminals are more likely toend in disaster.  Mom and Pop citizen _KNOW_ that they have notcommitted any crime, they KNOW that anyone breaking into their housecannot be a cop because they have done nothing wrong.  If they havethe means to defend themselves they may because they KNOW that thehousebreakers are criminals not cops.  Cops and homeowners may die.The first reports from Waco stated that the ATF had a warrant tosearch for illegal weapons and also an arrest warrant if the illegalweapons were found.  In this case the no-knock warrant was not calledfor.  It is difficult to flush a gun down the toilet.  The ATF couldhave surrounded the compound.  A marked police car could have drivenup to the entrance and uniformed officers could have knocked andserved the warrant usual way.  It this had happened and and Koreshrefused the warrant or drove the cops off at gun point then most ofthe t.p.g folks would have kept quiet.--Rod Anderson  N0NZO         | "I do not think the United States governmentBoulder, CO                 | is responsible for the fact that a bunch ofrcanders@nyx.cs.du.edu      | fanatics decided to kill themselves"satellite  N0NZO on ao-16   |        Slick Willie the Compassionate

I have to consult my city and inform them that it's fromnow a fishing village.

But they have been systematically           IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years!                The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's comprehensive           GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he           calls the "Reciprocal System", is built on two fundamental           postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of           space and time:                    (1) "The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE           component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE           UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME."                    (2) "The physical universe conforms to the relations of           ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are           ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN."                    From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE           Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of           translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward           SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light           (which Larson called "UNIT VELOCITY" and "THE NATURAL           DATUM").                      At each step in the development, Larson was able to           MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the           REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles           [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star           clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white           dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET           DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY           BURSTS).                          And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom,           Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility           and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of           matter.                All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy           complex mathematics, in his books.               BOOKS of Dewey B. Larson                         The following is a complete list of the late Physicist           Dewey B. Larson's books about his comprehensive GENERAL           UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe.  Some of the early           books are out of print now, but still available through           inter-library loan.                    "The Structure of the Physical Universe" (1959)                    "The Case AGAINST the Nuclear Atom" (1963)                   "Beyond Newton" (1964)                    "New Light on Space and Time" (1965)                    "Quasars and Pulsars" (1971)                    "NOTHING BUT MOTION" (1979)                     [A $9.50 SUBSTITUTE for the $8.3 BILLION "Super                                                             Collider".]                     [The last four chapters EXPLAIN chemical bonding.]               "The Neglected Facts of Science" (1982)                     "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION" (1984)                    [FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL astrophysical                                                            mysteries.]                      "BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER" (1988)               All but the last of these books were published by North           Pacific Publishers, P.O. Box 13255, Portland, OR  97213, and           should be available via inter-library loan if your local           university or public library doesn't have each of them.                Several of them, INCLUDING the last one, are available           from: The International Society of Unified Science (ISUS),           1680 E. Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the           organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.            They have other related publications, including the quarterly           journal "RECIPROCITY".                     Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background                   Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer           (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he           died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in           Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He           developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the           physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE           chemical properties based only on the elements used.                    Larson's lack of a fancy "PH.D." degree might be one           reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is           NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider           to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same           time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX           physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer,           well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC           ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC..                     Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally           test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.            He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER           researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in           many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER.                    A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX           physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking           for a "unified field theory" that works, but have been           IGNORING one for over 30 years now!                    "Modern physics" does NOT explain the physical universe           so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of           quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who           agree.  And remember that "epicycles", "crystal spheres",           "geocentricity", "flat earth theory", etc., ALSO once SEEMED           to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG.                        Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior,           was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or           still is) President of Larson's organization, "THE           INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE", and Editor of           their quarterly Journal "RECIPROCITY".  He moved to           Minneapolis after retiring.               "Super Collider" BOONDOGGLE!                         I am AGAINST contruction of the "Superconducting Super           Collider", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS           WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of "scientific"           value.                    Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the           comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist           Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY           particles ("mesons", "hyperons", ALLEGED "quarks", etc.)           which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab,           Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are           CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly           disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible           with their environment.                    A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a           few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not           seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE           CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW!                    Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3           BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for           this WASTED money?!                         Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed           location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some           kind of "fire ants" eating the insulation off underground           cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water           with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of           the "Supercollider"?!                              Naming the "Super Collider" after Ronald Reagon, as           proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be           named after a leading particle PHYSICIST.                 LARSONIAN Anti-Matter                         In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the           physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of           opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more           to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the           photons of which they are made, in relation to the           vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light,           which Larson calls "Unit Velocity" and the "Natural Datum".                     In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of           MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet,           the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their           respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each           other.                      In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical           universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension           of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our           MATERIAL half.                  LARSONIAN Relativity                         The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury           has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the           rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this           advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational           perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter,           etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to           help "prove" Einstein's "General Theory of Relativity".                    But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results           CLOSER to the 43 seconds than "General Relativity" can, by           INSTEAD using "SPECIAL Relativity".  In one or more of his           books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH           ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury.                    Larson TOTALLY REJECTED "General Relativity" as another           MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of "Special           Relativity", including the parts about "mass increases" near           the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on           doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than           1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT,           although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.).                     In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the           physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead           of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured           from our material half of the physical universe.  The one           dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low           relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are           NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and           the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR.           [Larson often used the term "COORDINATE TIME" when writing           about this.]                         In regard to "mass increases", it has been PROVEN in           atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near           the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is           ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists           are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory,           mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is           actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS           BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.            The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward           SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of           the so-called "Big Bang" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL           FANTASY).                                                             THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book "THE UNIVERSE           OF MOTION", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific           Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456           pages, indexed, hardcover.                    It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL           UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that           author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago.                    It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical           mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and           multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of           the "3-degree" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white           dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc..                    It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL           looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with           OPEN MINDS!                    The following is an example of his Theory's success:           In his first book in 1959, "THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL           UNIVERSE", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING           GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding           them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's           comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he           had an immediate related explanation for them also.                GAMMA-RAY BURSTS               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching           their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were           originally thought to originate from "neutron stars" in the           disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in           Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions           uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT           correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of           directional coincidence).                    Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the           GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by           the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of           his book "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION", published in 1984, the           gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the           ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls           the "Cosmic Sector".  Because of the relationship between the           anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and           the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can           pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at           random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do           not correspond with known objects, and come from all           directions uniformly.)                    I wonder how close to us in space a source location           would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most           life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to           stop it!                    Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which           are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were           actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS!               LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation                         About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the           vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox           astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory           theory about how they form or why there are so many of them.                    But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY           CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of           the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey           B. Larson.                    I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is           detailed in Chapter 7 of his book "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"           and in some of his other books.                    First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate           energy by "fusion".  A small fraction comes from slow           gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE           ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each           element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the           element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal           temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and           absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually           reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and           lighter elements.                    When the internal temperature of the star reaches the           destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I           SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron           present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms           and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some           of his books [better than I can].                    When the star explodes, the lighter material on the           outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less           than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center           portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to           the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The           explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and           it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN           SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while.                    Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall           back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown           outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The           material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a           WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward           the "MAIN SEQUENCE" from opposite directions on the H-R           Diagram.                    The chances of the two masses falling back into the           exact same location in space, making a single lone star           again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY           system, orbiting each other.                     According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE           DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the           material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown           outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to           MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about "degenerate matter", "neutron           stars", "black holes", etc..               LARSONIAN Solar System Formation               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the           exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single           white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL "mini" white dwarf           stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably           still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected           by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS!                      In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all           this information, and other principles of his comprehensive           GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive           his own version of Bode's Law.                     "Black Hole" FANTASY!               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently           completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO "black           holes" merging together into a SINGLE "black hole", and           concluded that the new "black hole" would have MORE MASS than           the sum of the two original "black holes".                    Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED           FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of "black           holes", etc.!                    After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about           his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical           universe, especially his book "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION", it is           clear to me that "black holes" are NOTHING more than           MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is           just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the "black           hole" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want           to "prove" their theory.                        By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is           being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and           astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical           problem somehow makes him "wiser".  It does NOT!                    I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist           Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread           publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's           Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of           Unified Science).                                         ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection           with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to           find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed.                    I found a possible clue about why they might work on           pages 112-113 of the book "BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER", by           the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of           Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical           universe.  I quote one paragraph:                    "As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development           of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally           different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.            The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It           was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book "NOTHING BUT           MOTION"] that there are physical processes in operation which           produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that,           although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in           many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities           for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are           limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of           free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the           universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged           state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension           space, because they are inherently rotating units of space,           and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open           space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently           in the same location with respect to the natural reference           system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the           stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron,           like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by           the progression of the natural reference system.  All           material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons           similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.            Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later,           whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The           electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth           therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level."                          Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are           also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a           particular frequency (above the "unit" frequency) spinning           around one axis at a particular rate (below the "unit" rate).            ("Unit velocity" is the speed of light, and there are           vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light,           according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the "above" and           "below" labels mixed up.]                    Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of           light!                    If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION           fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these           electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a           charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to           achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge           is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular           frequency (above the "unit" frequency) superimposed on the           rotation of the particle.)                      The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to           confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is           generated in clouds.           SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical           universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has           been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in           his first book "THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE".                    It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan,           and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call           "science" (or "physics", or "astronomy", etc.), as well as           the "scientific" literature and the "education" systems, to           TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have.                    Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many           things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such           as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars.                    Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY           discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals,           in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles           of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses           at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and           elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a           worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed.                              For more information, answers to your questions, etc.,           please consult my CITED SOURCES (especially Larson's BOOKS).                UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this           IMPORTANT partial summary is ENCOURAGED.                                        Robert E.

Read Jesus's own reply to your>question.John 12:24-26: "Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheatfalls onto the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, itproduces much grain.  "He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life inthis world will keep it for eternal life.  "If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there Myservant will be also.  If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor."Why would I want an eternal life if I hate this one?If we were created by a deity, why would that deity not wish us toenjoy what he has given us?Why would I want to live forever?  The challenge in my life is that Iwill die, and that I must give my life the meaning I wish it to havebefore that happens.  My time is here and will someday pass; I will becontent to live on in the memories of my friends, and once they tooare dead, then I will no longer have any reason to exist.In short: even if your deity *does* exist, that doesn't automaticallymean that I would worship it.  I am content to live my own life, andfend for myself, so when I die, I can be proud of the fact that nomatter where I end up, it will be because of *my* actions and *my* choices.If your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this, then so beit.  I would much rather just cease to exist.  But if your god wantsmy respect and my obedience, then it had better earn these; and if itdoes, then they will be very strong and true.>Jesus gives more reasons in John 16:7.

Why do *you* want to?>Why did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesus>says why in John 15:18-25.   That's no mystery either.  "The>world hates him without reason."

Truth is, it's not.  Robert has neverdemonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply; hejust rattles them off day by day.  Some brazenly fly in the face ofcommon sense and reality, and I point these out where I can.But even more than that, even when Christians *do* try to explain theverses in their own words, they do so from a Christian point of view,which is that every human being would want to be a Christian if onlyhe or she understood the Christian message properly, and then allstrife and suffering on the earth would end.  Here's the problem withthat: substitute "Moslem" or "Buddhist" or "Satanist" instead of"Christian", and it means the same thing.Christanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book.

In chemistry, this usually means we must usedifferent models for different situations.

The surfaces are arbitrary, and not really important - what is more important (in chemistry) are the signs of the wavefunctions.Is there something wrong with the representations?-- ___. .'*''.*        Petri Pihko    kem-pmp@          Mathematics is the Truth.!___.'* '.'*' ' .

Are we to>simply assume that you are the only one who really understands it?Rick, I think we can safely say, 1) Robert is not the only personwho understands the Bible, and 2), the leadership of the LDS churchhistoricly never has.  Let's consider some "personal interpretations"and see how much trust we should put in "Orthodox Mormonism", whichcould never be confused with Orthodox Christianity.        In one of his attacks on Christians, the Mormon Apostle Bruce R.McConkie said they "thrash around in...darkness in trying to identifyElohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the promisedMessiah." He also said Christians are wrong to believe "that Jehovah isthe Supreme Deity [God the Father]," and that Christ "came intomortality" as His "Only Begotten" Son. McConkie then stated what Mormonsbelieve today to be the truth about the matter. He said that "Elohim isthe Father" and "Jehovah is the Son."  "Being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists  have gone in defining their three-in-one God, it comes as no surprise  to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to  identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the  promised Messiah. Some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the  Supreme Deity whose Son came into mortality as the Only Begotten. As  with their concept that God is a Spirit, this misinformation about the  Gods of Heaven is untrue. The fact is, and it too is attested by Holy  Writ, that Elohim is the Father, and that Jehovah is the Son who was  born into mortality as the Lord Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah.  (Promised Messiah, p. 100)        Notice that McConkie said the Christians are as wrong abouttheir "three-in-one God" and their belief that "God is a Spirit" as theyare in their understanding of who "Elohim" and "Jehovah" are. Beforeexamining McConkie's attack and its validity, we shall read a few morestatements by McConkie and other Mormon sources concerning the words"Elohim" and "Jehovah." McConkie stated:  "...the chief designation of Christ that has been preserved for us in  the Old Testament, as that ancient work is now published, is the  exalted name-title Jehovah. (Promised Messiah, p. 367)  "_Elohim_, plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted  name-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his  supremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods. (Mormon  Doctrine, p. 224)        Agreeing with McConkie on the question of who "Elohim" and"Jehovah" are, the Apostle James E. Talmage stated:  "_Elohim_, as understood and used in the restored Church of Jesus  Christ, is the name-title of God the Eternal Father, whose firstborn  Son in the spirit is _Jehovah_ -- the Only Begotten in the flesh,  Jesus Christ. (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)        "A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and the Twelve"apostles of the Mormon Church states that "God the Eternal Father...[is]designate[d] by the exalted name-title 'Elohim'..." (Articles of Faith,p. 466) "...Christ in His preexistent, antemortal, or unembodiedstate...was known as Jehovah..." (Articles of Faith, p. 471)        Today Mormon leaders teach that "Elohim" in the OT refers to Godthe Father and "Jehovah" refers to Christ. McConkie attacked Christiansfor saying "Jehovah" can refer to the Father. He stressed that these two"name-titles" should not be changed around so that Christ is called"Elohim" and the Father is called "Jehovah." "...the Father...is Elohim,not Jehovah.... Jehovah is Christ, and Christ is Jehovah; they are oneand the same person." (Promised Messiah, p. 111)        In the OT of the KJV of the Bible, the Hebrew word "Elohim" isused to refer to the true God, false gods and goddesses, and the judgesof Israel. When referring to the true God, "Elohim" is translated with acapital "G." When referring to false gods and goddesses and the judgesof Israel, it is translated with a small "g." It is translated fourtimes as "judges" (Exod. 21:6; 22:8-9), once as "judge" (1 Sam. 2:25),twice as "mighty" (Gen. 23:6; Exod. 9:28), once as "angels" (Ps. 8:5),once as "godly" (Mal. 2:15), once as "great" (Gen. 30:8), and once as"very great." (1 Sam. 14:15)        The word "Jehovah" is the traditional pronunciation of thetetragrammation YHWH or YHVH with the vowel points taken from the word"Adonai."  Many people believe the true pronunciation of thetetragrammation was Yahweh or Yahveh. However, since "Jehovah" ratherthan Yahweh is the word used by Mormonism, this section will also use"Jehovah" instead of Yahweh to examine the validity of the claims ofMormon leaders regarding that name. "Jehovah," unlike "Elohim," is neverused of false gods. It is the personal name of the triune God of theBible. In the KJV, "Jehovah" is rendered primarily "LORD," sometimes"GOD," and rarely "Lord."        Now that we understand something about the words "Elohim" and"Jehovah" and their use by Mormon leaders, we shall consider the ApostleMcConkie's attack on Christians for believing the Father is "Jehovah."In trying to prove that "Jehovah" refers exclusively to Christ, McConkiecited several verses from the Bible. Some of these verses and McConkie'sinterpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right.Remember, McConkie said the Father is not "Jehovah;" He is only"Elohim." The first example we shall consider involves McConkie'sinterpretation of Ps. 110:1. Of this verse he stated:  "Of whom spake David when his tongue was touched by the Holy Spirit  and he testified, "The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?" (Ps. 110:1.) Two  Lords are here involved: one is speaking to the other; one is greater  than the other; one is making provision for the triumph and glory of  the other. Who are they and what message is contained in this  Messianic prophecy?  "What think ye of Christ?" our Lord asked certain of his detractors  toward the end of his mortal ministry. "Whose son is he?" Is Christ  the Son of God or of someone else? Is he to be born of a divine Parent  or will he be as other men -- a mortal son of a mortal father? That he  was to be a descendant of David was a matter of great pride to all the  Jews. And so they answered, "The Son of David."  David's son? Truly he was. But he was more, much more. And so our  Lord, with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture,  asked, "How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, The Lord  said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine  enemies thy footstool? If David then call him Lord, how is he his  son?" That is, if he is only the Son of David, how is it that the  great King, acting under inspiration, calls him Lord and worships him  as such? And we might add: _Who is the other Lord, the one who spake  unto David's Lord?_ Can there be any question as to how Jesus is  interpreting the words of the Psalm? He is saying that it means: '_The  Father said unto the Son, Elohim said unto Jehovah_, sit thou on my  right hand, until after your mortal ministry; then I will raise you up  to eternal glory and exaltation with me, where you will continue to  sit on my right hand forever.' (Promised Messiah, pp. 101-102)  (emphasis added)        Agreeing with the above statement by McConkie, the followingremark in the Mormon pamphlet _What the Mormons Think of Christ, p. 6reads: "The Lord [Elohim, the Father] said unto my Lord [Jehovah, theSon]..." (brackets in original)        McConkie clearly stated that it is "Elohim" the Father who isspeaking to "Jehovah" the Son in this Psalm. However, when one looks atthe Hebrew word translated "LORD," it becomes apparent that either thefirst "LORD" is not the Father or else the Father is "Jehovah." Eitherway McConkie is wrong. The Psalm reads:  "The LORD [Jehovah] said unto my Lord [Adon], Sit thou at my right  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. (Ps. 110:1)        The first "LORD" in this verse is "Jehovah" who Mormonism saysis Christ, not the Father. The second "Lord" is the Hebrew word "Adon"(singular for "Adonai," meaning master or lord). If the first "LORD" isthe Father and the second "Lord" is the Son, then the Father is"Jehovah" and the Son is "Adon." However, if the Father is not "Jehovah"as McConkie claimed, then the first "LORD" is "Jehovah" the Son, butwho, then, is "Adon?" Obviously the Father is "Jehovah" in this Psalm,and His Son is "Adon."        Another example involves Isa. 42:6 about which McConkie statedthe following:  "I the Lord have called thee in righteousness," _Isaiah quoted the  Father as saying of Christ_, "and will hold thine hand, and will keep  thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the  Gentiles." (Isa. 42:6.) (Promised Messiah, p. 81) (emphasis added)        McConkie said the Father was speaking of Christ in this passagewhich reads:  "I the LORD [Jehovah] have called thee in righteousness, and will hold  thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the  people, for a light of the Gentiles. (Isa. 42:6)        According to McConkie, "I the LORD" refers to the Father, and"thine" and "thee" refer to Christ. However, the "LORD" who is speakingis "Jehovah" which means either McConkie was wrong about who is speakingor else the Father is "Jehovah."        Another example involves Ps. 22:7-8. Of these verses McConkiestated:  "The same Psalm says: "All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they  shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord  that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in  him." (Ps. 22:7-8.) _The fulfillment, as Jesus hung on the cross_, is  found in these words: "The chief priests mocking him, with the scribes  and elders, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be  the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will  believe him. He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will  have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. The thieves also, which  were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth." (Matt.  27:41-44.) (Promised Messiah, pp. 530-531) (emphasis added)        Ps. 22:7-8 reads as follows:  "All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they  shake the head, saying, He trusted on the LORD [Jehovah] that he would  deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.        McConkie said these verses had their fulfillment "as Jesus hungon the cross." That means the person who was scorned in these verses wasChrist. Who, then, was the "LORD" in whom he trusted? It was "Jehovah"the Father.        Another example involves Ps. 31:13 and Ps. 41:9. Regarding them,McConkie stated the following:  "With reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our  Lord's arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was: "They took counsel  together against me, they devised to take away my life." (Ps. 31:13.)  As to the role of Judas in those conspiracies, the Psalmist says:  "Mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me." (Ps. 41:9.) (Promised  Messiah, p. 532)        Apostle McConkie said these Psalms refer to Christ's "arrest andjudicial trials." We shall first consider Ps. 31 and then Ps. 41. WhileMcConkie only quoted verse 13 of Ps. 31, verse 14 will also be includedto give a complete understanding of the matter.  "For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while  they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my  life. But I trusted in thee, O LORD [Jehovah]: I said, Thou art my God  [Elohim]. (Ps. 31:13-14)        McConkie said verse 13 referred to Jesus Christ. Verse 14 goeson to tell that He (Christ) trusted in the "LORD" who is called His"God" or "Elohim." Mormonism teaches that the God above Jesus is"Elohim" the Father. Verse 14, however, reveals that the "Elohim" of theman Jesus is "Jehovah" the Father.        In Ps. 41, McConkie only quoted one verse; however, two verseswill be considered in this examination.  "Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.  But thou, O LORD [Jehovah], be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that  I may requite them. (Ps. 41:9-10)        McConkie stated above that verse 9 referred to Judas' role inChrist's death. Since it was Judas who was the "familiar friend" who"lifted up his heel," the pronouns "mine," "I," "my," and "me" in verse9 must refer to Christ. Notice that at the beginning of verse 10 thereis a change of pronoun to "thou," which refers to the "LORD" (Jehovah).Then the pronouns "me" and "I" which refer to Christ are used again.That means Christ was speaking to "Jehovah" the Father in these verses.        Another example involves McConkie's following remark about Ps.        110:4.  "One of the great Messianic prophecies, spoken by the mouth of David,  says: "The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for  ever after the order of Melchizedek." (Ps. 110:4.) (Promised Messiah,  p. 450)        McConkie admitted this is a Messianic prophecy involving Christ.The question is, What in this verse refers to Christ?  "The LORD [Jehovah] hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest  for ever after the order of Melchizedek. (Ps. 110:4)        Does the "LORD," which is "Jehovah," refer to Christ? IfMcConkie is right and Jesus is "Jehovah," but the Father is not, thenthe "LORD" would have to refer to Christ. But who, then, is the oneaddressed as the "priest forever after the order of Melchizedek?" TheBible reveals that the one referred to is Jesus Christ (Heb. 5:8-10;6:20; 7); therefore, the "LORD" (Jehovah) in Ps. 110:4 is the Father.        Another example involves Isa. 53:4-12. Of these verses McConkiestated:  "Of the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah, Isaiah said...     The _Lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all....     It pleased the _Lord_ to bruise him... (Promised Messiah, p. 234)     (emphasis added)        McConkie rightly said these verses refer to "the atoningsacrifice of the future Messiah." However, what he failed to mention isthat they also prove that the Father is "Jehovah." Verse 6 reads: "Allwe like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way;and the LORD [Jehovah] hath laid on him [Christ] the iniquity of usall," and verse 10 reads: "Yet it pleased the LORD [Jehovah] to bruisehim [Christ]..."        Obviously the "LORD" who laid on Christ "the iniquity of us all"and who bruised Him is God the Father who is called "Jehovah" in theseverses.        Remember, McConkie stated that "some sectarians even believethat Jehovah is the Supreme Deity," and that Christ "came intomortality" as His "Only Begotten" Son. He called this concept"misinformation" that is "untrue." To prove that it is McConkie who ismisinformed and believing untruth, two Scriptural references (2 Sam.7:14; Ps. 2:7) will be examined. McConkie stated the following regardingthese Scriptures:  "In the midst of a passage that is clearly Messianic, the Lord says of  the Seed of David: "I will be his father, and he shall be my son." (2  Sam. 7:14.) In the second Psalm, the whole of which is also clearly  Messianic, occurs this statement: "Thou art my Son; this day have I  begotten thee." (Ps. 2:7.) Paul quotes both of these statements in  Hebrews 1:5 and says they are prophecies that Christ would come as the  Son of God. (Promised Messiah, p. 143)        McConkie cited Heb. 1:5 to show that 2 Sam. 7:14 and Ps. 2:7refer to Christ who "would come as the Son of God." Since McConkie firstreferenced 2 Sam. 7:14, this examination will, too. However, along withverse 14, verses 11-13 will also be included.  "And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people  Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the  LORD [Jehovah] telleth thee that he will make thee an house.  And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers,  I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy  bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.  He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of  his kingdom for ever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son. (2  Sam. 7:11-14)        These verses teach that the "LORD" (Jehovah) would have a Son,the Messiah.        In the second example McConkie cited Ps. 2:7. This examinationwill include verse 8. Notice that it is the "LORD" (Jehovah) who says,"Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee."  "I will declare the decree: the LORD [Jehovah] hath said unto me, Thou  art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.  Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance,  and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.        McConkie said these verses of Scripture are "clearly Messianic,"and he acknowledged they teach that "Christ would come as the Son ofGod." What he is not willing to acknowledge, however, is that theseScriptures also teach that the Father is "Jehovah" and that the"sectarians" who believe "Jehovah is the Supreme Deity whose Son" isJesus Christ, "the Only Begotten," are right in their belief.        Another example involves Mic. 5:4. Of this verse McConkie statedthe following:  "And so, truly, did our Lord act _during his mortal ministry! Truly,  this is he of whom it is written_: "He shall stand and feed in the  strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his  God... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth." (Mic.  5:4.) (Promised Messiah, p. 182) (emphasis added)        According to McConkie, the pronoun "He" at the beginning of Mic.5:4 refers to Christ "during his mortal ministry." Who, then, is the"LORD his God?" Mic. 5:4 reads:  "And he [Christ] shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD  [Jehovah], in the majesty of the name of the LORD [Jehovah] his God  [Elohim]... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.        Obviously the "LORD" of Jesus Christ is "Jehovah" the Father whois referred to as "Jehovah his Elohim."        Another example involves Ps. 2:2 and Isa. 61:1. Of these versesMcConkie stated the following:  "A number of Messianic passages speak of "the Lord, and...his  anointed" (Ps. 2:2), signifying that the Chosen One was consecrated  and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his. _Jesus  applied these passages to himself_ by quoting Isaiah's prophecy. "The  Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek" (Isa.  61:1), and then saying: "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your  ears" (Luke 4:21). (Promised Messiah, pp. 182-183) (emphasis added)        The first source McConkie quoted -- Ps. 2:2 -- reads as follows:  "The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel  together, against the LORD [Jehovah], and against his anointed.        McConkie said the "anointed" one was Christ. If that is true,who was "Jehovah?" If "Jehovah" is always Christ, who was the "anointed"one? Obviously "Jehovah" is referring to God the Father and the"anointed" is indeed referring to Christ. The second source McConkiecited is Isa. 61:1 which states:  "The Spirit of the Lord [Adonai] GOD [Jehovah] is upon me; because the  LORD [Jehovah] hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek;  he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to  the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;        The one who was anointed to preach, bind up, proclaim, and openwas Jesus Christ. Who, then, was the one who anointed Him? This versesays the "LORD" (Jehovah) did the anointing. Again, we face the sameproblem. If "Jehovah" does not refer to the Father, but only to Christ,then Jesus anointed someone, but who? As McConkie pointed out, "Jesusapplied these passages to himself." Therefore, the "Jehovah" whoanointed Christ is God the Father.        Other examples could be cited to show that McConkie and otherMormon leaders are wrong when they say God the Father is not "Jehovah."However, these should be enough to expose their error.        Now, what about Mormonism's claim that Jesus is "Jehovah," butHe is not "Elohim?" It is true that Jesus is "Jehovah." The followingScriptures prove this fact:  "Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] the King of Israel, and his redeemer  the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and  beside me there is no God. (Isa. 44:6)  [Jesus said] ...I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and  was dead... (Rev. 1:17-18)  "...saith the LORD [Jehovah]...they shall look upon me whom they have  pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only  son... (Zech. 12:1,10)  Behold, he [Christ] cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him,  and they also which pierced him... (Rev. 1:7)  "...I am the LORD [Jehovah] thy God, the Holy One of Israel... (Isa.  43:3)  ...Ye denied the Holy One [Christ] and the Just... (Acts 3:14)  "And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of  the LORD [Jehovah] shall be delivered... (Joel 2:32)  "...the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth...there is none other name  under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. (Acts 4:10,12)  "Behold, the Lord GOD [Jehovah] will come with strong hand...his  reward is with him... (Isa. 40:10)  ...Behold, I [Christ] come quickly; and my reward is with me... (Rev.  22:12)  "...the LORD [Jehovah] my God shall come, and all the saints with  thee. (Zech. 14:5)  "...at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints. (1  Thess. 3:13)  "The LORD [Jehovah] is my shepherd... (Ps. 23:1)  [Jesus said] I am the good shepherd... (John 10:14)  "...saith the Lord GOD [Jehovah]. I will seek that which was lost...  (Ezek. 34:15-16)  ...the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.  (Luke 19:10)  "For I am the LORD [Jehovah] thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy  Saviour... (Isa. 43:3)  Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great  God and our Saviour Jesus Christ. (Tit. 2:13. See also Jer. 42:5 and  Rev. 1:5; Mal. 3:6 and Heb. 13:8; 1 Kin. 8:28,39 and John 2:24-25;  Isa. 25:8 and 2 Tim. 1:10; Ps. 107:24,29 and Matt. 8:26; Prov.3:12 and  Rev. 3:19)        While Mormons are right when they say Jesus is "Jehovah," theyare wrong when they say He is not "Elohim." The Bible reveals that"Jehovah" is the only true "Elohim" there is; all others are false.Remember, "Jehovah" is the personal name of the triune God who hasrevealed Himself in the Bible.        Before we consider Biblical quotes which show that "Jehovah" and"Elohim" are not two separate gods as Mormons claims let us first notethat not only are both God the Father and Christ addressed as "Jehovah"and "Elohim" but so is the Holy Spirit.  "Whereof the _Holy Ghost_..._said_...This _is_ the covenant that I  will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my  laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; And  their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. (Heb. 10:15-17)  (emphasis on "Holy Ghost" and "said" added)  Behold, the days come, _saith the LORD_ [Jehovah], that I will make a  new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah...  I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;  and will be their God [Elohim], and they shall be my people.... I will  forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more. (Jer.  31:31,33-34) (emphasis added)  "For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy  men of God spake as they were moved by the _Holy Ghost_. (2 Pet. 1:21)  (emphasis on "Holy Ghost" added)  "The Spirit of the LORD [Jehovah] spake by me, and his word was in  my tongue. (2 Sam. 23:2. See also Heb. 3:7-11 with Ps. 95:6-11)        Let us now continue with the Biblical quotes which show that"Jehovah" and "Elohim" are not two separate gods as Mormons claim.  "And when the LORD [Jehovah] saw that he [Moses] turned aside to see,  God [Elohim] called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said,  Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.... [Bruce R. McConkie  acknowledged that "it was" Christ's "voice that spoke to Moses in the  burning bush..." Promised Messiah, p. 394]  And the LORD [Jehovah] said...  And Moses said unto God [Elohim], Behold, when I come unto the  children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God [Elohim] of your  fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his  name? what shall I say unto them?  And God [Elohim] said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus  shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto  you.  And God [Elohim] said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto  the children of Israel, the LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim] of your  fathers, the God [Elohim] of Abraham, the God [Elohim] of Isaac, and  the God [Elohim] of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for  ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations. (Exod.  3:4,7,13-15)  "And God [Elohim] spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD  [Jehovah]. (Exod. 6:2)  "I am the LORD [Jehovah], and there is none else, there is no God  [Elohim] beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:  (Isa. 45:5)  "But the LORD [Jehovah] is the true God [Elohim], he is the living God  [Elohim], and an everlasting king... (Jer. 10:10)  "Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] the King of Israel, and his redeemer  the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and  beside me there is no God [Elohim]. (Isa. 44:6)  "Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus,  saith the LORD [Jehovah], whose name is The God [Elohim] of hosts.  (Amos 5:27)  "Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's  [Jehovah's] thy God [Elohim], the earth also, with all that therein  is. (Deut. 10:14)  "Wherefore thou art great, O LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim]: for there is  none like thee, neither is there any God [Elohim] beside thee,  according to all that we have heard with our ears. (2 Sam. 7:22)  "And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD [Jehovah],  the God [Elohim] of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land.  (Jon. 1:9)  "For who is God [Elohim] save the LORD [Jehovah]? or who is a rock  save our God [Elohim]? (Ps. 18:31)  "Blessed is the nation whose God [Elohim] is the LORD [Jehovah]...  (Ps. 33:12. See also Ps. 144:15)  "Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God  [Elohim], the LORD [Jehovah], the Creator of the ends of the earth,  fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his  understanding. (Isa. 40:28)  "The mighty God [Elohim], even the LORD [Jehovah], hath spoken, and  called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down  thereof. (Ps. 50:1)  "Sing unto God [Elohim], sing praises to his name: estol him that  rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him. (Ps.  68:4) [Regarding the word "Jah," Bruce R. McConkie stated: "Jah  (Hebrew Yah) is a contracted form of Jehovah, Jahveh, or Yahweh -- all  of which names have reference to Christ, the God of Israel." Mormon  Doctrine, p. 391]  "And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from  Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God [Elohim], whose  name is called by the name of the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts that  dwelleth between the cherubims. (2 Sam. 6:2)  "...the Great the Mighty God [Elohim], the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts, is  his name. (Jer. 32:18)  "O my God [Elohim], make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the  wind....  Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD  [Jehovah]....  That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most  high over all the earth. (Ps. 83:13,16,18)        The Bible clearly teaches that "Jehovah" is "Elohim." In fact,He is the only "Elohim" there is. He is the "true," the "living," the"mighty," the "great," and the "everlasting Elohim." He is the "Elohim"of Israel, of all the kingdoms of the earth, and of the heavens. He isthe Creator who made the heavens and all their host and the earth andall that dwell thereon. "Jehovah's" name is "Elohim of hosts." (Amos5:27)        Not only is "Jehovah," "Elohim," but "Elohim" is "Jehovah." TheBible reveals that "Elohim's" name is "Jah" (Ps. 68:4), "Jehovah" (Ps.83:18), and "Jehovah of hosts." (2 Sam. 6:2; Jer. 32:18)   The nationwhose "Elohim" is "Jehovah" is blessed. (Ps. 33:12) Clearly, this is notthe "Jehovah" and "Elohim" of the Mormons.        Another Mormon error regarding "Elohim" and "Jehovah" is thebelief that "Elohim," not "Jehovah," is the Father of all the spirits,including Jesus. In the Articles of Faith by Apostle James E. Talmage,"A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and The Twelve" apostlesstates that "God the Eternal Father...'Elohim,' is the literal Parentof...the spirits of the human race." (p. 466) This "DoctrinalExposition" also states explicitly that "Jesus Christ is not the Fatherof the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth,for He is one of them. He is The Son, as they are sons and daughters ofElohim." (p. 473)        The Apostle Talmage stated that "_Elohim_...is the name-title ofGod the Eternal Father, whose firstborn Son in the spirit is_Jehovah_--" (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)        The Apostle Bruce R. McConkie stated the following about thismatter: "...Jehovah-Christ...did in fact create the earth and all formsof plant and animal life on the face thereof. _But when it came toplacing man on earth, there was a change in Creators_. That is, theFather himself became personally involved. All things were created bythe Son, using the power delegated by the Father, except man. _In thespirit and again in the flesh, man was created by the Father_. There wasno delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation wasconcerned." (Promised Messiah, p. 62) (emphasis added)        Mormon leaders claim that "Jehovah-Christ" did not create eitherman's spirit or his body. They maintain that the Mormon "Elohim," who isthe father, created man both in spirit and body. The Bible reveals thetruth about who created man.  "And Moses spake unto the LORD [Jehovah], saying,  Let the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] of the _spirits of all  flesh_, set a man over the congregation. (Num. 27:15-16. See also  16:20-23) (emphasis added)  "...the LORD [Jehovah], which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth  the foundation of the earth, and _formeth the spirit of man within  him_. (Zech. 12:1) (emphasis added)  "...the LORD [Jehovah]...made us this soul... (Jer. 38:16)  "For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for  the spirit should fail before me, and the _souls which I have  made_....  ...saith the LORD [Jehovah]... (Isa. 57:16,19) (emphasis on "souls...I  have made" added)  "Behold, I am the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] _of all flesh_...  (Jer. 32:27) (emphasis added)  "Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that _formed thee  from the womb_.  I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things... (Isa. 44:24)  (emphasis added)  "Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah]...  I have made the earth, and _created man_ upon it... (Isa. 45:11-12)  (emphasis added)  "...God [Elohim] created man upon the earth...  Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD  [Jehovah] he is God [Elohim]; there is none else beside him. (Deut.  4:32,35)  "Thus saith God [El] the LORD [Jehovah]...he that spread forth the  earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the  people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein. (Isa. 42:5)  "...Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts, the God [Elohim] of  Israel... I have made the earth, _the man_ and the beast that are upon  the ground... (Jer. 27:4-5) (most emphasis added)        The Bible reveals that it is "Jehovah" who is the "Elohim of thespirits of all flesh" and "of all flesh" itself, that it was He who"formed the spirit of man within him," that He "made us this soul" and"formed us from the womb." He did indeed "create man."        If Mormon leaders are right when they say Jesus is "Jehovah,"then they are wrong when they say he did not create man. If they areright when they say the father is the one who created man, then they arewrong when they say he is not "Jehovah."        Although Mormon leaders teach that Jesus did not create man,Mormon scriptures teach that he did. The BoM states the following:  "Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son....  And never have I showed myself unto _man whom I have created_, for  never has man believed in me as thou hast....  Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and  _man have I created_ after the body of my spirit... (Eth. 3:14-16)  (emphasis added)  "For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world; for it is _I  that hath created them_... (Mos. 26:23) (emphasis added)  "...the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of  Jacob...is that same God who created the heavens and the earth, and  all things that in them are.  Behold _he created Adam_... (Mor. 9:11-12) (emphasis added)        D&C, 93:10 states that "the worlds were made by him [Christ];_men were made by him_; all things were made by him, and through him,and of him." (emphasis added)        Another error by Bruce R. McConkie involving "Jehovah" and hiscreation is the belief that "Jehovah" had "many" pre-mortal spiritshelping him create. Included in this alleged group was Joseph Smith, Jr.  "That he [Christ] was aided in the creation of this earth by "many of  the noble and great" spirit children of the Father is evident from  Abraham's writings. Unto those superior spirits Christ said: "We will  go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these  materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell." (Abra.  3:22-24.) Michael or Adam was one of these. Enoch, Noah, Abraham,  Moses, Peter, James, and John, Joseph Smith, and many other "noble and  great" ones played a part in the great creative enterprise. (Doctrines  of Salvation, vol. 1, pp. 74-75.) (Mormon Doctrine, p. 169)        The Bible reveals the truth about this matter:  "Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that formed thee  from the womb, I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things; that  stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by  myself. (Isa. 44:24)  "Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of  the sea. (Job 9:8)        "Jehovah," by Himself, created all things. He had no allegedpreexistent spirit helpers assisting Him.        Regarding the Mormon 'Elohim," the Apostle McConkie stated:"Elohim. plural word though it is, is also used as the exaltedname-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes hissupremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods." (MormonDoctrine, p. 224) He also stated that "Jesus...is above all save theFather only." (Promised Messiah, p. 363)        The Bible states that the One who is God above all so-calledgods is the triune God "Jehovah."  "For the LORD [Jehovah] is a great God [El], and a great King above  all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 95:3)  "For thou, LORD [Jehovah], art high above all the earth: thou art  exalted far above all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 97:9)  "Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods  [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11. See also Ps. 135:5; Deut. 10:17)        If Mormon leaders are right when they say "Jehovah" is god theson and "Elohim" is god the father, these verses from the Bible would beteaching that the Mormon son is above his father. However, as McConkieclearly stated, Mormons believe "Elohim" the father, not "Jehovah" theson, is the "God above all Gods" -- that Jesus is above all except thefather; yet the Bible teaches that "Jehovah" is above all "Elohim."        At a BYU Dev. on March 2, 1982, Bruce R. McConkie made thefollowing remark about praying to Jesus:  "Another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly  to Christ because of some special friendship they feel has been  developed....  This is plain sectarian nonsense. Our prayers are addressed to the  Father, and to him only....  ...Perfect prayer is addressed to the Father, in the name of the Son;  it is uttered by the power of the Holy Ghost... (Our Relationship With  the Lord, pp. 19-20)        McConkie states on p. 335 of his book Promised Messiah that theMormons "pray to the Father, not the Son..." On p. 306 of the same bookMcConkie states that "Christ [the Son] is Jehovah." This is important toremember, because although McConkie said prayer is not to be offered tothe Mormon Christ who is "Jehovah," the Bible states repeatedly in theOT that people prayed to "Jehovah," and He not only heard those prayers,but He accepted them as valid requests. The following is but a smallsample of the vast number of times people prayed to "Jehovah."  "In my distress I called upon the LORD [Jehovah], and cried unto my  God [Elohim]: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came  before him, even into his ears. (Ps. 18:6)  "And the LORD [Jehovah] said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy  supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this  house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine  eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. (1 Kin. 9:3)  "And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our  supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD  [Jehovah] thy God [Elohim], even for all this remnant... (Jer. 42:2)  "O LORD [Jehovah], I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to  the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who  desire to fear thy name... (Neh. 1:11)  "And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this  prayer and supplication unto the LORD [Jehovah], he arose from before  the altar of the LORD [Jehovah], from kneeling on his knees with his  hands spread up to heaven. (1 Kin. 8:54)  "He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed  unto the LORD [Jehovah]. (2 Kin. 4:33)  "Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], the God  [Elohim] of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy  tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years. (Isa. 38:5)  "I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I  said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD [Jehovah]; and  thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.  For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when  thou mayest be found... (Ps. 32:5-6)        Notice above in Ps. 32:6 that the "godly" pray to "Jehovah."According to McConkie and other Mormon leaders, that is Christ the veryone to whom McConkie said people should not pray.        The Bible reveals there is only one true "Elohim," and His nameis "Jehovah." All other "Elohim" are false. They are idols that causetheir followers to commit adultery against the true "Elohim" andidolatry.  "For the LORD [Jehovah] is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to  be feared above all gods [Elohim].  For all the gods [Elohim] of the nations are idols: but the LORD  [Jehovah] made the heavens. (Ps. 96:4-5)  "Thou shalt have no other gods [Elohim] before me. (Exod. 20:3)  "Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods  [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11)  "And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God  [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and  worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely  perish. (Deut. 8:19)  "Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods [Elohim].  They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me:  for if thou serve their gods [Elohim], it will surely be a snare unto  thee. (Exod. 23:32- 33)  "Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn  aside, and serve other gods [Elohim], and worship them. (Deut. 11:16)  "That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you;  neither make mention of the name of their gods [Elohim], nor cause to  swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them.  (Josh. 23:7)  "...neither walk after other gods [Elohim] to your hurt. (Jer. 7:6)  "But the LORD [Jehovah] is the true God [Elohim], he is the living God  [Elohim]... (Jer. 10:10)  "And they forsook the LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim] of their fathers,  which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods  [Elohim], of the gods [Elohim] of the people that were round about  them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD [Jehovah]  to anger. (Jud. 2:12)  "Shall a man make gods [Elohim] unto himself, and they are no gods  [Elohim]? Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I  will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know  that my name is the LORD [Jehovah]. ( Jer. 16:20-21)  "And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD [Jehovah], choose you  this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods [Elohim] which your  fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods  [Elohim] of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my  house, we will serve the LORD [Jehovah].  And the people answered and said, God [Elohim] forbid that we should  forsake the LORD [Jehovah], to serve other gods [Elohim]. (Josh.  24:15-16)        These verses teach that the only true, living "Elohim" in heavenand on earth is "Jehovah" -- the triune God who made heaven and earthand all therein.        "Jehovah" is greater than any "Elohim," because all other"Elohim" are idols. The reality behind them is demonic. (Deut. 32:17)"Jehovah Elohim" has given explicit warnings and guidelines regardingthese false "Elohim." He told His people not to have any "Elohim" butHim. He told the people that if they left Him for the false "Elohim,"those "Elohim" would be a snare to them, and they would be hurt andwould perish. He warned the people to "take heed" that their "heart benot deceived" into worshiping, serving, swearing by, and makingcovenants with false "Elohim." "Jehovah Elohim" told His people He wouldeventually judge all false "Elohim" and their followers.        Despite these warnings and guidelines, "Elohim's" covenantpeople forsook Him and believed in and worshiped the false "Elohim's" ofthe people they came in contact with. Ju. 10:6 states that "the childrenof Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah] and servedBaalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods [Elohim] of Syria, and the gods[Elohim] of Zidon, and the gods [Elohim] of Moab, and the gods [Elohim]of the children of Ammon, and the gods [Elohim] of the Philistines, andforsook the LORD [Jehovah], and served not him."        This examination has shown that the "Elohim" of Mormonism, likethe "Elohim" in Ju. 10:6 is not the true "Jehovah Elohim." Therefore,the people who leave the true "Elohim" for the Mormon "Elohim" will do"evil...in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah]."        Although McConkie attacked Christians for their belief in atriune God who is Spirit and for their belief that God the Father[Jehovah] sent His Son into the world, these beliefs are true. God istriune; He is Spirit; He is "Jehovah;" and He did send His Son into theworld to redeem mankind.        It is obvious from this examination that it is not theChristians who "thrash around in...darkness" about who "Elohim" and"Jehovah" are. One wonders what "Holy Writ" McConkie had in mind when hestated that it attests to the fact that "Elohim is the Father, and thatJehovah is the Son." He certainly did not mean the Bible which teachesthat the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all the one "Jehovah Elohim."He apparently did not mean the D&C either, because chapter 109, verses1,4,9-10, 14,19,22,24,29,34,42,47,56,68,77 refer to the Father as"Jehovah."Summary        Obviously Joseph Fielding Smith's statement that the Mormons"have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of God" (Doctrinesof Salvation, 1:279) is not accurate. The Mormon gods are not the trueGod as Mormonism claims, but are idols which cause their followers tocommit adultery against God and idolatry.        In answer to Jesus' question, "But whom say ye that I am,"Mormons say Jesus is someone different from the Jesus who is revealed inthe Bible and whom the apostles preached. Therefore, anyone trusting inthe Mormon Jesus is believing in "another Jesus" whom Paul warned about.        Bernard P. Brockbank, of the First Quorum of the Seventy,admitted in the May 1977 issue of The Ensign, a Mormon publication, thatthe Mormon Jesus is different from the Christian Jesus. He stated that"it is true that many of the Christian churches worship a differentJesus Christ than is worshipped by the Mormons or The Church of JesusChrist of Latter-day Saints." (p. 26)        The people who believe in the Mormon Jesus are committingadultery against God and idolatry. They do not have the Son; therefore,they do not have the Father, and they do not have eternal life. As theApostle Bruce R. McConkie rightly stated: "Salvation comes only byworshiping the true God." (Promised Messiah, p. 163) McConkie alsorightly stated that "the mere worship of a god who has the properscriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true andliving God," because the "true names of Deity" can be applied to "falseconcepts of God." (Mormon Doctrine, p. 270) Remember that the ApostleStephen L. Richards admitted that Joseph Smith, Jr., gave "a newconception of God and the Godhead." (Contributions of Joseph Smith, p.1)        It is important for the people who have left the true triune Godrevealed in the Bible to repent and return to Him. They must forsake thesins of idolatry and adultery which they are committing in Mormonism.The Bible says:  "...all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from  me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD  [Jehovah], the fountain of living waters. (Jer. 17:13)  "And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God  [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and  worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely  perish. (Deut. 8:19)  "Thou shalt make no covenant with...their gods [Elohim]. (Exod. 23:32)  "...Put away the strange gods [Elohim] that are among you, and be  clean, and change your garments. (Gen. 35:2)  "...flee from idolatry. (1 Cor. 10:14)        It is necessary that Christians heed the warnings of the Bible.If they do, they will not fall into the sins of adultery against God andidolatry. Remember, to know the "only true God" is eternal life. (John17:3)  "...their gods [Elohim] shall be a snare unto you." (Ju. 2:3. See also  Exod. 23:32-33)

And let's not   forget how it saves future job-seekers and college-admission-seekers   from having to compete with all those kids in the compound who won't  be growing up to work or go to school.   <sarcasm mode off>  But it doesn't save you guys on the net from having to hear me say,  "I told you so!"    Whether Koresh started the fire or the feds did  the bottom line is the same:  there's a whole lot of dead children   who would be alive today if they had been released back when we were  debating this a few weeks ago.---peter

Have an open mind.  And so end the mockery.  Gain knowledge of the real God.  Put your presumptions aside.  Read theBible and know that there is, truly is, a reason for everything andthere exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyondour shallow worldly experience.  A person who commits himself  to seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But aperson who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find something to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing onewill gain with that attitude is folly.Be careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passagesin the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that eventhough they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not.Be assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies suchdeep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied. I will personally guarantee that one.  As Jesus put it, "You will neverbe thirsty again.  Your cup will even flow over."From King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):    "It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;     to search out a matter is the glory of kings."Jesus says in John 6:44 & 55:   "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him."And in John 3:16:   "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,   that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal   life."You are included in "whosoever".  And I also pray that the Father isdrawing you, which it seems He is doing else you wouldn't be postingto talk.religion.misc.  Remember Brian, you could be a St. Paul in themaking.  Paul not only mocked Christians as you do, but also had pleasurestoning them.  Yet God showed him mercy, saved him, and Paul becameon of the most celebrated men in the history of God's church.You see Brian, I myself better be careful and not judge you, becauseyou could indeed be the next Paul.  For with the fervor that you attackChristians,  one day you might find yourself one, and like Paul,proclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more.Or you could be the next Peter.  What Jesus said to Peter, Jesus would probably say to you: "Satan would surely like to have you."  Why so?Because Peter was hard-headed, cynical and demonstrated greatmoments of stupidity, but once Peter committed himself to a taskhe did with full heart.  Peter was the only apostle to have thefaith to walk on water as Jesus did.You asked "Why not believe in Zeus?"  Zeus didn't offer eternal life.You got nothing to gain by believing in Zeus.-------------------------------Brian Ceccarellibrian@gamma1.lpl.arizona.edu

I have been following this businesssince it started 52 days ago.  The Branch Davidians have occupied the Mt.Carmel location for some years, and their neighbors (you know, the peoplenext door) have said to a man, that the BD folks were quiet and neverbothered anybody.There were some defector from the BD who alleged child abuse within themovement, but how does this bring in the Feds? In particular what interestwould ATF have in child abuse. O.K. It was the allegation of possesingillegal automatic weapons.  A search warrant could have been obtained(properly) only on probable cause. This means that some evidence that anillegal auto weapon was shipped in, or an illegal kit for convertingsemi-auto weapons to full automatic was purchased or shipped.In either case, how does this require an NO-KNOCK warrent, with a bunch ofmacho hot dog assholes busting into the place *without* identifyingthemselves. Milleniests tend to be a bit paranoid anyway. It is nosurprise they shot when invaded. Hell I am not a religious extremist and Imight have done the same myself. If the DEA busted into my house bymistake without identifying themselve and I had a gun in my hand, I wouldshoot first and wonder later.So if it was illegal guns, the ATF should have gotten a normal warrant(how can you flush a 50 calibre machine gun down the toilet?) andpresented it in a peaceful normal way. David Koresh has had brushes withthe law, even standing trial for attempted murder in which he wasacquitted. In every prior brush with the law, Koresh and his people actedpeacibly. There was no prior action on the part of the BD folks toindicate that they were any danger to society.NOTE: The question of whether the BD people were religious extremists orslight daft is totally irrelevant. It is *not* against the law to belooney or zany.Look and learn folks. And be VERY afraid.Conan the Libertarian-- "If you can't love the Constitution, then at least hate the Government"

And so religion is kind of a nice fantasy.Religion _can_ be a crutch. Before going much further on that thread,I would suggest that you take a closer look at the veriety of worldreligions out there, though. There are athiestic religions as well astheistic religions. There are religions that claim knowledge aboutsuch things as an afterlife, and there are religions that make no suchclaims. My perspective is that lots of people talk, but all that means is thattalk is cheap. When someone gives me substantial evidence about anafterlife, then I'll start believing in one. In the mean while, myreligion deals with what we know exists, that is life here and now.>Religion also describes things we don't know about the universe (things>science has not yet described) and it also gives people a feeling of>security... that if they just do this one thing and everything will be ok.Again, some religions do, and others do not.

They are happy with>their fantasy and they feel that other people will be happy with it too>(they can't accept the fact that there are people who would rather accept>the harsh reality that they are running from).I'll tell you that I moved from an athiestic perspective to a theisticone because I believe that I observed phenomenon that was better explained from the theistic perspective, while the athiestic perspectivecould not explain it. However that does not mean that I'm willing toaccept a lot of fourth hand gobbly-gook that contridicts modern sciencealong with my theistic perspective.>> >>     _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/       _/    * Atheist>>    _/        _/    _/   _/ _/ _/ _/     * Libertarian>>   _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/   _/  _/      * Pro-individuality>>        _/  _/     _/  _/       _/       * Pro-responsibility>> _/_/_/_/  _/      _/ _/       _/ Jr.    * and all that jazz...>Nancieric

Unfortunately, I have no confidence thatsuch a situation will ever arise. Some of us think there's a big God in the sky, some don't.  Some thinkthey've been chosen by God, others disagree.

The fact is, there are *two* references toJesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_, one of which has unquestionably at leastbeen altered by Christians.  Origen wrote, in the third century, thatJosephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, while the long passagesays the opposite.  There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of theJews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-hofor Jesus and may be authentic.   There is no question that Origen, in the third century, saw a referenceto Jesus in Josephus.  There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ whichlack the references.It is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted, butI don't think it's very likely--nor do I think there is a consensus inthe scholarly community that this is the case. (I know G.A. Wells takesthis position, but that's because he takes the very small minority viewthat Jesus never existed.  And he is a professor of German, not ofbiblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant tothe historicity of Jesus.)Jim Lippard              Lippard@CCIT.ARIZONA.EDUDept. of Philosophy      Lippard@ARIZVMS.BITNETUniversity of ArizonaTucson, AZ 85721

Maybe it was thegovernment; maybe it was Koresh.  I wouldn't immediately rule out thegovernment just because the FBI said that a couple of cult memberstorched Koresh's wood-frame house.  I think that the credibility of theFBI and the cigarette cops is questionable at best; at worst they arebald-faced liers.  I read in a newspaper today that one of the BDs thatsurvived the fire said that one of the tanks that crashed through theirwood-frame house knocked over a lantern which later on caused thecompound to errupt in flames.  Also, I have heard that one of the cultmembers who earlier said that he and another individual started the fireis no longer claiming that he did it.  Moreover, he and possibly theother person may not have even really said that they did it in thefirst place---we only have the FBI's WORD ON THIS.  I'll believe it whenI hear from a cult member's own mouth and not before then.The FBI claims that they saw two cult members starting the fire.  Theyclaimed that the two were clad in black clothing and were wearing gasmasks.  Hmmm...  Sounds like they might have been describing an ATFagent to me.  Weren't the cigarette cops wearing black?  Note:  thisis just speculation on my part.  Still, it is something to think about.Here's something else to ponder upon:  the two agents that were plantedin the compound might have done something to start that fire.  I don'tknow if they did it deliberately or not---if they did at all---but Iwould like to see statements from these two agents on the events thattranspired during that day.  I think that they would be ratherenlightening don't you think?  They were inside the compound so theyought to have a real good idea of what went on in there.  Of course ifthey did help burn down the house then I doubt that they would bevery forthcoming with any information.The FBI also mentioned that fire errupted in multiple locations in thecompound.  They *may* have said this so that people might be morelikely to be convinced that the BDs started the fire.  However,consider that if the FBI did light-up that house would they admit toit?  I think not.  Imagine the public outrage that would ensue ifpeople discovered that the FBI killed 86 people.  Obviously, the FBIwould do its best to suppress the truth and make people think the BDsstarted the fire.  Fire can spread in unusual ways in a wood house---fires burning in more than one location in a house isn't inconsistentwith a house fire.  The tear gas cannisters---which do produce heatdespite what you may have been told by the media---may have contributedto starting the blaze.  Also, it was very windy on the day of thefire.  Flames and burning debri might have floated over to parts ofthe house that weren't already on fire.  Like I said the verdict isn'tin yet.  The FBI may very well be guilty of a holocaust.> -- > John Mechalas                                          "I'm not an actor, but> mechalas@gn.ecn.purdue.edu                                 I play one on TV."> Aero Engineering, Purdue University                     #include disclaimer.hScott Kennedy,  Brewer and PatriotBefore:  "David Koresh is a cheap thug who interprets          the Bible through the barrel of a gun..."  --ATF spokesmanAfter:   "[The ATF] is a cheap thug who interprets          [the Constitution] through the barrel of a gun..."  --Me

My rasberry award goes to Dave Palmerwho makes the following benediction after spewing out the facts,"Score another one for the forces of ignorance and superstition"as if the public deaths of over 80 people were not a clear and definite warning as to what happens to people who follow false prophets.From where I set, looks like Satan has a three-bagger going.In article <1993Apr20.051902.9472@gw.wmich.edu> x86carnell@gw.wmich.edu writes:>In article <C5rLps.Fr5@world.std.com>, jhallen@world.std.com (Joseph H Allen) writes:>> In article <1qvk8sINN9vo@clem.handheld.com> jmd@cube.handheld.com (Jim De Arras) writes:>>>I'm short of patience tonite, but rabid dogs deserve and get better treatment  >>>than the BDs got.>> >> Although I'm an atheist, the events in Waco have really sickened me.

One can argue aboutthe initial raid, but it would be worth mentioning, before the facts getlost, that1. The Branch Davidians were tipped off that the BATF was comingduring the initial raid.2. The Branch Davidians opened fire first.It is also worth noting that the Branch Davidians, according tothe FBI's statements, opened fire immediately when the FBI issued the warningover the phone, and that the vehicle which launched the tear gas grenadesdid so under fire from the compound.>>> >> The killing of the four BATF agents was surey a dispicable act, but that was>> an escalation of the confrontation which the BATF started.  War is bad>>Even this seemingly obvious issue is far from settled.  According to>"Newsweek" (4/5/93), "some federal law-enforcement officials>now believe that at least some ATF agents were brought down by>friendly fire."  The articles goes on to say how "sources" close to the>Justice Department claim that some agents were caught in "heavy crossfire."Clearly, no one in the government wanted a repeat of the initial shootout, That's why they went in with riot control gas. This would have workedwith minimal casualties (The Branch Davidians apparently did not have gasmasks) if Koresh had not had a very different reaction in mind.>>>> precisely because of humanity's tendancy for escalation.

(likely ?).They both indicated that they had no idea that a Masada-like mass suicidecould result from the introduction of non-lethal agents into the compound.Some of these issues are highly technical - the impression I haveis that the "Ranch Apocalypse" represented a Rubrik's cube for thecounterterrorist types. The Branch Davidians were too well armed for for a simple assault (the BATF found this out the hard way). The complexwas probably to big for the kind of "surgical" Delta Force coup de mainthat the Bundesgrenschutz did in the 1970s when one of their airlinerswas highjacked by "Black September". The reason this seige had gone onas long as it had was that the government really didn't have any good options,and to wait it out was the safest and most logical choice.>>Similarly, why the raid yesterday?

Koresh had made some statements building that idea up, and Easter came and went with nothing happening. It may be that the authoritiesfelt emboldened to move for this reason. IT IS just a theory.>>Why yesterday?  Because this was turning into a huge embarassment for>the Clinton administration.I don't believe this is a valid argument.

This matter ties in with the infamous "social scientists are notreally scientists" brouhaha on sci.skeptic. Here is a case where, ifone believes the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI, thepredictions of psychological experts were proven false, not underlaboratory conditions, but in the cauldron of practical application.2. Koresh's actions (or the actions of whoever started the fire - we're not likely to know what went on in there) contrast so violentlywith the example of Christ that I'm sure many Christians find itdifficult to understand why or how this happened. Under such conditions, the search for scapegoats is only too natural a humanreaction, even though that is not a particularly Christian responseeither.3. Koresh's mother apparently had some false hopes that the cult members had sought refuge in a bunker somewhere in the complex. Her grief must be monumental at this time, and the search for a way toescape moral responsibility for her family's destruction is likewisereal. We may not have seen the end to the self depravation.4. The fact, simply stated, is that a good number of innocent childrenand not-so-innocent adults died horribly for no good reason. It isexceptionally hard for us, as human beings, to accept this fact.We can hope for some ultimate salvation, some panacea to make itbetter, but even though hope is a wonderful thing, that doesn'tmake it so. There is no meaning to this thing. It just is.Bill R.--"When up a dangerous faction starts,         "My opinions do not representWith wrath and vengeance in their hearts;     those of my employer orBy solemn League and Cov'nant bound,          any government agency."To ruin, slaughter, and confound;             - Bill Riggs (1993)To turn religion to a fable,And turn the Government to a Babel;Pervert the law, disgrace the gown,Corrupt the senate, rob the crown;To sacrifice old England's glory,And make her infamous in story.When such a tempest shook the land,How could unguarded virtue stand ?"- Jonathan Swift (1732)

This is true inexactly the same sense that as a philosophy Christians' disbelief inZeus is worthless.  Atheists construct their personal philosophiesfrom many different sources, building non-god-based ideas in the sameway as Christians build non-Zeus-based ideas of thunderbolts.Atheists no more *base* their philosophy on atheism than Christiansbase theirs on the nonexistence of Zeus.The "weak atheist" position is logically extremely assailable -- anylogical demonstration of the existence of a god completely destroys itas soon as the demonstration is made in the presence of a given weakatheist.  Atheists in this newsgroup are barraged regularly withattempts to provide such a logical demonstration, and they all failmiserably.  In fact, most of the people around here who claim the"strong (as opposed to mathematical) atheist" position do so on thisbasis: not only do we not believe in a god, but also all the argumentspresented in favor of particular gods have to date proven unsound;therefore, one can say that those gods as argued by those arguments donot exist.  This doesn't apply to such philosophers' gods as aredefined to be logically undemonstrable, but these are not the gods ofpopular religion, and the coherence of such claims is quitequestionable. -- Jim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NCThese are my opinions.

They still arm themselves to "defend the#>faith", and stockpile food as well.  They have been involved in quite a#>lot of illegal activity - including multiple (and often underage) wives#>for the leaders - a practice still in vogue with some splinters of their#>sect.  The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking.#                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^By "they," you mean the leaders of the lds church?  I grant you that whenJoseph Smith was still alive, plenty of "accusations" were filed, most ofwhich had little bearing with reality, as evidenced by various verdicts.I have studied lds history for 15 years now, and I have yet to see provethat the lds leadership was involved, in quote: "illegal activities."Plural marriage, yes, but your charge of "underage" wives sounds like itcould have originated from a tabloid, and discredits the high moralstandards which characterized these leaders and families, unlike, as itappears, those of David Koresh.#        Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyram#were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over#who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like#Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider#Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I'm led to understand.  Make#no mistake, this was no messiah we're talking about in Smith).  TheAnd neither did he claim he was.  As the church reflects the moralaptitude of its leaders (and especially those of Joseph Smith), I havenothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only "crime"was that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  Many have triedto explain the "Smith phenomenon" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5million member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith'stestimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.#thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed#down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only#entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have#been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The#Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn't of much help#here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects.#Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited#for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other#claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)"The rest" were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church,while the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the variousauxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the newprophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures anddoctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST inline to fill the prophet Joseph Smith's vacancy: he was the seniorapostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicatedthat it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.Other rightful "heirs" were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated(Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified,Joseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an emptyland beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This"Rekhabite" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipatedby the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.Granted, a couple of "do-it-yourselfers" stayed behind, unwilling tosacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, butthis also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  Thechurch benefitted from this purification process: they became evenmore unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.#        Both sects practiced the "1-year food stockpile" doctrine,#and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at#least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a#militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than#face large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered a#great deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quite#justified in making military training a good thing.  Remember,#this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people#had nobody to turn to save themselves.##        Just a little context to put this all in perspective.BTW, since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (one ofthe largest denominations in the country) a "sect"???  It didn't "splinter"from any other religion, as did say, the Southern Baptists or Methodists.#>So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J. Edgar Hoover was very#>impressed with the way they kept secrets.  (They're pledged to defend#>secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood.  Many actually#>do - even to the point of suicide.)What a balloney.  Suicide is sinful and against the law of God.  I amnot comfortable with this alleged "cosiness" with Mammon: I assure youthat *many* among us reject this attitude categorically.  Period.  OurONLY true allegiance is to our God and to the leaders which He hasappointed to represent Him.  In any regard, to read this TRASH (aboutsuicide and "atone for sins with blood") is yet another insultingmisrepresentation of what my church believes in and stands for...##        The RLDS, the Reorganized LDS, are friendly rivals of the LDS#and delight in telling stories about them, which generates quick retorts#from the LDS members and everybody has a grand time.  At no time have#I ever even heard this hinted at.

Though J. Edgar is finally gone, the FBI#>personnel (especially the field agents) are still heavily Mormon.#>I have often wondered how this might affect the FBI's treatment#>of religious organizations a Mormon would consider heretical.Preposterous.  Even if this were true (reliable data, please), Iam convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codesof honor and conduct (that's why they were selected for in thefirst place, remember?).  Besides, one of our Articles of FaithSTRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion, and that allpeople are free to worship "*how*, *where*, or *what* they may."#        If it's true, there would be little affect.  LDS and RLDS#philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true#Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his#own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may#as well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  You#can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected#it.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to#Buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they#will not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hoover#liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade#alcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like.#These people are the "salt of the Earth" and as such are more#easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.A good explanation, I can accept that.  You are right that lds peopleare sometimes a little too cosy with Mammon's "orders" (the latepresident Kimball, for example, was an exception with his strongopposition of the selection of the MX "Peace Keeper" missile mazein Utah).#        That's my somewhat educated guess, anyway.  Both sects have#splinter groups that don't mirror the masses, but these are small#and rare, and hardly worth noting their common ancestry.##        None of this has any relevance to guns, though.  When a#man's religion is used to deny him the right of self-protection with#the weapons suitable for the job, he'll find an ally in me.##< Dan Sorenson, DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu >#<  ISU only censors what I read, not what I say.

Having actual existance.3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based onobservable phenomenon.By this definition, science does not have an objective worth, since thephrase "objective worth" is an oxymoron. However you asked something a little differently this time, you asked for an objective basis for anotion. The fact that the use of science as an intellectual tool isresponsible for changes in our world (the changes are material, andthus "objective") would provide an objective _basis_ for an argument.However, the conclusion arrived at from that argument (that science is "good") is subjective.I think that the problem here is one of word usage. Take a little timeand read the definitions of these words: objective, subjective, worth,value, morality, good, evil. I believe that if you think about the meaning of them for a while, you will have to conclude that there is nosuch thing as an objective morality.>Frank O'Dwyer                                  'I'm not hatching That'>odwyer@sse.ie                                  from "Hens",  by Evelyn Conloneric

The original letters he wrote have>>long since decayed into dust.  If he were alive today and I could> > Do you question the existence of Alexander the Great, Tilgrath Pilisar III,> Nero, Caligula, Josephus, Cyrus the Great, Artexerxes?

Somehow I doubt do that yourselfthat.  Thus since I doubt you accept everything written in every historicaldocument, I would ask how you can thereby objectively justify complete faithin the words of the books attributed to Peter. I shall now give an example of a document from antiquity, which I am sure youreject; it dates from the time of Ramses II (This was first presented here byMatthew Wiener).  These inscriptions were carved soon after a battle, and werecarved with the Pharoah's specific approval so we have true originals, ratherthan mere copies.  This account records the the battle of Kadesh (circa 1285BC), which occurred on the river Orontes, (about 100 miles south of Aleppo). The Egyptians won this battle with the Hittites, and Ramses had his victoryinscribed all over the place.  A few of of these inscriptions have survived innear perfect form.  It is a record of how the Pharoah pretty muchsingle-handedly defeated the Hittites, after being separated from his troops. Note that the Egyptian wavers back and forth between first and third person. The following is from Miriam Lichtheim`s _Ancient Egyptian Literature_ volumeII.My majesty caused the forces of the foes from Hitti to fallon their faces, one upon the other, as crocodiles fall, intothe water of the Orontes.  I was after them like a griffin;I attacked all the countries, I alone.  For my infantry andmy chariotry had deserted me; not one of them stood lookingback.  As I live, as Ra loves me, as my father Atum favorsme, everything that my majesty has told I did it in truth,in the presence of my infantry and my chariotry.(Note: This paragraph records not only Ramses "divine word," but also thatthere were thousands of witnesses to the event.  Now from the heart of battle.)Then his majesty drove at a gallop and charged the forcesof the Foe from Hitti, being alone by himself, none otherwith him.  His majesty proceeded to look about him andfound 2500 chariots ringing him on his way out ...No officer was with me, no charioteer,No soldier of the army, no shield-bearer;My infantry, my chariotry yielded before them,Not one of them stood firm to fight with them.His majesty spoke: "What is this, father Amun?Is it right for a father to ignore his son?Are my deeds a matter for you to ignore?Do I not walk and stand at your word?I have not neglected an order you gave.Too great is he, the great lord of Egypt,To allow aliens to step on his path!What are these Asiatics to you, O Amun,The wretches ignorant of god?Have I not made for you many great monuments,...I call to you, my father Amun,I am among a host of strangers;All countries are arrayed against me,I am alone, there's none with me!...The labors of many people are nothing,Amun is more helpful than they;I came here by the command of your mouth,O Amun, I have not transgressed your command!"Now though I prayed in a distant land,My voice resounded in Southern Thebes.I found Amun came when I called to him,He gave me his hand and I rejoiced.He called from behind as if near by:"Forward, I am with you,I your father, my hand is with you,I prevail over a hundred thousand men,I am lord of victory, lover of valor!"I found my heart stout, my breast in joy,All I did succeeded, I was like Mont....I slaughtered among them at my will,Not one looked behind him,Not one turned around,Whoever fell down did not rise....One called out to the other saying:"No man is he who is among us,It is Seth great-of-strength, Baal in person;Not deeds of man are these his doings,They are of one who is unique,Who fights a hundred thousand without soldiers and chariots,Come quick, flee before him,To seek life and breathe air;For he who attempts to get close to him,His hands, all his limbs grow limp.One cannot hold either bow or spears,When one sees him come racing along!"My majesty hunted them like a griffin,I slaughtered among them unceasingly.So you see Brian, we have a few original manuscripts recording the miraculous battle between the Ramses and the Hittites.  Do you reject them as being*completely* true? I suspect you do, and if so, then do you also, in your ownwords:     "question the existence of Alexander the Great, Tilgrath Pilisar III,     Nero, Caligula, Josephus, Cyrus the Great, Artexerxes?"Do you also thereby question all their documents? That`s the problem with your"all or nothing" approach.  Many ancient people used to mix a bit of fancywith their facts.  So for you to say that we must either accept all of Peter(and the rest of the New Testament) or accept no records of antiquity at all,forces you thereby, to accept the verity of documents you probably do not findcompletely credible. As to your other argument that so many people have testified to Jesus, that hemust be true:> Are you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness? > Are you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony from> shepherds to IRS agents to royal officials to kings to computer> programmers, fiction?  With a scoff of your keyboard, with near> complete ignorance of the testimonies, are you going to say that> that is all complete hooey?   Would that not be the most audacious> display of arrogance?  Do you actually think you know better than> King Solomon, King David, or even Abraham Lincoln? I have three points.  First, this is "argumentum ad populum" (ie: appeal to popular opinion); youcannot vote on truth.  For instance, do the millions of Hindu's past andpresent who testify to the reality of Brahma, constitute actual evidence forthe existence of Brahma? How would you answer your own question in regards tothe testimony of Hindus:"With a scoff of your keyboard, with near complete ignorance of  the testimonies, are you going to say that that is all complete  hooey?"If you do so "scoff," then how do you objectively justify your own specialpleading?Second, it is not at all clear that King Solomon or King David testified toJesus.  You can claim it to be clear, but that does not make it true. Third, it is quite arguable that Abraham Lincoln was not Christian, and thathe had both a public and a private view of Christianity.  In fact there wasmuch discussion about it in his day (yes, he was publically accused of being adeist.  Oh my).  I am presently collecting a FAQ for Lincoln as I'vepreviously done for Tyre, Jefferson and etc.  Later,Dave Butler    "My earlier views of the unsoundness of the Christian scheme of      salvation and the human origin of the scriptures, have become      clearer and stronger with advancing years and I see no reason for      thinking I shall ever change them."Abraham LincolnTo Judge J S Wakefield after the death of Willie Lincoln.

I knowyour Bible provides wonderful stories of the things he said and did,but I simply do not believe that he still exists as an entity that hasany bearing on this universe or the lives in it, and I similarly donot believe that the god that you worship exists or has ever existed.Period.I view religion in general and Christianity in specific as a 'culturalvirus' that has been passed down from generation to generation becausepeople are often too afraid to think for themselves and claimresponsibility for their own fate, so they brainwash themselves andtheir children into believing the popular myths, and it goes on fromthere.  And eventually Christianity becomes a given -- if so manyother people believe in it, it must be right, no?I don't believe in any "life after death".  I believe that when I die,I die, so therefore it's up to me to try to bring meaning and purposeto my life in the meantime.  I don't believe that it's a good thing tohumble myself and view pride as a sin -- pride, in moderation, is aconstructive thing.  I see nothing at all wrong with homosexuality andnothing inferior about women, and my priests lost a lot of my trustwhen they patronizingly tried to explain the 'faults' of theseopinions to me.  I don't believe in 'loving everyone', especiallypeople I've never met; while I try to show respect to everyone, mylove and admiration is something not easily earned, and I do not feelguilty about denying my respect and consideration to someone who hasabused it.If you want me to take your religion the least bit seriously, stoptrying to show me how the Bible "makes sense".

First get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching to usabout "the only true God," whom you interpret according to your own likesand dislikes, but whose image I cannot reconcile with what I know aboutHim myself.  I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for otherfaiths, believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ, but in a differentway or fashion than your own.

On the contrary.

The indication from Rick is that they may#  certainly be.The issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis-represent or ridicule the lds church.  The issue of "official doctrine"is obviously very important.  McConkie's views have been controversial(e.g. "The Seven Deadly Heresies" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best,or erroneous at worst ("blacks not to receive the priesthood in thisdispensation").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuablecontribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personalinterpretations (his book "Mormon Doctrine" is oftentimes referred toas "McConkie's Bible" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I ratherlook to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books!(The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkiewas a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom ofGod than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepteddoctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation andspeculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his mostbiased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than thetrash coming from your proverbial pen.

The police strategy of bursting in with weapons drawn, clearly marked asofficers and yelling "Police" repeatedly.  This is used every day to bust drughouses.  The idea is to awe the suspects into submission with surprise anddisplay of firepowere in order to avoid a gun fight.  As for not knocking, it'sa sad necessity in many cases since the suspects will attempt to escape or evenfight.  Usually this strategy works; if it didn't, then it wouldn't be used socommonly, now would it?Whether or not it was appropriate to use this strategy on the BD is not mypoint, since I don't think any of us have enough information to make a clearjudgement on this issue.I merely point out that it IS a valid strategy which is used every day.Furthermore, we don't know of any substitute strategy capable of apprehendingpotentially dangerous and armed suspects.  Do you suggest that the policealways knock with guns holstered and never arrest any suspects until they havebeen allowed to inspect the officers's badges?  Just what should the police dowhen apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects?  How far can theyreasonably go to identiy themselves?  What do you suggest they can do whichcan't be faked by the "competition"?Even if you've got deadly enemies who may pretend to be cops, that's not anexcuse to murder police.

Cases in which their mental capacity is imnpaired.   Casesin which they err about the true value of what they are selling.Pretty soon you have to start talking about "informed owner""competent owner" "educated owner" and so on, and the conceptgets less and less clear and exceptions more and more plausible.But the real problem remains that of looking only at end-pointsin a context.    Maybe most of us will agree with you that a pebble is "small" and that the Moon is "big", but that does not mean thatyou have an objective measuring scale.   Only that these two are fairly common opinions *in context*.An astronomer may claim that the Moon is actually "tiny" anda micro-biologist may remark that a pebble is "huge".   Similarly,if an armed Serbian offers a helpless Bosnian a dollar and his life for his land, rather than killing him and taking it for free, the Bosnian may consider that he is getting quite a good deal.jon.

I would expect this kind of behaviorfrom the Evangelical Born-Again Gospel-Thumping In-Your-Face We're-The-Only-True-Christian Protestants, but I have always thought that Catholics behaved better than this.Friend Dennis, I urge you to follow the example of your fellowCatholics, of who I count many dozens as my friends, and practiceyour faith through good example and decent living and respectfor the common humanity of others. Please do not stoop to thelevel of the E B-A G-T I-Y-F W-T-O-T-C Protestants, who thinkthat the best way to witness is to be strident, intrusive, loud,insulting and overbearingly self-righteous.The imagery in the Song of Solomon is a little bit dated (get it? Middle East - date palms - oh, never mind) but apparently acceptable, on a steaminess level, to be accepted as part of the canon. Fromthis fact I derive that erotica itself is not incompatible withCatholic doctrine.Is there such a thing as Catholic erotica? Not necessarily a lovestory between people of that faith, but a love story that is notexploitative, does not seek redemption through penis size, paysproper respect to the dignity of each partner, and is still eroticenough to have a place on a.s.s.I would submit that the _Darknites_ series of stories qualify, alsomost of the _Journal Entries_, and _Rings I and II_.I would guess that your aim is to cut down on the pornography andincrease the erotica. I actually agree with you that nearly all ofthe "I've got an enormous dick, and I shot my wad all over her face"stories are crap. I count them as noise, which makes my take on thesignal-to-noise ration much lower than many other people's.Since you are one of the few posters here who can actually write decent prose, could you write a few stories for us instead ofoverwhelming us with commentary?  > Anyway, this is a big subject.

Any Messianic pretenderwould tell his followers to get ready for war, since theywere going to throw the Romans out of Judaea and free theIsraelites.For those interested, Bar Kochba's claim was taken far moreseriously than Jesus' among the Jews.  They revolted and600,000 were slaughtered by the Romans.  His claim was onlyrejected after his defeat, although for a short time he lookedas though he would win.  They even got to mint coins beforethe Romans triumphed.Now how that has played into Christianity is rather interestinggiven your use of the statement attributed to Jesus.  Did Koreshfigure he had to get rid of the US government to free Israel?Had he the foggiest notion of who are todays descendants ofthe Israelites?

You like those conclusions?>I don't.I think that you are changing the meaning of "values" here. Perhapsit is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.value n. 1. A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goodsor service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in usefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or qualityconsidered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, asof a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus. The relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness orlightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speechsound. In context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In termsof scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note thatthese definitions do not mean the same thing.In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of areach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of theword "value" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standardof measurement. I would conclude that science does not have itsbasis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if oneconcludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based onsystems derived from observation, then it must follow that in ascientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as"objective values."Back to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow.Just because the word "values" is used in both contexts does not meanthat there is a relationship between the two contexts.If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one mustfirst start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Consideringthe meaning of the word "objective" I doubt that this will ever happen.So, back to the original question:And objective morality is.....?If you can provide an objective foundation for "morality" then that willbe a good beginning.>-- >Frank O'Dwyer                                  'I'm not hatching That'>odwyer@sse.ie                                  from "Hens",  by Evelyn Conloneric
