(which is how it should be) So until the Phils AT LEAST     have a good year, not just a good 2 weeks, they won't get any respect  either. BTW, Atlanta's .188 BA is actually a compliment to how good  the Braves really are. Their record is 6-3. Can you imagine the Phils  record if they were batting .188? hahahaha. And Atlanta's hitting will  improve dramatically.    No, I'm not a Braves fan. Just defending a good team.   Orin.

While you fromyour armchair may disagee, I don't.  I think there is a lot ofevidence to suggest the decision they made.  I predicted it amonglarge guffaws from several at the start of spring training.  Ithink it is a very *normal* decision to have made.  It is certainlymore reversible than to have started Lopez in the bigs and havereleased one of their catchers.  Sure, it may be conservative.  Itmay also be logical.

The bats will come alive, and the Braves will come around.The pitching is solid, and as long the Braves don't have serious injuriesto the starting rotation, they'll continue to pitch well.  Heck, withthe five starters on the Braves rotation, they could even sustain aninjury to one of the five (I hope this doesn't happen, though).The bats are there... Pendleton will certainly bat over .280, Justiceis catching fire, Bream, Nixon, Sanders, Gant... well, there's toomuch offense there to be kept quiet for much longer.  Right now, theCleveland Indians have 7 players batting over .300!  But I certainlywouldn't their seven for our respective seven (though wouldn't theBraves be something right now with their pitching and 7 players battingover .300?).The bullpen... well, it IS suspect.  But when the bats come alive, theguys in the bullpen will be of less concern.So anyway, I believe the Braves will be tough to beat this season.  I'mnot saying the Braves have automatically won the division, but I'm optim-istic about their season (though it's awful painful to watch them attimes right now).Go Braves!!!Dean.

Iremember seeing a Pete Rose rookie card, and unless I miss myguess he was wearing the exact same duds.  The Mets (HOW ABOUT DOC'S PERFORMANCE TODAY?!!!!!) havereinserted the Mets patch on the shoulder, and changed the Metsinsgnia on the front of the jersey.  To my knowledge it is thefirst time that has been changed since 1962, and it reminds mea little of the Dodger logo.  Many teams have opted for a return to a previous styleof uniform, or at least uniforms that look more traditional.(Phillies, Reds, Expos, White Sox, Padres, etc.) and the oncebright colors have been altered to gray.  The trend has alsoseen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of theearly years, as opposed to the cookie-cutter saucer stadiumsconstrucrted throughout the sixties.With salaries now reaching unbelievable highs, no onein the comissioner's office, and inter-league play on thehorizon, it's nice to see that baseball at least looks like itwas meant to be.

It was six runs in the 8th for a 12-5 win Monday and five inthe 8th and six in the 9th for a 12-2 win yesterday. Jamie Navarro pitchedseven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took partin the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado haspitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next loweston the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!It doesn't look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, whileThon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The nextbest hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team's only HR, at.238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the teamis 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/gameand giving up 6.6/game. Still, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense shouldcome around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gavethe Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo, Fetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to besuccessful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief eitherheld small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay,the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpenis a big question mark.In other news, Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday, while WilliamSuero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal.

I've combined those with myposition-adjusted MLV numbers to come up with first-approximation totalrun values for players last year.  We can use these as a springboard forreconsideration of the MVP award.Major caveats:  these numbers include no defensive park adjustment, so ifSan Diego really is just a question of odd scoring or gopher holes in theinfield, that will cause some inaccuracies.  The offensive numbers areposition-adjusted, but not park adjusted, so we have to deflate some andinflate others to be fair.  Finally, we still don't know what to do aboutcatchers, and I have no idea how to evaluate the defensive contributions of Tony Phillips and Bip Roberts.  Having said that, there are still some surprises.  Let's look NationalLeague first.  All numbers in total runs contributed over the season.PlayerOffenseDefenseTotalSandberg  44  32 76Bonds  67   3 70Walker  26  26 52Justice  14  33 47Daulton   44  ?? 44+?Larkin  36   4 40Grace  13  27 40As I see it, these are the legitimate MVP candidates from last season.If you deflate Sandberg's offense a wee bit for playing in Wrigley, youget essentially a dead heat.  Had Bonds been his usual defensive self, itwouldn't have been close, but that apparently wasn't the case.  DarrenDaulton needs 22 or more defensive runs to make up the offensive difference,and I couldn't tell you whether that's easy or impossible.  A good case could be made for any of Sandberg, Bonds, or Daulton as top dude.My personal vote:  Bonds, Sandberg, Daulton, Walker, Justice.In the American League:PlayerOffenseDefenseTotalVentura  22  34 56Martinez  47  -1 46B. Anderson   21  25 46Thomas  47  -5 42R. Henderson  25  16 41Raines  17  23 40Tettleton  33  ?? 33+?OK, let's see a show of hands: how many of you picked Robin Ventura as topplayer in the AL last year?  I certainly didn't, but I'd have a hard timearguing against him at this point.  Yes, I know these numbers are onlyapproximate, but that's a big gap between him and the #2 guy.  Also, thoseof you who thought Rickey Henderson stank last year are out of your minds.Once again, there's a catcher in the ointment.  If calling a game is asimportant as it might be, 23 runs is easy to make up (or give away).  TAkea guess, folks; I don't think we can do any better than that.My personal vote (excluding pitchers):Ventura, Tettleton, Anderson, Martinez, Henderson.I'm a big Frank Thomas fan, but I have to admit to a bias in favor ofbalanced offensive/defensive contribution, which should have a higherleverage in W/L record than an equal shift that is lots of offense withnegative defense.For the record:Carlos Baerga  27  5  32Roberto Alomar  35 -2  33Forget it; it's a wash.Let me also take this opportunity to admit that I was grossly wrong regardingDon Mattingly's defense this past season.  Don recovered brilliantly from hisweak '90 and '91 to end up withMattingly  -1  17  16 runswhich is clearly an above-average first baseman.  However, it's still 18 runsbehind Mark McGwire, 26 runs behind Frank Thomas, and 7 runs behind JohnOlerud.  On the other hand, it's ahead of Rafael Palmeiro, Cecil Fielder, andevery other AL first baseman not yet mentioned.--    David M.

One of them is the ERA statistic for: pitchers. What does it say ??ERA indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher pernine inning game.  Thus, if a pitcher pitched 3 innings and gave up 1 earnedrun, his 9 inning equivelent perfomance would be 3 earned runs, thus his ERAis 3.00.  To compute the ERA you simply take the number of earned runs dividedby the innings pitched and then multiple the result by 9.ERA = (ER/IP) * 9An earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributedto a fielding error.  More specifically, if an error occurs that representedthe third out, all runs scored after the error are considered UNEARNED runs.Earned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on basewhen the pitcher exited the game.  Here are some examples:If there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base.  Ifan error occurs that represents the third out, all of the runs afterthis error and NOT counted as earned runs.If a pitcher issues some base on balls (walks), and leaves the gamebefore the inning is completed, he is responsible for the people whowere left on base.  If the those runners who were left on base score,and the score was not a result of an error, those eraned runs areattributed to the pitcher who left the game.I hope this explains things for you.Joe

One over the minimum, twobases on ball in the first inning, one runner left, 95 pitches.  I listenedto the game on radio and listening to Dave Niehaus call the game was areal treat (as long as they keep Ron Fairly quite, I doubt if anyone isbetter than Niehaus -- but that Fairly guy is really annoying me).But, I guess if Clemens or Viola had been pitching, it would have been a different story :-)Two shutouts in two nights against the hottest, best hitting team inMajor League baseball ....  Pretty impressive in any league.Man, if Johnson, Bosio and Hanson keep going the Mariners could be a really interesting team to follow this year.  Also, John Cummings (rookie)has had three solid outings with no support.  If Fleming comes back this may be the best starting staff in the American League this year(relief is another story, though - grimace).Too cool.  The first no-hitter that I have been able to follow from start to end.  And again, I think Niehaus will win some kind of awardfor the way he called the game.

First is that the way the sun was shining in Miami, it had a summeratmosphere in early spring for baseball.  In comparison Wrigley Fieldin early April still has a wintry look to it with the dead ivy andbundled up fans.  The second and most important was the fans.  I like these guys/gals!I will admit I am a football fan first but I still enjoy baseball.It was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed tothe Miami Dolphins.  The way they were cheering, I thought it was theAFC playoffs.  Of course opening day may have A LOT to do with it,but I really got feeling of electricity that I think is lacking witha lot of baseball fans in other cities.  Baseball certainly needs a charge and I hope these two expansionteams bring back some excitement.  We'll find out Friday how DenverBronco fans respond. Phillies are 2-0!

I hearthe FAN at night wherever I go (the signal used to be WNBC, when theyplayed golden oldies) because you can't avoid it.  Of those three,WIP has the best hosts hands down.  Chuck Cooperstein isn't a homer,and neither is Jody Mac.  WTEM is too generic to be placed in thecatergory.  In fact if you have heard WTEM and the FAN you notice thetheme music is identical...same ownership?? I think so!  WIP istotally original.

I finally heard him last summer and he wasn't the sameguy.  Those NY fans got to him.  I was glad to hear him back inPhilly when I went to see a few Eagles games.  I will admit, I am  die hard EAGLES fan and WIP is basically anEagles station 365 days a year.  BUT, I bet you the Phillies are incontrol right now.About the knock on G. Cobb, I like him.  He knows the Eagles like abook.  I remember the weekend before they went to play San Fran,(when everyone thought the Eagles would be blown away) Cobb said thatthe Eagles usually play their best when no one believe they can win.Well they were inches shy of pulling the victory.

I can't remember the exact details, but the stadium would bebuild practically downtown.  There is a small lot that could be used,according to the paper.  The 30th street plan has run into some trouble,because Amtrak does not want to reroute some of its lines in order toaccomodate the stadium.  I don't have an opinion just yet, just lettingeveryone know that there are really two options being discussed right now.Neither of these plans will be put into effect very soon, however, becausenobody wants to pay for it :-)--    Keith KellerLET'S GO RANGERS!!!!!LET'S GO QUAKERS!!!!!kkeller@mail.sas.upenn.eduIVY LEAGUE CHAMPS!!!!

What would he have to do to please you guys, bat 1.000?>You can hardly claim that he is "hurting his team".It would help if his OBP were higher than his batting average. Yes, theApril 12 USA Today lists Le Grand Chapeau as having a .422 batting averageand a .413 OBP. That's on 19-for-45 hitting with 0 (zip, nil, nada) walks.The reason a lot of us are down on Galarraga is that he's has a long historyof showing that this is nowhere near his real level of ability (except fordrawing walks). If he hit .400 for, say, even 250 AB's I'd be convinced thatthere was a real change in his ability. If he did it with an OBP<AVG, I'dnot only be amazed but I'd make a bet that that would be a unique feat inthe history of the game. But what do 45 AB's prove? Look at some of theother fluke players at this point in the season:  Player    AVG AB  Blauser  .367 49  Grace    .391 48  Milligan .400 35  Conine   .375 40  Lansing  .400 50  Slaught  .406 32Are any of these guys really that good? Well, in a word, no. How significantis Galarraga's average? At the 45 AB level, a hit is worth about .020. Ifhe'd had one of those hits called an error and one taken away by a gooddefensive play, he'd be in the .380 range. If he goes 0-for-4 in his nextgame he's all the way down to .388. In one game. Come back in June. Let'stalk then.>If it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches>and he starts making lots of outs (as someone speculated might happen),>*THEN* I would agree with you that he isn't taking enough pitches. My comment>that "he isn't paid to walk" doesn't mean that he should have a license>to swing at bad pitches and make outs; it's more along the lines of: he's>batting .400 and leading the league in RBI's so what bloody difference>does it make if he isn't drawing  a lot of walks? Sheesh.It's history, Greg. Andres' history is that he doesn't walk much because heswings at bad pitches, so his average isn't very good. 45 AB's doesn't meanan awful lot compared to a history of a couple of thousand, especially whenthere's ample evidence (0 BB in 1992) that his basic hitting approach hasn'tchanged. Yeah, he might suddenly have turned into a .400 hitter who neverwalks, but don't bet the rent money on it.

Being me, of course, Iused equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth,and I calculated both rate of performance (fielding equivalentaverage) and total performance (fielding equivalent runs). But Icompared, not to the average player, but the replacement player, andhere's why: because the positional adjustment comes built in to thesystem. In the AL of 1992, the average SS is 32.9 runs abovereplacement (RAR); cf, 31.6; 2B, 28.8; 3B, 26.3; LF, 26.0; RF, 24.6;1B, 16.9. We may quibble with the exact numbers, but the order lookssubstantially right.In the equivalent average, I have always set league average to .235. Ihad decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of.180; the name of that replacement level hitter, often as not, is"Billy Ripken". I decided to let the replacement level fielder be thesame distance from .235 as .180, but in the opposite direction as Ihave set it up; that makes for an eqa of .280. (Yes, I can add. Runsare proportional to eqa squared; the difference between 180 squaredand 235 squared equals the difference to 279 squared, and I roundedoff for simplicity). An all-replacement fielding team would have:Randy Milligan at first (.282), Willie Randolph (.269) at second, LeoGomez (.279) at third, Walt Weiss (.269) at short, Kevin Bass (.271)in left, HoJo (.257) in center, and Eric Anthony (.277) in right. Ugh.So, the total number of RAR for a player is the sum of his batting andfielding RAR. I can rate them by total RAR, or RAR per some number ofbatting outs, like 400. An average player has a total RAR of about 55,30 batting, 25 fielding.Total RAR (bat/field)1. Bonds      152 (124/28)  Ventura    124 (66/58)2. Sandberg   143 (88/55)   Thomas     122 (110/12)3.

It was the Phils only win in the three game series, andwas the first time the Phillies have lost a series in the youngseason.   The Phils jumped to a 6-0 lead in the game thanks to 2John Kruk 2-run homers and two Wes Chamberlain homers.  However DannyJackson, and the Phillies middle relief was unable to hold the lead.Mitch Williams entered the game with the Phillies leading 8-4,however Candy Maldonado hit a ninth inning homerun to tie it.  Inthe 11th, Dave Hollins hit a three-run shot, his first of the yearto push the Phils ahead to stay.  However, in a shaky bottom of the11th the Cubs scored 2 runs and had the tying runner on base whenthe Cubs pinch hit Randy Myers for Bob Scanlan (they were out ofposition players) and Myers bunted into a double play to end thegame.The Phils bring their league leading 9-3 record back to actionTuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday against the Padres.

The above data is for a 4-year period ending last season.Last season Samuel batted .272 while Sabo hit .244 (not park adjusted).This season they are both hitting below .200, albeit Sabo with moreat bats.  I will agree that over his career Sabo has been a betterhitter than Samuel, but I will also remind you that Samuel has beena better hitter in certain situations than Sabo.I did not predict that Sabo would choke, nor that Samuel would get ahit.

He had a very good year at Louisville before coming up to the majors.  As I recall, the hype on Pagnozzi coming upin the organization was good hit, decent fielding.

The Twins took two of three games in the series,with scores as follows:                  Tuesday April 20th    MN  10                                        Mil  0                   Winning Pitcher Banks (2-0)                    Wednesday April 21st  Mil 10  (10)                                        MN   8                    LP  - Hartley ( 0-1 )                  Thursday April 22nd   MN  5                                        Mil 4                    WP - Deshaies (4-0)                    Sa - AguileraHighlight/Low Lights of the Series:------------------------------------Jim Deshaies continues to be the surprise of not only the Twins, but ofthe American League as well.  Going into today's game, Deshaies was 3-0with a 1.74 ERA.  Deshaies allowed 2 Earned runs in 6 2/3 innings, meaninghis ERA will climb slightly.  Deshaies, who came to MN via a trade withPhiladelphia which sent David West there, continues to make Andy MacPhaillook like a true genius.Willie Banks has put together two solid starts for the Twins, going 6.1 inningson Monday while coasting on solid Twins hitting.  Deshaies and Banks now combine for 6 of the Twins eight victories, while Tapani/Mahomes/Erickson are0-5.Wednesday's game marked the first opposing left-handed starting pitcher for theTwins this year (Rickey Bones).  The Twins teed off against both him and subsequent relief, including a Grand Slam by Kent Hrbek which pushed the leadto 7-3.  The Twins pitching staff could not hold the lead, though, allowing4 walks in the 7th inning, 2 of which scored and coming with bases loaded.Tapani gave up one walk before being relieved, Guthrie two walks, and MikeHartley one walk before the inning was over.  This tied the game at 7-7, andthe Brew Crew rocked Mike Hartley for 3 runs in the top of the tenth to winit.Aguilera continues to be shaky against the Brew Crew.  6 of 20 career blownsaves have come against the Brew Crew, and today's game was shaky as well.Coming into the ninth with a 5-2 lead, Aguilera gave up a solo HR to Vaughn,then hits to Darryl Hamilton and Dickie Thon before finally retiring theside.  Once again, the tying run made it to second base on Aggie.Weak hearted Twins fans are advised not to watch Aggie in the ninth.General News-------------------------------------Pedro Munoz continues to improve as an outfielder, playing in left field onTuesday's game.  He continues to bat weakly against right handed pitching,though, which has limited his playing time.  Gene Larkin and JT Bruett(formerGopher) have been playing right field, as both can bat left handed.The Twins begin a three game series with the Detroit Tigers tomorrow.  StartingPitching is tentatively scheduled as Erickson, Mahomes, Banks.  The DetroitTigers have had TWO 20 run games in the last ten days, and should provide quite a challenge to the young MN pitching staff.The Twins have 9 HR's this year, three each from Puckett, Hrbek, and Winfield,the third, fourth, and fifth batters, respectively.Brian Harper pegged 4 of the first 6 baserunners attempting to steal secondthis year, and shows much improvement in this category.Jim Deshaies has three pick-offs and one balk this year.  Some say he has the best 1st base move in baseball.  This move has enabled him to pitchout of some tight early jams, and has certainly contributed to his 4-0 start.  Watch to see if umpiring crews began calling the balk more tightlyin response to opposing team complaints about his leg kicking behind therubber on the pick-off move.Current MLB AL West Standings( from Joesph Hernandez, jtchern@ocb.berkeley.edu  )AMERICAN WEST         Won  Lost   Pct.

I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols' Law of catcherdefense), but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove fromyour viewpoint or mine. About the only tangible thing we can look at isopponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners.Catchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases.   As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another bigbat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is thatthey're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliardplays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak defensively if Blauser plays. I'd like to see the Braves give at least one ofMel Nieves, Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot, but much like the talent-richJays of recent years they'll be conservative and stick with what they have. I'm not saying that's wrong, just conservative.  -- Dave Hung Like a Jim Acker Slider Kirsch      Blue Jays - Do it again in '93 kirsch@staff.tc.umn.edu                        New .. quotes out of context!"Not to beat a dead horse, but it's been a couple o' weeks .. this  disappoints me..punishments..discharges..jackhammering.." - Stephen Lawrence

Seems only the SDCNs realize how much baseball isa *team* game, combining efforts from every player for the win.Consider the Red Sox game last night.  The Sox won 4-3 in the bottomof the 13th.  Who won the game?-Clemens pitched a strong nine (?) innings, allowing only two runs.-Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings, though he needed some excellent defensive plays behind him to do so.-Quantrill pitched a couple of innings, gave up the go-ahead run, and got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of the inning.Looks like a team effort to me!  Yet only Quantrill got credit forthe win.How about the offense?-Dawson and Vaughn hit (I think) HRs early in the game.  Without either one, the Sox would have lost in nine.-Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single.-Zupcic pinch-ran for Quintana, providing the speed to go from first to third when...-Cooper ripped a *second* single in the inning.-Melvin avoided the DP, getting the run home with a sac fly.  Not much of a help, but it was something.-Scrub Richardson then hit a double, scoring the speedy Cooper all the way from first!  (Hill's lack of defense helped.)Cooper and Zupcic were credited with runs, Melvin and Richardson werecredited with RBIs.  But it seems to me that it was Quintana's hitthat set up the whole inning!  And did Melvin really contribute asmuch as Richardson?Furthermore, people seem to consider RBIs to be more significant thanruns.  Did Melvin contribute more than Cooper?  Cooper provided thegame-winning baserunner, and moved the tying run to third base withonly one out!Assigning credit based on Runs and RBIs is clearly ridiculous.  Youcan argue that OBP and SLG don't show you who came through in theclutch, but R&RBI don't do any better.  At least OBP and SLG don't*claim* to try to tell you that.Here's to the Red Sox who contributed to last night's victory.All 20 of them!-Valentine

As muchas fans want to catch a ball, they really should be aware that winningthe game is more important.  As a Dodger fan, he has to be aware thatthis is the home stadium, and that entails helping the home team winin any way possible.  As soon as the ball was hit that far, his firstinstinct should be to root for Darryl to catch it, not to try to catchit himself, particularly when he is sitting that close.I enjoy the attitude of the Wrigley fans, where they are against visiting team home runs so much, they actually throw them back on thefield.Now, this has nothing to do with whether Darryl could have caught it ornot.  Sure, he probably screwed up, but the fan should realize hisfirst responsibility is to get out of the way and help the team win.Danieldaniel@caldera.usc.edu

First, my apologies for perhaps being untimely with this subject material and perhaps overly optimistic in my request, but here goes anyhow:I'm *very* interested in finding out how I might be able to get two tickets for the All Star game in Baltimore this year. My very aged folks live about 50 miles away and I know it would be a great thing for them to attend the game. I went with them, and my grandfather who got me into baseball as a small child, to the All Star game in DC many years ago. Although I'm now in the SF Bay Area, I'd *love* to be able to treat my folks to this game; it's absolutely the last chance they'd ever have to attend this game locally.Any info would be greatly appreciated!!!!Mary Colemcole@informix.com

He addressedthis exact issue, and dismissed it rather quickly.  According to Gammons,advanced scouts are reporting that Morris' fastball and slider still havethe same zip and that his problems this year are due to his sudden inabilityto keep the ball hidden during his release.  Guzman and Stottlemyre havegone through similar stretches that have been cleared up succinctly by alittle work with the pitching coach.  Gammons looks to see Morris back intop form within the month.I, on the other hand, still have my doubts.  Morris' ERA last year wasrather high for a pitcher who won 20 games.  His showing in the Series wasnot surprising.  Although I'm not convinced that he's washed up, I have mydoubts as to whether or not he can ever regain the form he had for theTwins in '91.-Brian Klaff

Perhaps it appeared differently at the ballpark.  Personally,I was amazed that Gant didn't get ejected.  But that's why Cox did;it's called protecting your players.And to those people who would have thrown everyone out of the game,all I can say is that you'd be making baseball history.  Even inthe worst baseball brawls, usually only the major instigators areejected, not everyone who comes onto the field.  And I'd have to say that those brawls are considerably more threatening to the game than what the Braves did Fri. night.Anyhow, that's my last two cents on the subject, barringoutrageous postings.  I will try to keep my eyes openfor more incidents involving Hirschbeck. I think there willbe some with other teams as well.  I hope not.Eric

I've suffered with all kinds of insults (astypical for the net), but give me a break. Galarraga is currentlybatting over .400 and you guys are complaining that he isn't drawingenough walks.  What would he have to do to please you guys, bat 1.000?You can hardly claim that he is "hurting his team".If it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitchesand he starts making lots of outs (as someone speculated might happen),*THEN* I would agree with you that he isn't taking enough pitches. My commentthat "he isn't paid to walk" doesn't mean that he should have a licenseto swing at bad pitches and make outs; it's more along the lines of: he'sbatting .400 and leading the league in RBI's so what bloody differencedoes it make if he isn't drawing  a lot of walks?

The Marinershad the bases loaded with 1 out.  The batter hits a fly to center, which thefielder catches.  The runner at third tags and scores without a throw.  Now, without a judgement call (and I don't think there is one), this is an RBIfor the batter.  It seems to me that a better name for this would be "defensiveindifference", since it doesn't really matter whether the guy at third scoresat that point.  (I know, I can think of several "If the Mariners stole thirdand second, which opening the base would allow, and then the batter hit agrounder which the third baseman gets deep in the hole between himself andthird, he wouldn't have a play at home, third, or second for the out, andmaybe he therefore can't make the throw to first to get the last out, etc...scenarios, too.  But does it _really_ matter if this guy scores this way whenyou're down by 4?  If the tying run is going to score, so is the guy on third.)The point is that the batter (IMO) shouldn't get "credit" (an RBI) for utterlyfailing to do his job - which at this point is to get a hit or a walk, nottrade an out for one run.  What do you guys think?Regards,Burke (Charles S. Homan)choman@wpi.wpi.eduGo Red Sox!!!  (11-3)Go Rocket! (3-0)

WithMike Illitch at the head and Ernie Harwell back at the booth, the tiger batswill bang this summer.  Already they have scored 20 runs in two games and withFielder, Tettleton, and Deer I think they can win the division.  No pitching!Bull!  Gully, Moore, Wells, and Krueger make up a decent staff that will keepthe team into many games.  Then there is Henneman to close it out.

Even putting aside any other factors,a player with a 51 point edge in OBP is more productive than a player witha 28 point edge in SLG. The issue has been studied before, and I doubt youcould come up with any convincing argument the other way. People see the batting average and the HR, but they don't really know  their value is worth unless they've studied the issue closely. The fact is thatBaerga ate up a LOT more outs than Alomar; while Baerga was making outs,Alomar was drawing walks and being on base for Carter, Winfield et.al.Gord Niguma(fav player: John Olerud)

A manager, much like a military officer,needs to have his (her) players' complete obedience and respect duringa game.  After the game, it's no big deal, but when there is no time to do more than react, players must trust the manager or the team oftenfalls apart (see: Boston Red Sox, ff. :) )  Strawberry's demeanor as represented by the media, often sounds likedemands.  I suspect that a comment like "I enjoy hitting fourth; I'mused to it" would get pretty brutally misinterpreted by the media ifit came from Strawberry.  Russ Porter quoted Strawberry as saying,"I feel more comfortable hitting cleanup and I think I perform bestin that role."  (Paraphrased by my memory and bias.)  That seems likea fairly non-petulant answer to what was almost certainly a question like, "How do you feel about being moved to the third spot in the order?"A more media-sensitive player might answer "The manager knows what he isdoing.  If he thinks that batting me third will help the team, then Iam all for it."  We'd ignore that answer as brown stuff, so it seems alittle bit of an overreaction to brand Darryl's response as petulant.Personally, I think his argument is nonsense and that it really doesn'tmatter much in which order the #2-5 players in the order are batted,except for personal stats.  If I were Darryl, I'd probably answer thatquestion, "The number four spot gets a few more RBI opportunities and I getpaid for RBIs.  I think it is best for me to bat fourth, but I am willingto hit third if Tommy thinks it will benefit the team."  or something likethat.  It would be helpful at salary time--my RBIs were down because I washitting third--and make him sound like a "team" player.  Since Strawberrywill not likely go through arbitration, but use the free agent market forhis next contract, maybe that argument is useless, but it would help   his image with the media without appearing to be totally content-free.Remember, the media is of the belief that one's best RBI man should hitfourth, so the argument is sensible, regardless of whether or not it istrue.--Jeff

Tapani and Erickson are also young, and have looked very good this spring.  The last spot was between Jim Deshaies, formerly of Houston and S.D. and Mike Trombley.  Deshaies hasn't looked very good this spring, so I believe that the spot has gone to Trombley, although they hadn't wanted 3 starters this unproven. I personally believe very highly in Mahomes and Trombley.>>2.  Who is playing short and third?Well, Scott Leius is the shortstop.  He played mostly 3B last year, but was a SS in the minors, and moved back after Gagne left to K.C.  3B is split (maybe) between Pagliarulo, who has had a great spring, and Terry Jorgenson, a good looking kid who has languished in Portland for 3 years.  I'm not sure how the time will be divided, but they seem to be happy with what they have here.  I like Jorgenson, but I fear they might give too much time to Pags. >3.  How's Winfield doing?Sorry, can't help you here.Dennis

One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader."What could be better," declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubsare challenging?     "It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked," announcedRyne Sandberg.  "If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, orBunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able towin.     "Lord, I hope we pull it off."     The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, PeteRose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cutthe ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threwto Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.     Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose tothird.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let himbeat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks thisyear.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into agap in right-center.  "Cool Papa" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball offand prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boonegrounded out to second, ending the threat.       "Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt orTorrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure onKlein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spellsRose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able tosustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times."  So came theanalysis from Frank Chance.     The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' groundermoved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singledhome a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Kleinsingled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen poppedout of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs,Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense.He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hittingfor Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded intoa 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring astrikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quickTrillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced apop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  TheCubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.     Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To getanother righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlockplayed third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpenwas worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead againstLefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, drivinghome four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler addedanother, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpenhad more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 moreruns to ice an 11-7 triumph.     Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at onepoint, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, offRobin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, butthe Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  BruceSutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in theeighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and wouldconclude their series with the Expos on Monday.-------------------------------------------------------------------     Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st     Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday.The Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among theall-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their firstfirst two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out offirst in this wacky season.     Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2Saturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday.The Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled SteveRogers 3-2.  "We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of ourteam speed," remarked Lou Brock.  "I don't see why we can't win thisdivision."     The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds ofthe way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first.-------------------------------------------------------------------     New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs,now 2 back - but in 4th!    "When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in apitcher's park like this," spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  KeithHernandez added that "their defense takes away quite a few runs per year,and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins."  The Pirates have made only26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tendto be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.     Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshoneSeaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  WhenNolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, thePirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the.500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  BertBlyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessedfantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on homeruns - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by RalphKiner for the Pirates.  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in thetop of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after MookieWilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner onfirst, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with KentTekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds inleft field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcingStrawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing thePirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulveallowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the rightfield line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who enteredto pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deepcenter, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-parkhomer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins,and had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go.------------------------------------------------------------------     San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5):     Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giantsmanaged to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some startingpitching that just wouldn't tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw,"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this comingweek, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while."     Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette andthe Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschelfaced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves' park had been a homerhaven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13.Willie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and DonBaylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott hadone each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday'sdoubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of theNational League record.  They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace.They had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win afterretiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, butfaltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.     In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in thefirst game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as theBraves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score.The homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell tothree game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely.-------------------------------------------------------------------     San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced EwellBlackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rathergood.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, thetrade looked even better.  McGriff's batting average was even rising.  Ofcourse, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in theoutfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.     Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched twohome runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and RayNarleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled SatchelPaige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game wasscoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was workinghis second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out andJoe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home,and the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled theGiants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highlyemotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them.-------------------------------------------------------------------     Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):     Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in thewide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill inthe first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  "Normally," Drysdale remarked, "Iwould be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can't affordto with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can'tafford to let the Astros beat us."  He then winked and said: "Well, maybeDavis will get decked once."     The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) isprimarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that hiscurrent pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team isa little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo isthe main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threwtwo runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware ofthe nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall allaround the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  Thefoul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away,with center field at 420 feet.  "It's as if some three-year-old threw atantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hithome runs'," remarked Roy Campanella.     The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalizethe Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway,Davis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings,according to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via theBaltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded witha two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and theAstros didn't score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth toerase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatenedto do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent.Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.     "I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop," he explained.     "How can we do that," Pee Wee Reese wondered.     "They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready tothrow on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but Iwant all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We'll go witha shallow infield almost the whole time."     The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eightinnings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doranpushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second andthird.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  TheDodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as NolanRyan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  FernandoValenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers'thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.     "We're mostly a power team," remarked Ron Cey.  "Jackie and, when heplays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple otherplays can do it now and then.  We're sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  Iguess that's why they're so successful there."  Indeed, it seems thatbasestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The 'Strosswiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.

Joe Morgan thinks that Bonds-Clark-Williams should be the 3-4-5 hitters.  While he believes that Clark-Bonds-Williams is fine, he definitely is of the opinion that Bonds should hitahead of Williams.  I am inclined to agree with him.Your first reason is not valid because Bonds can hit both lefties and rightiesvery well.  He hits lefties or righties better than any other GiantWilliams is still getting breaking balls although not as much as last season.But, the bottom line is Bonds is a far more disciplined and more productivehitter than Williams, and I prefer to take my chances with Bonds driving inthe 1, 2 or 3 hitters (who are expected to have high OBPs) than with Williams.Williams would get more fastballs with Bonds on first and second base openbecause of the threat of Bonds stealing.

As a long time Red Soxfan, I will simply say:  The Impossible Dream Year - 1967 for those of youwith short memories. short lives, or both.  To be a Red Sox fan is to continually be the subject of abuse and criticismfrom those who only follow 'the hot team'.  This statement is supported basedon the increased number of 'Brave Woofers' out on the net.  A true fan of a team, any team, will follow that team through the good years as well as the leanyears, and be amply rewarded when the time is right.  Yeah, so what if Buckner let a roller go through his legs in `86.  Who cares ifClemens told Cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower.  Thefact is, they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fanssupported them.  Now that it appears that they are on lean times, the number of detracters come from all over.  So what!  Let them play and we will see what happens come September.  The Red Sox may not be that good, but they are certainly not that bad, either and they do have a chance to win the World Series, after all,remember the `69 Mets?  Who would have given them a chance to even make it thatfar, let alone beat Baltimore.Let's face it, Baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than Footballand Basketball.

I would rather have the untriedrookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has provenhimself to be average at best. I don't care if he is 15; if he playsbetter than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decentminor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and LasVegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average majorleague hitter (which is good for a catcher, I'll admit). Santiago'snumbers would probably come out the same as Sandy's, but I don't havethe league data from the mid-80s to check it out.That being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least tostart the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor leagueseason in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, verypoorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhillare not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers,they are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around.220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs onthe Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year wasjust as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87.

Granted, I thought his behavior withMcCarver last year was completely bush. Last year was the first timehe ever got 300 AB in one place, so his lines are hard to read. But hehas a combined 720 OPS in minor league play; with his speed is morevaluable than the OPS alone indicates; and at a still young age (24),had a monster year with an 868 OPS. He has a total, major and minor,EQA of .249; above major league average, and above average for CF(which was about .240 in the NL last year). He has shown at least thepotential of going into the .290s, which would make him one of the 15best hitters in the league. He has two full seasons before reachinghis "prime" season of 27. He should be considered as a legitimateprospect, and not as a simple side-show attraction.

As Aaron, Robinson, and Ott.        In terms of PEAK, and I repeat PEAK years, Winfield has Done it  all. He has batted in the 340's for a season, drove in 100 and more runs  many times in a row before his injury. Consistently hit at or near 300  while knocking in 35 home runs. Have you even LOOKED at Dave Winfield's  slugging percentage for three or 4 of his best seasons. I still think that  dave was one of the BETTER of all time, but obviously not the best. He was  one of the best athletes evr to play baseball. He hit line drives that hit  the scoreboard in left-center field, a feat np one has done in the new  Stadium. Heck, only 2 or 3 other people have hit it over that green fence  since it has been remodeled. He could field, had a bullet arm, and his  hitting was comparable in many seasons to gary sheffields, and barry bonds  of last season. He is older now, and slowing down, takes more of an  uppercut to lift the ball out of the park, but he will always be my hero,  and my idol. There is nothing that could make me happier than George  inviting Dave back to the Bronx to play his last year of ball with the  Yankees. Of course, he will most likely refuse the offer, but who knows?  For 3 million dollars, he'll play. Heck they are giving gallego 2.5  million this year, having Dave as their DH, while leaving him time to play  the field when Tartabull is injured, or Nokes and mass are traded, should  give the Yanks the inspiration and leadership that will sweep in a new age  of Yankee domination.Michael Lurie

Anyone else catch ESPN's piece aboutprospects and the relationship between age, career length, MVPs and Hall ofFame members? It was part of their preseason special. Basically, they looked at players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or ABs) by the time theywere 24, and noticed some interesting things.   For starters, they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs inthe history of the game. They also found out such players represented themajority of the players in the hall of fame. The kicker, though, was thatthey actually did some number-crunching and found that such players' careerslasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. They also  found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance andproduced over twice the raw totals (HRs, etc) of the other players. The firstgroup outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw BA, and blew awaythe second group in such categories as HRs, 2Bs, RBIs, etc.   It was the most impressive thing I've seen on ESPN in recent memory.

Take, for example, MarkMcGwire. He walked 90 times in 1993. If that's not a potential great exampleof what you're talking about then I don't know what is. Now let's look atwhat happens when McGwire doesn't walk:  75% of the time he made an out.  10% of the time he hit a single.  5% of the time he hit a double.  10% of the time he hit a homer.Now, you're pitching against McGwire. Would you trade 20 walks for 2 homers,1 double, 2 singles, and 15 outs? I would. Why give him the base when youcan get him out 3 times out of 4?Then there are guys like Alex Cole, who has a career .363 OBP eventhough he's never had a batting average over .300 (he did hit .300 in227 AB in 1990) or hit a single home run. Yep, that's right, he's*never* hit a homer in 916 AB's through the end of 1992. Who'd beafraid to throw a strike to him?

It was the gamewhere Pendelton broke up the scoreless tie in the ninth with a two-out,two-run homer to right to win it.  (It wasn't the game where the fans threw the give-away "fotoballs" onto the field in response to the homer --too bad, huh?)Well, the 'Stick is still cold.  The Saturday game ended at 5:45pm, and itwas cold then.  I can't imagine night games in April at the 'Stick.  Thewind kicked up a little, too, and I got this idea.At most games, there's a pile of hot dog wrappers and cups and trash onthe field a lot of the time.  I propose a Kid's Clean-up Corps composedmainly of 10-12 year old kids who would love nothing better than to runout on the field in the fifth inning (when the guy in the Toro smoothsthe infield) and grab the trash.It might not be glamorous, but at that age I probably would have givenanything to be on the field with the ballplayers.  Everybody wins here!Whaddaya think?Sean

Mesa (sp?) seems to be settling down. He pitched well against the Red Soxs, but The Rocket matched him.  I got achance to watch them play against California Wednesday and he pitched wellalso.  Then the dam broke.  Wickander came in and promptly it was 6-1.  (3run homer by Snow?).I heard the guys on ESPN say that 7 of the TRIBE's top 10 prospects arepitchers.

Don Baylor was his batting coach at St. Louis lastyear, and now, as his manager, is continuing to work with him.  Maybe Andreshas a "weak" left eye and the open stance gives him a better look at theball.  Or maybe it is simply improving his mechanics - I dunno.

Getready for him to have a monster year. He is now hitting the ball tothe opposite field with a lot of power to go with his natural power to right field and his good batting eye. If he stays healthywhich he should (his back is full strength this year) he shouldget over 100 RBI and close to 30 HR.In another note, the Marlins got off to a good start beating theDodgers. I believe the score was 6 - 3 but I'm not sure. I wishthem and the Rockies well this year. Hell. I think it would befunny to watch the Dodgers hit the cellar again this year.Dan Smith

The runner can leave his base at any time.  If the ball is caught,he's got to tag up.  If it isn't caught, he _doesn't_ have to tag up atall.  So, if he's feeling lucky, your runner at second can sprint for gloryas soon as the ball is popped up.  If it isn't caught, he's probably scoreda run.  If it is, he's probably headed for AAA.  The only effect the infield fly has is to make the batter out,thereby removing the force on the runners on base.  All other rules apply,as if you were standing second with first open and the ball is popped up.-- Tim Shippert                                 shippert@cco.caltech.edu"If we are going to stick to this damned quantum-jumping, then I regretthat I ever had anything to do with quantum theory."-E.

Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started with a solid single to right, moved to second on "Bob" Kelly's infield sneakerdown the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Branson's well-placed bunt--a rare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense.Cincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth.  He had only given up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off doubleby Vince Coleman.  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla afterJoe Orselak popped to short.  Orselak was pinch-hitting for Eddie Murray who argued plate umpire Kellogg's inside strike by "drawing the line" (really, heshould know better than that).  Murray, and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up gettingtossed.The Mets' fifth started with a Howard Johnson's first-pitch homer.  Pugh must have been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kent'ssingle, then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by Mitchelland turned into a RBI triple. Catcher Hundley's grounder to the drawn-in Bransonfailed to bring Thompson in, then the play of the game occured:Saberhagen was due up, so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infieldto discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze.  They called it perfectly:Thompson was hung out to dry after Pugh's first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended.(Isn't the NATIONAL LEAGUE great??)The Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game.  After Barry Larkin'sground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-backsingles--the third scoring Mitchell.  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a longfly to center.  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, butthird base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself washung out to dry killing the Reds rally.Rob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  With two outs and a runneron second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday gamein late August last year when Bonilla's three-run dinger slapped a loss onDibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci's season.  Bonilla endedup walking, and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a week, and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities.  The win wentto Steve Foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect inningswork, striking out three.  Saberhagen (2-1) got the loss--though I'm a bitsurprised he even pitched in the eighth.  I'll take it, though.The Reds are now 3-9, still the worst team in baseball with the Royals victorytoday.

If the alternative to Morris was letting Cito Gastonsoft-toss the ball underhand to the opposition every 5 days, thenof course the Blue Jays wouldn't have won without Morris.

What happened most of the time is thatMorris fell behind, and the team came back and rescued him.  Mostly,this is because he's a lousy 1st inning pitcher, and much betterthe rest of the way.  That the team can climb out of 4-0, 5-0 holesconsistently and win them 6-5 is not to Morris' credit; it's to theteam's credit.Furthermore, while Morris did exceed the W-L percentage that wouldbe projected from his runs allowed and run support, he hasn't donethis in previous years.  In fact, his W-L record in 1991 is a lotworse than what it projects to be with run support and runs allowed.Do you think he just came up with this ability in 1992.Look at the 2 postseason games he pitched decently in.  TypicalMorris games.  Morris gets behind; team rescues him.  He's notresponsible for that rescue.  And in both those games, the teamjust didn't rescue him enough.  Jack Morris pitched as well as he didduring much of the season in those 2 games; the offense just didn'tearn him a victory.>BTW, I think he should be put in the bullpen; it would be embarrassing a >veteran pitcher which Cito would never do, but his era is 17+, how much more>can he be embarrassed?Morris is one of those guys who will reture when he can't startanymore; he's too bad a first inning pitcher to serve in the bullpen.Greg

I'm sure someone out there in net-land has somefacts about trends in attendance regarding percentage of capacitysold.  But even if the trends are relatively flat, you have to considerwhat is happening on a team-by-team basis.When the TV money dries up, franchises will be seeking to supplant thelost revenues from alternative sources.  One of the best sources maybe ticket sales.Example 1:The DodgersThe Dodgers can count on a strong base of season ticket salesand *probably* believe that they have the ability to raiseprices without hindering revenues.  I certainly think that istrue.Example 2:The PadresThey will be lucky to average 10,000 fans a game this year.If they raise prices, less.  If they want to increase theiroverall revenue base, the best thing they can do is put awinning team on the field.  But given that won't happen (itwon't), they can probably make more money by lowering ticketprices and running frequent promotions.  Will they do that?I have no idea.  But they won't increase prices, because itwon't work *for them*.>2) even assuming that you have some strange power to make the owners>   decrease ticket prices, that does not decrease the tv contract.The only strange powers at work here are the forces of the market place.Each team's market is somewhat different, and each owner is going tobe faced with a unique set of circumstances about how to deal with thosemarket forces.

On September 1 1964 this was thetop of the N.L. standings:                 W     L    GBPhiladelphia    79    51    -Cincinnati      74    57    5 1/2St. Louis       72    59    7 1/2San Francisco   73    60    7 1/2This is a game-by-game description of the remainder of the Phillies'season:Date  Score Opponent        Lead      Pitcher (starting and winner/loser)9/1   4-3   Houston         5 1/2     Bunning (15-4)9/2   2-1   Houston         5 1/2     Short (15-7)9/3   0-6   Houston         5 1/2     Bennett (9-12)9/4   5-3   San Francisco   6 1/2     Mahaffey; Baldschun (6-5)9/5   ??Win San Francisco   6 1/2     Bunning (16-4)9/6   3-4   San Francisco   5 1/2     Short; Baldschun (6-6)9/7   5-1   Los Angeles               Bennett (10-12)      1-3   Los Angeles     6 1/2     Wise (5-3)9/8   2-3   Los Angeles     6         Mahaffey (12-7)9/9 5-10/11 St. Louis       5         Bunning; Baldschun (6-7)            (Cardinals take over 2nd place from Cincinnati)9/10  5-1   St. Louis       6         Short (16-7)9/11  1-0   San Francisco   6         Bennett (11-12)9/12  1-9   San Francisco   6         Mahaffey (12-8)            (Giants move into a tie for 2nd with St. Louis)9/13 4-1/10 San Francisco   6         Bunning (17-4)            (Cardinals back in sole possesion of 2nd place)9/14  4-1   Houston         6 1/2     Short (17-7)9/15  1-0   Houston         6         Bennett (12-12)9/16  5-6   Houston         6         Bunning (17-5)9/17  4-3   Los Angeles     6 1/2     Wise; Schantz (2-4)9/18  3-4   Los Angeles     6         Short; Baldschun (6-8)9/19 3-4/16 Los Angeles     5 1/2     Bennett; Baldschun (6-9)9/20  3-2   Los Angeles     6 1/2     Bunning (18-5)            (Reds move back into tie for 2nd with Cardinals)Well so far so good for the Phillies.

And the final standings were:                 W     L    GBSt. Louis       93    69    -Philadelphia    92    70    1Cincinnati      92    70    1San Francisco   90    72    3Now it doesn't appear to me that Phillies pitchers Bunning and Shortwere really overused, at least by the four-man rotation standard ofthe day, until well along into the 10-game losing streak, at whichtime Mauch was probably desperate for a win at any cost because thePhillies substantial lead had evaporated. The way they were used atthat time may have made the problem worse, although Bunning had oneof his sharpest games of the year in the final day 10-0 shutout ofthe Reds that cost the Reds a share of the pennant. Bunning pitcheda complete game six-hitter, striking out five and walking one. Itwould be inetersting to see, though, how the total innings for theyear for Bunning and Short stacks up against the rest of the league.Also notice that the Phillies played every day from at least September 1through October 1; while they didn't play substantially more games thanthe other teams, the other teams each had a couple days off during thatstretch.-----Eric Smitherics@netcom.comerics@infoserv.comCI$: 70262,3610

You want them to hear you talk like this?Don't you want people who come to this group to talk baseball to thinkyou like to do the same?  Or do you want them to think you're some politically correct demagogue who's oh-so sensitive?  (Ho-hum.)Plus, you're here limiting free speech to "some obscure newsgroup thatI don't read."  What BS.  You got a problem with what Jacobs says, whatKnepper thinks, all you have to do is defeat it with better ideas, moreand better speech.  Yours is the easy way out.As for Knepper: ever notice how sometimes these guys will say just aboutany darn thing that pops in their heads when a mike is shoved in front ofthem?  You know that often the best copy for the news is the one that isn'tpre-prepared.  They know Knepper has controversial ideas about women, theypop some question about Postema.  (An interesting related question would be whether the two ever appeared in the same game.  Off the top of my head,I guess "no."  If my guess is right, Knepper popped off about something thathad nothing to do with him -- and Postema gets a book for it, and he doesn't.)>Now, of course, you don't have to read any of this.>And if you want to cut down on flames, then DON'T POST FLAMEBAIT!>(You don't have to respond to flames, either.

The New York Football Giantshad moved to Yankee Stadium (from the Polo Grounds) in 1958 and washaving problem with stadium management (the City did not own YankeeStadium until 1972).

The Titans were playing in Downing Stadium (where theCosmos played soccer in the 70s).  Because Shea Stadium was tied intothe World's Fair anyway, the city thought it would be a novel idea topromote the new franchise and the World's Fair (like they were doingwith the Mets).

Also the Mets (my other least favorite team) loss to the Rockies made this this a great day and a great start to the weekend as the Cardinals are on the ESPN tonight.Big Lee Smith is having a great start and the Cardinals seem to behitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lotsof hits and not many runs.  Hopefully with the coaches stress onsituational hitting in spring training, the runners LOB will be lowerthis year (probably due to the high strikeout numbers by Jose andLankford and Zeile's off year).I don't know why all the fuss about the Fillies.  The media and all the Filly fans on r.s.b forget who is right behind them in the standings.  Give the Wild Thing a week or two before he starts blowing some games and we'll see who is in first then.  I believe the Cardinal pitching staff is more complete than the Filly staff and that will make thedifference.On a side note, a few years ago (5-6), a comment was made by some baseball player or manager about the Dodger defense.  He was asked where to hit the ball against the Dodgers and he replied "Fair."  I remember it being in the "They Said It" section of Sports Illustrated.I would like to know who said it and what issue it was in.GO REDBIRDS!!Gary Wieman

I thinkbatting practice is interesting, for example, and make a specialeffort to get to the game very early in order to see it.  I think thedelaying tactics of batters, pitchers, catchers, and managers areinteresting because they're attempts to gain advantage through controlof the flow and timing of the game.  Of course, the umpires can, andshould, intervene when these tactics get out of hand.  As Ryan Robbinshas pointed out, there are rules that cover this.One of the more fascinating things about baseball, I think, is itsopen-endedness with regard to time.  You never know if the game is goingto zip right by and be over in less than two hours, or if it's going togo on until four in the morning.  Likewise, some games are action-packed,and some games are slow and lazy.  That's fine by me.  Those folks whowant constant action should watch the games on TV so they can channel-surf and cater to their short attention spans.HeatherHHENDERSON@vax.clarku.edu

Ifso, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. Morrisallows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never inhis career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens' career ERA. ButI forget, in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significanceto Buckner missing that grounder in 1986; had Morris been on the Sox, itwould have been a routine groundout, right?>Whether or not Clemens is better by your standard of measurement>is totally meaningless.

They performed well in two short series and won theWorld Series, and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan, I hope theykeep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when theytraded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical linkbetween Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the manwas credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. Luck runsout, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992,gave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16.Seriously, Roger, I'd really like to hear your explanation of the differencebetween the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris. Which one was a better pitcher,and why? Did Morris somehow "learn how to win" in the intervening ten years?If so, then why did he go 18-12 in 1991 with Minnesota with an ERA over halfa run lower than 1992?

After Vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up themiddle, someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove, hewouldn't have had time to throw Riles out. Yet, the throw beat Rilesby about two steps. I wonder how many others who watched the final outthink Vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand.Does anybody think Vizquel was wrong to field the ball barehanded? Andif he failed to field it cleanly, would it (or should it) have been anerror or a hit? (Judging from Bosio's grimace when the ball bouncedpast him, he must have thought it would go through for a hit.) WhetherVizquel was right or wrong, he certainly made one hell of a play.----------------------------Phil Brown                |aka pb6755@csc.albany.edu |--------------------------

The umpalso overreacted.  Gant was stalking off, but I doubt he wouldhave been gone long.  Hirschbeck should have let him have amoment to compose himself before telling him to come bat.IMHO, umpires should be more flexible than what Hirschbeckshowed.  Gant was disturbed to the point it was pretty likelyhe would not get a hit.A very bad finish to a pretty good game.>-->Dale J.

Three years?  I generally agree withtheir policy of avoiding long-term contracts for pitchers.  But Ithink they enforce it rather too strictly.

If the Jays want to compete for top freeagent pitchers, they will have to accept greater risks.Any idea what the option year deal is for Morris?  Are there anyautomatic activation clauses?

If the leadership effect is there fora starting pitcher, you would expect to see its primary effect on thepitching staff.  You would expect to see the rest of the staff improve.Instead, the rest of the staff declined.You can make a reasonable argument for Winfield providing leadership;the offense picked up considerably from its effectiveness the previousyear.

He stands more erect and very open, with hisleft foot pointing to 3rd base. I'm wondering if this is a recent changein stance for him? Andres had one glaring weakness as a hitter. He couldalways be fooled by a curve ball low and away. If this is indeed a newstance for him, maybe he is not being fooled as easily? As for his patience,Dennis Martinez definitely did not have his good stuff.

After a few down years, the A.L. Eastis back to where it was in the early eighties.  With the emergence of the O'sand the Yanks, it is far and away the best.  While the N.L. West has the bestteam in baseball, and the Reds aren't bad either, they have nothing else.  TheGiants, Astros, and Padres all have talent, they do not have the all arounfteams that are found in the A.L. East.  And the Dodgers just plain suck.  Asfor the Rockies, who knows?   The A.L. East has the defending champs, and although they lost a lot tofree agency, Toronto is still one of the best in baseball.  The Orioles havethe preseason favorite to win the Cy Young in Mike Mussina, and you can neverforget about Ripken.  The signings of Harold Baines and Harold Reynolds don'thurt to much either, although I always liked Bill Ripken.  While they let alot go this summer (Randy Milligan, Joe Orsulak, Bill Ripken, Bob Milacki, SamHorn, Storm Davis, and Craig Lefferts), they kept the heart of their teamintact.My predicted finish:1.

I think it shows alack of class when Tommy, Daryl and the Dodgers blame a single fan forlosing the game.  What about the pitcher who threw up the gopher ball?What about the pitchers that gave up 6 runs up to that point?  Sorry, Tommy.If it were a 2-1 game and Daryl was 5 feet 2 inches tall, then maybe -just maybe - you'd have an argument.

What is the rule that qualifies> a pitcher as making a save?IMHO this is the most untrustworthy, silly stat, by today's rules, in all of baseball.  My understanding is to qualify as a save a pitcher cannot pitch more than three innings and the potential tying run must at least appear in the on-deck circle.  Also, the lead a pitcher enters with cannot excede three runs.I believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in determining winners/savers/etc.  For instance, a pitcher can come in in the ninth with a lead, blow the lead, fall behind, have his team come back in the next half inning and earn the win.  Has this pitcher earned a win, no way.I guy could pitch five strong innings of middle relief and see his teammates rally to tie the score.  Assume he came in to start the fourth and left after the eighth.  His teammate holds the opposition scoreless in the ninth and they score a run in the bottom of the ninth to win.  The third pitcher earns the win and the middle reliever gets no "stat" satisfaction.MikeI bleed the blue of Dodgers and even like Lasorda spaghetti sauce.>

I'd really like to know.  BTW, Sherri, thanks for > the DA data I find it fascinating.Of course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented.Just as a penny saved is a penny earned.  Enough with the cliches.My point is that IF the Braves starters are able to live up totheir potential, they won't need much offensive support.I realize this is a BIG IF.  This staff leaves the '92 BoSox in the dust.There is no legitimate comparison.  Two Cy Young winners, and three otherpitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their firstor second starter.  It seems to me that when quality pitchers take themound, the other teams score less runs.  The team that scores the most runs wins.  This puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage(providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs).  A low scoring game would clearly benefit the Braves.  They should have many low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting.On the flip side, if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players,I would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers.They would have an advantage because they could simply outscore theiropponent.  The name of the games is to win.  Even Ray Knight knows thatyou do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard.All I'm trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitcherslike the Braves have, the offense doesn't need to be as strong.Sam> > -Dave> > >>Sherri Nichols>>snichols@adobe.com >

Sci., Urbana, ILDate: Tue, 20 Apr 1993 23:54:08 GMTLines: 118Disclaimer -- This is for fun.In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called"stolen hits", defined as a play made that "an average fielder would notmake with average effort."  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages postedby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive statsfor the centerfielders. Hits Stolen have been redefined as "Plays JuanGonzalez would not have made."OK, I realize that's unfair.  Juan's probably the victim of pitching staff,fluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If wereplaced every centerfielder in the league with someone with Kevin's 55.4% outmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated NetHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a leagueaverage fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, orDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), whichshould represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don'ttake it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of thisarticle.The short version -- definition of termsHS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt StillwellNHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielderNDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielderNEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielderDCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.DOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution.National LeagueName            HS   NHS   NEB   DCON    DOPSNixon, O.       34    12    15   .083    .777Grissom, M.     48    18    12   .072    .812Jackson, D.     46    13    20   .060    .735Lewis, D.       25     8    -6   .029    .596Dykstra, L.     25     5    -5   .013    .794Dascenzo, D.    10    -5    10   .001    .616Finley, S.      32    -2     2  -.003    .759Lankford, R.    39     4   -12  -.007    .844Martinez, D.    21     5   -16  -.017    .660VanSlyke, A.    30    -4   -17  -.040    .846Sanders, R.      7   -10    -4  -.059    .759Butler, B.       1   -29     5  -.088    .716Johnson, H.      3   -12   -19  -.118    .548Ordered by DOPS.846 VanSlyke.844 Lankford.812 Grissom.794 Dykstra.777 Nixon.759 Finley.759 Sanders.735 Jackson.730 *NL Average*.716 Butler.660 Martinez.616 Dascenzo.596 Lewis.548 JohnsonAmerican League---------------Name            HS   NHS   NEB   DCON    DOPSLofton, K.      57    32    17   .220    .947Wilson, W.      47    26     0   .125    .787White, D.       52    25    28   .119    .812Felix, J.       22     0    32   .063    .713Devereaux, M.   43    16     0   .047    .832McRae, H.       38    11    -1   .038    .631Yount, R.       31     8    -3   .022    .737Kelly, R.       13    -6    -3  -.025    .681Johnson, L.     23    -5   -13  -.040    .641Griffey, K.     15    -9   -12  -.052    .844Puckett, K.     13   -13   -15  -.063    .801Cuyler, M.       6   -10    -6  -.088    .503Gonzalez, J.     0   -21   -15  -.095    .738Order by DOPS.947 Lofton.844 Griffey.832 Devereaux.812 White.801 Puckett.787 Wilson.738 Gonzalez.737 Yount.713 Felix.709 *AL Average*.681 Kelly.641 Johnson.631 McRae.503 CuylerMore discussion --DCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)/AB)Why such a bizzare formula?

(The X-axis being the +/- deviation in clutch hittingvs. non-clutch;  the Y-axis being the number of players.)  Certainlythere would be *some* players on the extreme ends of the bell.  My*supposition* is that if we were to find the SAME players consistently(year after year) at one end of the bell or the other, then we mightbe able to make some reasonable conclusions about *those* players(as opposed to all baseball players).  As a counterexample to >what you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987:>>               Non-Clutch                      Clutch>               AB      H       BA              AB      H       BA> >Maldonado      1060    260     .245            254     78      .307>Lemon          1643    457     .278            256     57      .223>>If you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those "clutch">situations, you'd bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye.  Well, in >1988, Maldonado hit .267 in "non-clutch" and .190 in "clutch", while Lemon>hit .254 in "non-clutch" and .313 in "clutch".  Before you accuse me of >completely cooking the data,You won't hear those kind of accusations from me.  It is interestingthat you selected Maldonado, because he is someone whom I have also looked at.  He has been a very inconsistent hitter (in terms of BA),hitting in 1989 - 92  .217, .273, .250, .272    Admittedly, he hasbeen traded between leagues as well as clubs.  His clutch hitting record is equally inconsistent.  So, for my purposes in 1993 I wouldnot draw any conclusions about his ability to hit in the clutch basedon his prior performance.  I don't know how I would have felt in 1988,but you may indeed be right.  When I looked at Sabo I found a more consistent record of hitting, anda more consistent pattern of his clutch hitting being proportionatelybelow his non-clutch BA.  Ditto for Joe Carter.This probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am havingwith others on this topic.  Must any conclusion based on statisticalhistory be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base beforeit has any validity?  Is it impossible (or irrational) to applystatistical analysis to selected components of the data base?>BTW, correlating players' _overall_ batting average from '84-'87 with>'88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant at>something better than the 99.9% confidence level.

He is onlyinsurance in case of extra innings or the 2nd catcheris injured during a game.     So to free up this rosterspot for an extra pinch hitter or reliever, why notinvoke a catcher re-substitution rule:If the last roster catcher on a team isinjured during a game, the team is permittedto substitute in his place for defensive purposesa catcher who has previously been yanked fromthe game.

He alsoplayed for the first three seasons of the NL, hitting .329.----------------------------Phil Brown                |aka pb6755@csc.albany.edu |--------------------------
