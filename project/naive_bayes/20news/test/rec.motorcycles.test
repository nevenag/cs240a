Firstly, motorcycles do not steerthemselves - only the rider can do that. Secondly, it is the adhesion of thetyre on the road, the suspension geometry  and the ground clearance of the motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles, andnot the knowledge of physics between the rider's ears. Are you seriouslysuggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner fasteror more competentlY than you could manage otherwise??>Mike, I'm extremely gratified for you that you have such a natural>affinity and prowess for motorcycling that formal training was a total>waste of time for you (assuming your total "training" hasn't come from>simply from reading rec.motorcycles).  However, 90%+ of the motorcyclists>I've discussed formal rider education with have regarded the experience>as overwhelmingly positive.  This regardless of the amount of experience>they brought into the course (ranging from 10 minutes to 10+ years).Formal training in this country (as far as I am aware) does not includecountersteering theory.  I found out about countersteering about six years ago,from a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist. I didn't believe himat first when he said I steered my bike to the right to make it turn left,but I went out and analysed closely what I was doing, and realized he was right! It's an interesting bit of knowledge, and I've had a lot of fun sincethen telling others about it, who were at first as sceptical as I was. Butthat's all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge, and to claim thatit is essential for all bikers to know it, or that you can corner fasteror better as a result, is absurd.Formal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going tobe able to ride a bike properly and safely. But by including countersteeringtheory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily, right atthe time when there are *far* more important matters for them to learn.And that was my original point.Mike

While I was waiting my turn to state my case andplea of why I was going 75 in a 55 in my cage, I had the opportunityto listen to some of the "creative excuses" offered the judge by others.After listening to a number of "Well, I was passing a very slow truckthat suddenly speed up" versions, I decided that the judge had heardjust about every story in the book and then some.  He was less thanimpressed with any of them.This young, rather burley looking guy, had his docket read by arather drill sargent looking Ohio State Highyway Patrol Trooper.He was clocked riding a motorcycle at a speed of 110 mph in a 55 mphzone.  It was also noted that the defendant (motorcycle rider) hadalcohol on his breath, but was not cited for this offence.The judge looked over his half glasses purched on the end of his noseand said in his sternest voice: "Well son, those are some prettyfast speeds to be riding a motorcycle.  What do you have to say foryour self?""Well Sir", meekly the defenant replied, "I just was over to mybuddys and we had a couple of beers and I was on my way home."He offered nothing more or less.  Just had a couple of beers andwas doing 110 mph on his way home.The judge moved by the simplicity of the response, fined him themaximum in this case (plus court costs of course) and ordered himto attend remedial drivers training school.Isn't America Great??--------------------------------------------------------------------Bill Mohrman                                         81-CB900CMotorola , SPSColumbus, OH------------------- Disclaimers Apply ------------------------------

They usuallyonly take a few days for the whole thing, and you do not have to preparethe bike in any way (other than draining the gas).  Not to mention thatit is about 25% of the normal shipping costs (by the time you crate a bikeand ship it with another company, you can pay around $1000)________________________________________________________________________Nick Coburn                     DoD#6425                      AMA#679817                  '88CBR1000              '89CBR600                       coburnn@spot.colorado.edu________________________________________________________________________

I'm not suggesting that you should alwaysaim to brake as hard as you possibly can - but if you want to find thelimits of the machine, you have to go beyond them. In any case, for maximum braking, if (as I suggested) you aim to keepboth wheels just on the point of sliding, then you'll be doingexactly as *you* suggest!!

Hard braking and swerving tend to be mutually exclusive> manouvres - did Hurt draw any conclusions on which one is generally preferable?Apparently the instinct to brake in the face of danger isn't as strong as the instinct to freeze up and do nothing in the face of danger.  Hurtfound that a surprising number of accident-involved motorcyclists hadn'tused their brakes at all prior to impact.  I think the only way you'll ever use countersteering reliably and correctly in a crisis is to make it the only conscious method of directional control youever use, and to practice it constantly, even when you have no need to doany turning.  If you follow me down a long straight, and I seem to be wiggling back and forth randomly or suddenly without obvious need, it's becauseI'm practicing countersteering and avoiding imaginary obstacles directly inmy path.  All of this practice may indeed be futile, but if I have evenmilliseconds to react, the most *familiar* tactic available (and hopefully the most automatic) will be countersteering.  The same logic applies to brakingwith the front brake, of course.Chuck Rogerscar377@torreys.att.com

Are there traditional1) If the Ninja has adjustable suspension, adjust it to a stiffersetting so you don't bottom out in bumpy curves.2) Tell her the 3 cardinal rules are:a) NEVER EVER EVER EVER put her feet down. Not when you stop at a STOPsign, not when she thinks you're gonna crash, never. Keep them on thepegs until you tell her to get off the bike.b) She is to hold onto your waist. She should hold on tightly enoughthat she won't slide off the bike if you twist the throttle a bit. And(added bonus for you here), she should keep as close to your butt aspossible so quick stops don't make her slide into you and knock yourballs up onto the gas tank. You decide how best to word this.c) Just stay perpendicular to the bike; straight up in the seat. Don'tlean your body into curves, just go with the bike and stay perpendicular.Don't look over your shoulder.*3) Remember at all times that you have a passenger on the back. Thatmeans don't pop the clutch, and try to corner and stop smoother thanusual. Be aware that if you jump on the brake, you're going to havethe equivalent of a 100 lb. dead weight crashing into you from behind,so be prepared for that.4) Make sure she pisses before the ride even if she says she doesn'thave to go. No anti-women stuff here; I have a tiny bladder myself.5) Remind her to look around while you're riding. Point to thingsof interest. It makes the ride more enjoyable to her (she won't getso focused on just looking at the back of your helmet), and it givesher ample excuse to squeeze you to show she saw what you pointed at.* My wife and I tried the MSF-recommended "look over the rider'sshoulder in curves" bit, and it just didn't work. The timing ofher weight shift was unpredictable (especially on the Maxim because,unlike the Ninja, the upright riding position really restricts thepillion's view of the road ahead). Next time I had her just remainperpendicular to the bike, and I could hardly tell there was someoneelse on the bike in curves, and she weighs substantially over 100 lbs.-- Curtis Jackson   cjackson@mv.us.adobe.com'91 Hawk GT'81 Maxim 650DoD#0721 KotB  '91 Black Lab mix "Studley Doright"  '92 Collie/Golden "George""There is no justification for taking away individuals' freedom in the guise of public safety." -- Thomas Jefferson

As recommended, I had the bike compression tested.  Compression wasa little low, but very even across the four cylinders (+/- 5 psi).  Theysaid that it was tested a little cold, so that would explain the low numbers (around 90).  Does this sound right?  Otherwise, the bike lookedgreat.  No signs of road rash, and no rust.  This bike looks great! It is now in the shop getting tuned and new tires.  I am opting for the Metzler ME55 and ME33 tires (thanks to those who posted this other thread).  This bike is _BIG_ compared to my other bikes.  ( Sure is alot harder to load on a trailer than the KDX200 was. )  I shouldbe road legal tomorrow.

Suggestions?Glad to hear that the bozo managed to stop.  I've only been riding forabout two years, but here are my rules for traffic light survival:     - I try to *never* stop just over a hill behind a car.  If I have       to stop in such a location, I pull almost completely next to the       car in front of me.  If I'm the only one (ie no car in front), I       turn the bike somewhat sideways across the lane, to increase my       visibility to any oncoming vehicle.  Make sure to keep your       taillight visible to traffic, though. (NOTE:  My bike is bright       white; turning sideways on a black bike might not be as beneficial.)     - On a flat road, I stop with a bit of room ahead of me (usually       about two or three bike lengths).  This will (hopefully) give       me room to pull forward and to the side as a car approaches.     - If you are the last in a line of vehicles, watch your mirrors       *constantly!*  If you see a vehicle approaching, and can't see       any evidence to indicate that he/she is slowing down, get out       of the way *now!*     - Flicker your brake light.  If I'm the last vehicle in line, I       will pull and release the brake as a car approaches from       behind (noticed the car by watching my mirrors, of course :-).       I vary the speed of the flicker, hoping to make the cager notice       that there's something in the lane ahead of him.Now, with all that said, it's the situation where you are first in linethat I feel most defenseless.  If you're first in line, your forward escaperoute is seriously limited - you can only move forward to the extent thatyou don't enter the intersection.  I leave some room behind the stop line(although around here, the #@$*! light activators are always right up next to the stop line!), and watch the mirrors.  I *think* I've decidedthat hopping off the bike might be the best way out of this situation.Any other ideas for being first in line with no traffic directly behindyou?-rob.--Rob Griffiths  | Erasure.ShonaLaing.WildSwans.B52s.U2.JudyBats.REM.Smithsrobg@apple.com |  FAA Certified cloud basher  I wanna drive the Zamboni!

I pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage. My bike is a Kawasaki GPX250R with footpegs that are hinged and sprung suchthat they fold upward and backward on contact with ground etc., and on thelower extreme corner of each peg there is mounted a "bank-follower", or alittle stud that theoretically is the first bit to hit the ground in a100%-banked turn.  The stud is mounted on the footpeg by a threaded bit about 7mm long, which screws into a threaded hole in the footpeg.  Now for themystery.The stud on the side of the bike that clunked when I turned was absent.  I'mfairly sure it was there before the event.  There was no damage to the end ofthe footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have been.  In fact, the thread inthe hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact, with no evidence of somethinghaving been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously.  Okay all you engineering types, how the f**k do you explain this ?  How can yourip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole (in alloy) withoutdamaging the thread in the hole ?  Is this some sort of hi-tech design thingothat Kawasaki never mentioned, like that the end of the footpeg suddenlychanges phase on impact, to let the stud rip out, then changes back to a solid?  I'm quite amazed at how this could have happened.  In the meantime, lifegoes on, without a left-hand bank-follower.Barry Manor DoD# 620 confused accidental peg-scraper

If it's a choicebetween injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there isonly one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would putthe dog first.Second, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you reactto a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you'replaying with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog whichhas hostile intent.Third, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are socialbeasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there aretwo types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that whichdominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of thelatter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible.But God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and mayeven on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy ohrapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!Now, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea toassume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's agame, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one;when you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place ofinterception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle sothat when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds toreact to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that amotorcycle is capable of.With a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measuresmay be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important-- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on theroad, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled upnewspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that willhurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude isthat you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  Thelarger the dog, the greater your anger.Dogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and heare not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps heis on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.Most dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territorywhere there is at least a home advantage.

No, notthe usual Grip Of Death technique, I adjusted the closed Vice-Grips sothey were snug on the zipper jaws, then released them and tightened theadjusting screw a bit.

Finally,the 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up, became warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, Itook a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride.They had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hoursbefore I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom --surrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.Today was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes,50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly FatTouring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot.Some sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running oneMSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one onthe back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food thatCycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed likea big moto party.After about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime,and another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/pray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in theparking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from the Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything elseinto the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the ST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge ofthe road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like abicycle!  'It cant be that heavy' I thought.Well I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could think was "big".  Then I put one foot up.  "Heavy" came to mind veryquickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to tell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemednearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.By 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Evenon bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that did not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! ison a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles northof the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95splits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited accesshighway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton, Manchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester.On its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through manythoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.Cindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring alongin top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane changes were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this thing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind thefairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting wasnon-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless.Smooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of,but it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endlessbuzz.The jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with thebrakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius,decreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.  The section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works okin this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shackoft featured in "Spencer for Hire" -- a place where you could really find "Spencer", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After puttingthrough traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.About half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy's wrist, our singalfor "hold on tight".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Secondgear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a short shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very lighttraffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new.Well, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effortlane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayedthere.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering, I looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.Beverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the "getoff in a mile" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wantedto re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there wereseveral manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the slow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could see even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managedto thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete padout front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to putthe thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the sidestand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.My demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable,hardly notices the DoD speed.   I'd buy on for about $3000 less than list, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is.--  Frank Evan Perdicaro Xyvision Color Systems      Legalize guns, drugs and cash...today.101 Edgewater Drive   inhouse: frank@marvin, x5572Wakefield MAouthouse: frank@contex.com, 617-245-4100x5572018801285

What you want are Meguiar's Mirror Glaze Plastic Polish and PlasticCleaner. They are very mild abrasives meant to remove scratches fromplastic. For fine scratches just use the Polish, for bigger ones startwith the Cleaner and finish with the Polish. The stuff is $5-8 bucks perbottle at most auto or motorcycle parts stores.

The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when(forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing.The first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to MaxFriz's famous design, but with an overhead "point cam" (see below formore on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no groundclearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, sothat the ground clearance was substantially increased:      ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)                 Viking motor (front) ->   \\=@=/This is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curvedaround a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turnin the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connectingrods to accomodate the stroke.The engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and stillunique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing andand extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe wasrequired to drive both overhead valves.Just as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used apressurized stream of oil to power the "waterwheel" which kept the lobespinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutalengineering fixes was that until the engine's oil pressure came up tonormal, the engine's valve timing would be more or less random,resulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was alittle hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started thebeast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches topressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,uses an electric oil pump. Wimps).Despite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosivelyfiring its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarilylose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run evenhigher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. Thiswas feasible because it was a racing engine.With just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towersbecause of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to analmost perfect point:                    /\\                   /()\\   <-lobe                  / XX \\  <-complex linkage (not shown due to valvestems ->   / \\  / \\    complexity)                |  |   | |                |  |===| |                    =0=  <---piston                     |                             Note that the tip was not truly vertical                             (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the                             ground, and this drawing doesn't show the                             curvature because there was none in the                             head itself. The bore curve would start                             about where the cylinder bore disappears in                             this diagramThe effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits ofthe day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair offinned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. Thus, thename.The Vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when itworked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionarytechnology. Eventually, it was dumped when Spag finally realized thatracing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made. The machineswere raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate(approximately six Vikings were made, plus one or possibly twoSpringers. Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up anddown that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many astwenty or thirty machines may have come off the line. However, no modernrecord of a production Viking has survived, and most motorcyclehistorians discount this story.Ryan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to RideKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work toDoD# 0863      |I'd be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame toryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . . * SLMR 2.1a * If you aren't sliding, you aren't riding.                                                                                                          ----+===============================================================+|COMPUTER DYNAMICS BBS    604-255-9937(HST)    604-986-9937(V32)||Vancouver, BC, Canada -  Easy Access, Low Rates, Friendly Sysop|+===============================================================+

A couple of years I was involved in a low-speedgetoff in which I landed on my back on the pavement.  My head (helmeted)hit the pavement with a "clunk", leaving a couple of dings and chips in thepaint at the point of impact, but no other visible damage.  I called thehelmet manufacturer and inquired about damage.  They said that the way afiberglass shell works is to first give, then delaminate, then crack.This is the way fiberglass serves to spread the force of the impact over awider area.  After the fiberglass has done its thing, the crushable foamliner takes care of absorbing (hopefully) the remaining impact force.They told me that the second stage of fiberglass functionality (delaminationof the glass/resin layers) can occur with NO visible signs, either inside oroutside of the helmet.  They suggested that I send them the helmet and theywould inspect it (including X-raying).  I did so.  They sent back the helmetwith a letter stating that that they could find no damage that wouldcompromise the ability of the helmet to provide maximum protection.(I suspect that this letter would eliminate their being able to claimprior damage to the helmet in the event I were to sue them.)The bottom line, though, is that it appears that a helmets integritycan be compromised with no visible signs.  The only way to know for sureis to send it back and have it inspected.  Note that some helmetmanufacturers provide inspections services and some do not.

Personally, I think it's your Duty As a Citizento make it as much trouble as possible for them, so maybe they'll Give Upand Leave Us Alone Someday Soon.  The cop was certainly within his legal rights to nail you by guessingyour speed.  Mr. Brown (the author of Fight Your Ticket) mentions anOakland judge who convicted a speeder "on the officer's testimony thatthe driver's car sounded like it was being driven at an excessive speed."  You can pay off the State and your insurance company, or you cantake it to court and be creative.  Personally, I've never won that wayor seen anyone win, but the judge always listens politely.  And I haven'tseen _that_ many attempts.  You could try the argument that since bikes are shorter than thecars whose speed the nice officer is accustomed to guessing, they thereforeappear to be further away, and so their speed appears to be greater thanit actually is.  I left out a step or two, but you get the idea.  If youcan make it convincing, theoretically you're supposed to win.  I've never tried proving the cop was mistaken.  I did get to seesome other poor biker try it.  He was mixing up various facts likethe maximum acceleration of a (cop) car, and the distance at whichthe cop had been pacing him, and end up demonstrating that he couldn'tpossibly have been going as fast as the cop had suggested.  He'dbrought diagrams and a calculator.  He was Prepared.  He lost.  Keepin mind cops do this all the time, and their word is better than yours.Maybe, though, they don't guess how fast bikes are going all the time.Besides, this guy didn't speak English very well, and ended up absolutelyconfounding the judge, the cop, and everyone else in the room who'd beenrecently criminalized by some twit with a gun and a quota.  Ahem.  OK, I'm better now.  Maybe he'd have won had his presentationbeen more polished.  Maybe not.  He did get applause.

But just as the cop was about to stepout of the car, the dude punches it down an interstate in Georgia.Ang then, the cop gives chase.Now this was an interesting episode because it was all videotaped!!!Everything from the dramatic takeoff and 135mph chase to the sidestreetbattle at about 100mph.  What happened at the end?  The guy (who isbeing relentless chased down box the cage with the disco lights)slows a couple of times to taunt the cop.   After blowing a few stopsigns and making car jump to the side, he goes up a dead end street.The Kat, although not the latest machine, is still a high performancemachine and he slams on the brakes.  Of couse, we all know that cages,especially the ones with the disco lights, can't stop as fast as ourhigh performance machines.  So what happens?...  The cage plows into theKat.Luckily for this dude, he was wearing a helmet and was not hurt.  Butdude, how crazy can you get!?!  Yeah, we've all went out and playedcat and mouse with our friends but, with a cop!!???!!!  How crazy canyou get!?!?!  It took just one look at a ZX-7 who tried this crapto convince me not to try any shit like that.  (Although the dudecollided with a car head on at 140 mph, the Kawasaki team colorsstill looked good!!!  Just a few scratches, like no front end....3 inch long engine and other "minor" scratches...)If you guys are out there, please, slow it down.  I not beingan advocate for the cages (especially the ones that make that annoying ass noises...), but just think...

This is  a very good dirt bike and has been maintained perfectly.  I never had  any problems with it.  It's a four stroke, 4 valves, liquid cooled engine. It is heavier than   a 250 2 stroke but still lighter than a Honda XR600 and has a lot better   suspension (Ohlins shock, Husky fork) than the XR. For the casual or non  competitive rider, the engine is much better than any two stroke.  You can easily lug up hills and blast through trails with minimum gear  changes.    The 1992 ignition and the carefully tuned carburation makes this bike  very easy to start (starts of first kick when cold or hot).  There is a  custom made carbon/kevlar (light 1 pound) wrap around skid plate to protect  the engine cases and the water pump.  The steering angle has been reduced   by 2 degree to increase steering quickness. This with the suspension tune-up  by Phil Douglas of Aftershock (Multiple time ISDE rider) gives it a better  ride than most bike: plush suspension, responsive steering with no head shake.  So if it is such a good bike why sell it???? Gee, I want to buy a Husaberg,  which just a husky but 25 pounds lighter... and a tad more $$$.

Even a normal upshift causes yourpassenger to bob, so I ease off the throttle before pulling in theclutch to eliminate this.  It's more work, but your passenger willappreciate it!  Also, I've found that using more rear brake than normalhelps keep the bike from diving as much during routine stops, whichmakes it much easier for the passenger to hang on.

The point of formal training must be to prepare riders for the road. Preparedness is in my opinionto know as much as possible. So, to exclude some aspects of riding a bike in a course is wrong IMHO. Now to countersteering in particular.Countersteering is something that must be trained. A common reaction among new bikers (or bicycle riders) in an emergency situation, is to steer the motorcycle like a bicycle. As we know this makes the motorcycle go in thedirection opposite to what was intended. Needless to say, this is dangerous.I have a specific example: A rider in a left turn. The rider thinks he/sheis to close to the right shoulder of the road, and tries to steer the motorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right handle. The motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road. A worse scenario: The same rider, same turn. In the middle of the turnthe rider sees a truck coming towards him/her. The panicking rider triesto steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it.The main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency situations, AND what to do if in one. Thus, the knowledge (and training) ofcountersteering is IMHO a must in any riding course.-- staal@idt.unit.no

Note I did not say stupid, just ignorant.(They might be stupid, but then so are some high percentageof any group).White trash: "White trash fit the stereotype referred to by theword 'nigger' better than any black person I ever met, onlywith the added 'bonus' that white trash are mean as hell."-- my father.

Whereas thatmay be sufficient to get you down the road under normal circumstances,possibly for years at a stretch, I can't think of anybody who'd arguethat this is preferable to properly knowing how to manipulate the barin a turn, regardless of what you want to call it.Except maybe for Mr. Sixsmith...  ;^)Mr. Bill-- + Bill Leavitt, #224 +   '82 CBX "White Lightning", '82 GS850G "Suzibago"   ++ leavitt@cs.umd.edu + '76 CJ360 "Little Honda", '68 Lone Star "Sick Leave" ++  DoD AMA ICOA NIA  + '69 Impala convertible "The Incredible Hulk", others ++ "Hmmm, I thought bore and stroke *was* the technique!"

Vibration? BMW's don't vibrate. Everyone knows that.I'd agree with Henry.  The grips are really nice to have in winter,and aren't noticably different from 'normal' grips in summer.  My only complaint is that the 'low' setting might as well be 'off'.This has been complained about by every reviewer, official andunofficial, that's ever talked about these grips.  The 'high' settingis often too high for use with lightweight summer gloves when thingsjust get a bit nippy, but since 'low' doesn't produce a noticableeffect, I end up turning the grips on and off to keep the temperatureabout right.  This generally isn't a problem when wearing thickerwinter gloves.  When I asked the dealer if they could fix it, Ireceived a consoling pat on the back, and their sincere apologies forthe poor design (actually, I was told they worked just like they weresuppose to).Vibration?

Completely smooth.  Not that it runs poorly normally, buton these days, it is exceptional.  My theory is that the air densityand moisture content of the air are such that I get completecombustion.  Needless to say, it puts me in a great mood.The mood lasted for about 20 miles.  Heading north on the 405freeway, about a mile or two south of the 10, my throttle stoppedresponding.... and I was between lanes.  Nothing to do but make my way over 4 lanes to the shoulder... initially by gliding, thenby pushing.  At least traffic was heavy enough so that cars didnot mind stopping for me.Turned out to be a screw unscrewed inside my Mikuni HS40 carb.  I keep hearing that one should keep all of the screwstight on a bike, but I never thought that I had to do thaton the screws inside of a carb.  At least it was roadsidefixable and I was on my way in hardly any time.____________________________________________________________________________   Death is life's way of telling you you've been fired  -- R.

Lets beginby saying that its whole rear end was definately Hawk 650.  Additionally,it had a CBR900RR style tank, full fairing, and only a tach.  Now, atfirst I thought it was an 'RC31' (a Hawk modified by Two Brothers Racing),but I did not think that they made this huge tank for it.  Additionally,the gauges were certainly not from a Hawk.  They looked much more like 900RR gauges.  Overall, the bike looked like a 900RR except for therear single-sided swingarm and wheel (there were straight from the Hawk)So, what did I see?(PS, for any of you Boulder DoDers, I saw it parked at the Engineeringcenter today. It is white with light green stripes.)________________________________________________________________________Nick Coburn                     DoD#6425                      AMA#679817                  '88CBR1000              '89CBR600                       coburnn@spot.colorado.edu________________________________________________________________________

It sounded like a nice way to add nighttime visibility without turning the bike into a carnival attraction.I talked to the local BMW dealer about this.  I was told that the only thing he had heard about this kind of reflector, was it being used in a coming line of BMW clothing (rainsuits).

I'm looking for  recommendations for a suitable replacement.  I wouldlike to buy a full Aerostich suit but I can't afford $700 for it right now.I'm considering two basic options:1)  Buy the Aerostich jacket only.  Dunno how much it costs    due to recent price increases, but I'd imagine over $400.    That may be pushing my limit.  Advantages include the fact    that I can later add the pants, and that it nearly eliminates    the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit.2)  Buy some kind of leather jacket.  I like a few of the new     Hein-Gericke FirstGear line, however they may be a bit pricey    unless I can work some sort of deal.  Advantages of leather    are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose    value (we all know how important that is :-), possibly cheaper    than upper Aerostich.Requirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other layers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i'd prefer a zip-out lining, it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows, shoulders, forearms, possibly back/kidney protection, etc.), a reasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would be a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (belowfreezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.Please fire away with suggestions, comments, etc...Steve----  Steve Andersen  DoD #0239                               andersen@me.udel.edu (302) 832-0136                                     andersen@zr1.ccm.udel.edu 1992 Ducati 907 I.E.                                      1987 Yamaha SRX250 "Life is simply a consequence of the complexities of carbon chemistry..."

I'm new to motorcycles so no flames please.  I don'thave my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information:1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too ignorant to know I need to buy)2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance uptill now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makesa difference)3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?4)  In DC, as I imagine it is in every other state (OK, OK, we're not a state - we're not bitter ;)), you take the written test first and thenget a learners permit.  However, I'm wondering how one goes about learning to ride the bike proficiently enough so as to a) get a liscenceand b) not kill oneself.  I don't know anyone with a bike who could teach me, and the most advice I've heard is either "do you live near afield" or "do you have a friend with a pickup truck", the answers to bothof which are NO.  Do I just ride around my neighborhood and hope for the best?  I kind of live in a residential area but it's not suburbs.It's still the big city and I'm about a mile from downtown so that doesn't seem too viable.  Any stories on how you all learned?Thanks for any replies in advance.-Greg Humphreys:wq^^^Meant to do that.  (Damn autoindent)--Greg Humphreys               |  "This must be Thursday.

If the towns-people aren't ruffled by the"indiscretions" and the partyers aren't either, maybe the "indiscretions"don't amount to anything more threatening or damaging than harmless good-natured rowdiness among consenting adults.  The only thing that really bothered me about the description was the knee-deep empty beer cans in the street, but maybe the town had a plan to deal with that since they helped set up the party in the first place.  If I lived there and thebikers' previous visits had established a record of mutual cooperationand good intentions, I'd certainly rather they stick around and partythan go riding off into the night impaired and maybe get hurt or killed.> Oh-- I'm sorry, I just noticed that you left mucho bucks (as in MONEY)...> Nevermind my criticism, I was out of line.

I really would like some advice on what would;be a good starter bike for me.  I do know one thing however, I need to;make my first bike a good one, because buying a second any time soon is;out of the question.  I am specifically interested in racing bikes, (CBR;600 F2, GSX-R 750).  I know that this may sound kind of crazy;considering that I've never had a bike before, but I am responsible, a;fast learner, and in love.  Responsible and in love?  I believe that's a contradictionin terms.Unless you're really brave (read: "reckless") a 500cc sportbike will go way faster than you dare for at least your firstyear of riding.  Getting more than that really is overkill,as you'll never even want to use it.  The following bikescan be bought (and repaired!) cheaply, are easy for a noviceto manage, and are plenty high performance:    Kawasaki EX-500    Honda VF-500 "Interceptor"    Suzuki GS-550EThe 0-100mph time of the EX-500 at full throttle is "waysooner than you're ready for it".  :-)  With somethingas small as a 250, you'd probably be wishing for morepower pretty quickly (unless it's a TZR or RGV :).Now, I'm not saying that you're 100% certain to killyourself immediately with a 600f2 or a GSXR-750.  Plentyof people have started riding on those bikes and donejust fine.  What I am saying is that it's a waste ofmoney, and a waste of perfectly good plastic when youdrop the thing learning how to balance while stopping.You'll never get the throttle more than half openanyway, so why spend the extra 2000 bucks?---chris

I bought one of the last two theyever made.Finding decent womens motorcycling gear is not easy.  There is a lotof stuff out there that's fringed everywhere, made of fashion leather,made to fit men, etc.  I don't know of a shop in your area.  Thereare some women rider friendly places in the San Francisco/San Josearea, but I don't recommend buying clothing mail order.  Too hardto tell if it'll fit.  Bates custom makes leathers.  You might wantto call them (they're in L.A.) and get a cost estimate for the typeof jacket your wife is interested in.  Large manufacturers likeBMW and H.G. sell women's lines of clothing of decent quality, butfit is iffy.A while ago, Noemi and Lisa Sieverts were talking about startinga business doing just this sort of thing.

Just keep an eye out for the blue GLH Turbo that utilizes the "hit-the-ground-running" merging technique. At least I don't have a dog that you need worry about.Last week while entering a sand/gravel covered intersection in the country, I caught something unkosher out of the corner of my eye (you know that disgusting sensation when great, as-of-yet unidentified, evil is about to intimately acquaint itself with you-- kind of like knowing that that darkening shadow around you just cannot possibly be anything even remotely good, becauseit probably has something to do with a Boeing 747 behaving, gravitationallyspeaking, much like a brick).  Negotiating my way into this intersection that somehow reminded me of Daytona beach (sans H2O, sun, & babes) I manage to get aglance at my impending destiny.  Lucifer's own DOG.  Hell's secret blendof canine-- Doberman and Rottweiler (it moved with the grace of a Doberman,yet had the hulk and jowels of the Rottweiler-- a creature with a definite*wrong* end to be at).  The picture in my mirrors was fuzzy, but there was no mistaking the fangs and saliva trail.  To shorten a verbose tale, my burly gaurdian-angels once again performed aboveand beyond the call of duty, carried the bike through the sand-trap (I honestlyhave no idea how), and left the minion of Beelzebub with a face that suspiciously resembles a Metzler tread.  No blood, though-- Rats.Moral: I'm not really sure, but more and more I believe that bikers ought        to be allowed to carry handguns.-Erc._______________________________________________________________________________C Eric SundheimGrandRapids, MI, USA`90 Hondo VFR750fDoD# 1138-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assuming that the helmet/head assembly takes the same impact, if the shell cracks in one case, then inthe other the liner must be dented, or the head gets jiggled. If it's thethe liner that's dented, the helmet is just as toast as if the shell werecracked, it won't absorb energy form an impact in that area.

The crappiest drivers make out like banditsbecause they no longer have to bear the responsibility of paying forinsurance that they have boosted in price for themselves by being crappydrivers.  The good drivers now pay through the nose to spread the cost ofthe crappy drivers' actions, and that's not fair.Any plan that caps rates for crappy drivers is inherently a piece ofshit, because the rest of us end up paying more.Any plan that uses speeding tickets as a basis for raising rates isalso a piece of shit as it is based upon the lie that faster drivers areinherently less safe than slower drivers, and the NHTSA disproved that twoyears ago now.Later,-- Chris BeHannaDoD# 114          1983 H-D FXWG Wide Glide - Jubilee's Red Ladybehanna@syl.nj.nec.com          1975 CB360T - Baby BikeDisclaimer:  Now why would NEC  1991 ZX-11 - needs a nameagree with any of this anyway?

Ihave taken those lessons to heart.  Over the past year I have had only a few near collisions with traffic morons on four wheels.  Yesterday I got to addanother to the list but with this one I felt the most helpless.  I am sittingat a light about 1 - 2 car lengths behind a car, a wise decsion.  Suddenly I hear screeching tires.  I dart my eyes to my mirrors and realize it's the moroon flying up right behind me, in my panic I pop my clutch and stall thebike.  Luckily the guy stops a foot behind my rear wheel.I understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can youreally in actuality avoid such an incident?  Suggestions?

It can be hardto learn if you aren't paying atttention to the differences between successand failure.  Especially if you get really pissed off and flatten thebattery while trying to get it to run.If my bike has been sitting for a few weeks, I give it a short while tostart.

This is from board memberRobert Higdon to MOA Pres Chich Morse.  This is NOT my words, O.K. guys?                                   April 4, 1993re:  Cecil King's Nominating Statement Dear Chick:      We have a very serious problem with the election for president of the MOA this year.  Cecil King's nominating statement (as it appeared in theOwners News) is 968 words, nearly twice as many as that is permitted bythe by-laws.  In pertinent part, the rules state:"Each candidate's biography and position statement shall be limited toa combined total of no more than 500 words. The nominating committe shall cut afafter the 500th word any biography and position statement exceeding this length.    Obviously the nominationg committe was not up to the task.  Had Cecil'sstatement been cut as required, it would have concluded approximately withthe word "undertiding" [sic] in the second paragraph after the commencementof his Position Statement.  As a result, Cecil has obtained what I view as agrossly unfair advantage over the other candidates for president.  This doesnot just taint the election for that office; it makes a mockery of the process.  I would appreciate your advising the board immediately what stepsyou intend to take to rectify this caricature of a fair election.     Parenthetically, in your private correspondence with others, I wouldbe most appreciative that when tou call me an "asshole" you remind theletter's recipient that the re-publication of such a comment is almostguaranteed to have woeful consequences.   With kind regards, I remain,                                 Robert HigdonO.K. MOA'ers, You read it, think for yourself, I trust you do know whoCecil King is, and that he was Editor befor Don Douglass, and he isa pres. candidate.

If your|primary concern is complying with stupid helmet laws, carry a real big|spare (you can put a big or small head in a big helmet, but not in a|small one).  Well, you can accomplish both goals, actually, if you have a definitephysical type in mind when you go to these (cough) church meetings..  Ifyour tastes tend to smaller, more petite (cough) churchgoers, it is morelikely that they will have a smaller head, and you can safely get a mediumor small helmet.  This works for me, and I traded my spare large helmet with my best friend,who, at 6'9", tends to look more for women that are over 6'0", and can'tusually fit into the medium size helmet he previously had...  Of course, if you aren't picky what size (*cough*) churchgoers you givehelpful motorcycle rides to, then Ed's advice will hopefully cover anyeventuality as far as legality is concerned, and a spare handtowel in thetankbag makes acceptable padding so the passenger can see out of the viewport(rather than the padding above the viewport) in the cases of extreme mismatch.Randy Davis                            Email: randy@megatek.comZX-11 #00072 Pilot                            {uunet!ucsd}!megatek!randyDoD #0013       "But, this one goes to *eleven*..." - Nigel Tufnel, _Spinal Tap_

If that's the "official line" taught in those rider education classesyou were refering to, that also don't teach countersteering, I have toquestion the quality of the classes.  The "official line" in MSFcurricula is as I described.  Maximum braking is achieved by applyingboth brakes equally, when the weight distribution is nominally even andboth tires have equal normal forces, and easing off on the rear toprevent locking it, and increasing braking on the front, as moretraction is available to the front due to increased normal force due toweight shift.The "official line" you have been taught seems ineffective on the faceof it.  Applying the rear brake after the front is not taking advantageof all the traction available to the rear at time 0, and is halving theavailable braking power by using only the front at time 0.>>Saying, "brake until the tire just begins to slide" is next to useless>>advice to a newbie.

"Chirping" the tire indicates impending lockup(on most surfaces), and serves as a good guide to newbies to indicatemaximum braking.

I'll tell you what we've found and the systems we've worked out.- On starts, accelerate MUCH slower than usual.  It's tough for the riderto judge how scary fast acceleration is, because we're holding onto somethingand leaning forward.  Remember this.- On turns, have her lean forward and at the same angle as you (normally this means she isn't leaning at all.)  It's very disconcerting to be leanedover and have your passenger leaning so that they're sitting straight up.Much balance is lost and this can be dangerous.- On slowing and stopping, do so MUCH slower than usual.  Again, it's tough for the rider to judge how scary fast deceleration is, because we're holding onto something and leaning forward.  However, you'll figure it out fastbecause braking too fast will shove the passenger forward into you, which shoves you into the tank at an inopportune location.- Generally, have the passenger keep her knees against you and the bike, not out wide.  This helps balance and gives her somegrip.- When you passenger is in fear, she will squeeze her knees against you.Normally this means "slow down, and do it now!".  > turning so she leans *with* me, but what else?  Are there traditional> signals for SLOW DOWN!! or GO FASTER!! or I HAFTA GO PEE!! etc.???We only have a couple signals.  "Slow down" is her either tapping me on the back, or slapping my helmet with all her might.  Depends on the urgencyof the matter :-)"Turn here" is done by her pointing in the direction of an exit.  This isalso the sign for "cool!  Look at that."  "I hafta pee" is the same signas "turn here".  "I'm hungry" is the same sign.  "Go faster" is usuallydone by her jumping up and down on her pegs in glee.  I usually see "slowdown" more often than "go faster". > I really want this to be a positive experience for us both, mainly so that> she'll want to go with me again, so any help will be appreciated...The best thing to do before the ride is to talk to a riding buddy, and pillion on his or her bike.  It's incredibly frustrating, because you're in almost no control.  Now, multiply that feeling times ten, becauseyou as a rider know what your bike will do, and your passenger will likelyfeel you're about to scrape hard parts all the time, or lock up the brakesat any moment, or go careening off the edge of a volcanic mountain, etc.  Pillioning yourself is good training to take somebody on your pillion pad.Also, remember that it's much more draining and tiring to ride 2-upthan by yourself, because you're concentrating on much more, and"in the Zen of the moment" less.

Tough question -- more dangerous than driving a car, and far moredangerous if you don't apply a modicum of intelligence to the activity.  Basically, stupidity will get you hurt/killed a lotfaster on a motorcycle than in a car.  But with care, it isnot unreasonably dangerous.  Also, buying good protectiveclothing is helpful, that way if something does go wrong,you are likely to be less severely injured.First thing, if possible take a (MSF) driver training course,this will get you started on the right foot -- they teachcontrol of the vehicle and safe riding practices.Second, buy protective gear.  At minimum a good helmetand a pair of leather gloves are a must.  A good sturdy piece of footgear is also very helpful, though leather hikingboots, a pair of old army boots, or something similar works finefor this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay tied.  After those, a leather jacket and leather pants or chapsare nice as well; but these are also expensive items.  For thepants, many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable,preferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight.  Similarly fora jacket, a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise, thoughmore people tend to have leather jackets around than pants.  Anotherthing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second-handleather jacket.  Look for a fairly thick leather in these items.Third don't do anything stupid -- don't ride after drinking, even one drink can noticeably affect you judgementand balance; don't ride in the snow, or when conditionsare such that black ice is likely; be very careful ridingin the rain -- slow way down, take corners gingerly, brake early and gently;  try not to ride if you are sick,tired, taking any medication with drowsiness warnings, orotherwise not in average shape.With care, you should be ok.>The next question I have is what bike would you recommend for>a first time rider.

The maximum I can spend is about $2500 so>I'll be looking at a used bike.I would suggest mid to late 80's japanese mid-sized standard.Something in 400-650 cc range would probably be reasonable.  Ifyou are shorter/lighter than average, you might want to go aslow as a 300-400 cc bike.Possible models: The Suzuki GS### series (eg. GS500, GS650, etc.).  These are generallyinline 4 bikes, generally dependable except for a tendency to weakness in the charging system.  (Stator and/or Regulator/Rectifier problems.)  My first bike was a (about '82) GS650, it server me well.The Honda Nighthawk series (this may also be known as the CB### seriesI think).  eg. Honda CB450, CB650, etc.  This is another series ofstandard motorcycles.  Also fairly dependable.Kawasaki and Yamaha probably have similar bikes, but I don't knowthem as well.For mid to late '80s models of the above, you should be able tobuy the bike for under $2000, leaving you money for protective clothing and insurance and licensing costs.Hope this helps,-David(dagibbs@qnx.com)

If an engine's cylinder head design can benefit from this,then the splitfires will yield a slight performance increase, most noticeablyin lower rpm range torque. Splitfires didn't do diddly-squat for my 1992 GMCpickup (4.3l V6) but do give a noticeable performance boost in my 1991 HarleySportster 1200 and my best friend's 1986 Sportster 883. Folks I know who'vetried them in 1340 Evo motors can't tell any performance boost over plainplugs (which is interesting since the XLH and big twin EVO combustion chambersare pretty much the same shape, just different sizes). Two of my friends whohave shovelhead Harleys swear by the splitfires but if I had a shovelhead,I'd dual-plug it instead since they respond well enough to dual plugs to makethe machine work and extra ignition system worth the expense (plus they lookreally cool with a spark plug on each side of each head)-- =============================================================================Neal Howard   '91 XLH-1200      DoD #686      CompuTrac, Inc (Richardson, TX)      doh #0000001200   |355o33|      neal@cmptrc.lonestar.org      Std disclaimer: My opinions are mine, not CompuTrac's.

Oneguy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell.  Well,I saw one think that someone said about "Show me a team that used Split-fires...."  Well, here's some additional insight and some theoriesabout splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages.Splitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently andincreased power for the 4x4 cages.  Well, for these guys, splitfiresincreased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren't focusingon horsepower numbers.Now how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well, thatdepends.  Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine?In the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque,but 4's make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low.So for 4's, splitfires would not significantly increase power.But what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins,but many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up forthe hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell, Daytona 1992).  However,twins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does thistranslate?  Increased torque should "theoretically" help twins makemore power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra modsor anything made, just stick 'em in.Now I don't know about all of this (and I'm trying to catch up withsomebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than4's.        As far as racing teams....

You push your body off to the left.To do this, you have to push against something, and the onlything to push against is the ground (through the bike).

So, you pushed yourself off to the left by pushing on the ground to the right, and the ground pushed back toward the left.  Well, that push is on both wheels.  The rear wheel doesn't care (unless you have serious bearing problems) (except of course on the Spagthorpe Dragonfly, whichhad the revolutionary countersteering-contra-shaft-drive rear end), but the front wheel has trail.

Installation would have been very easy, but the seatfastening hardware was apparently always on the wrong sides withthe stock seat!  It never was easy to put on.  Once I figured thatout, the new seat went on the first try.  The passenger backrest, though,does not fit as I thought it might.  The supplied screw to set the backrest angle does not fit, and I have not yet found a suitable, hard, ( SAE grade 8, or perhaps 5 ) 1/4-20 bolt that fits.  There is aa soft bolt in there now -- just don't lean back.The driver's section of the seat is a bit wider.  Seems comfortableenough, but then again I put about 5000 miles on the stock seatwithout a thought.  The passenger's section has about 8 times the volume of foam that the stock seat has, and from my short test itseems much more comfortable.  The backrest helps a bit, but I've not has enough time to really test it.  The backrest also comes with a small pocket.  Its now more difficult to swing my leg up over the 10" taller seat.If I go on the three-notch ride soon ( Dixville, Pinkham & Smugglers),I'll give a more complete report, but in general it seems like animprovement.--  Frank Evan Perdicaro Xyvision Color Systems      Legalize guns, drugs and cash...today.101 Edgewater Drive   inhouse: frank@marvin, x5572Wakefield MAouthouse: frank@contex.com, 617-245-4100x5572018801285

However I expereince a severe power drop at cruising speeds under load. That is, on a mild upgrade @ 50 mph in 4th or 5th I'm lucky if I canhold speed.  If I try to add throttle much past 5000 rpm, power dropsdrastically.  Put simply, under load, the engine won't rev past 5000rpm.  The top third/half of the throttle range is dead.  Standing stillthe engine runs fine up to red line (9-10K).Other phenomenology: at about the point that power loss kicks in, theengine becomes a little wavery.  That is, at a steady throttle theengine speed goes up and down slightly.  The bike has about 13000 mileson it and is in good tune, at least until it starts to balk.I would appreciate any suggestions as to what's ailing the poor beast. My thoughts run toward clogged jets and/or improper spark advance.  I'mhoping it's not something more drastic since the bike's not really worththe hassle of any major engine work.

Now, in keeping with the  grand tradition of wreck.moto, let's  mutate!   Take your partners by the hand...   On Tuesday morning I spent a couple of hours (when I -should- have been   working) with a  torch, brazing bits  of scrap metal  over the  biggest   holes in  Yamadog's exhaust  pipes (s'mazin'  what you  can do  with  a   couple of AA  cells and a  three-volt bulb!).   I stuck some  "gun-gum"   into the smaller holes and bunged the pipes back onto the bike.   So, last night  I'm on the  way home  when lo' an'  bloody behold,  the   sodding thing starts  blowing again.   I check  it out and  the gas  is   escaping from around  the clamp holding  the number two  pipe into  the   port.  As far as I can see (it being somewhat "hole of Calcutta" at the   time!), the nuts are still there  (stop that bloody sniggering, you  at   the back!), but the pipe is a bit loose.   This morning  I go  out to  the bike  and pull  out the  socket-set  to   tighten up me' nuts (somebody give that  spotty kid at the back a  good   slap  round  the  back  of  the  head!),  and  lo'  an'  bloody  behold   a-bloody-gen, I find that the outer skin of the pipe has separated from   the inner sleeve right at the clamp-mating bevel.  So, I stuff in a bit   of baked-beanz can and a bit more of Mr Holts' very best "gun-gum"  and   come to work (late again!) so that I  can ask of the oracle...  Will  a   brazed joint hold that close to the exhaust port?  Anybody tried it?   Oh, and if anybody can tell me  what the differences are between a  205   and a  207  brazing  rod (made  by  "Gaz"  [Yup!   the  camping  folks.   Surprised the marmalade outa' me, too!] in that place just off the Isle   of Wight) I'd be eternally  grateful (twenty-sodding-quid for two  rods   and I don't even know what I'm buying.

Are there any easy ways to do this (i.e. a "slip-in" bulb replacement)?  2) Was told by a guy at the bike shop that my "not damn near bright enough" incandescent beam might be caused by a perma-low battery. So I went and picked up this cheapo "Motorcycle battery and charging system tester"... Hook it up to the battery, it's got 3 lights on "Very good charge"... Start the engine (to test the charging system), and it doesn't even REGISTER. It's supposed to light 5 or 6 lights if everything is OK, but it stays down at the same point as just the battery.  My question here is, if indeed my charging system is just plain messed up, how the HECK is the battery staying fully charged? I'd think it would be darned near dead from supporting my lights, etc...  Do the '75 CB360T's have a problem with their charging system? Are they just generally slower charging than what is normal for bigger bikes?  Is there an easy fix for this?  3) Happy noise: Put 300 miles on my bike this weekend, finally got myass an endorsement.... which is REALLY GOOD, because my cage just quit running worth a damn and I won't have money to repair it until the first... ;) And the weatherman says "Bright and Sunny all week, 20% chance of rain on friday"...  <big grin, bugs in teeth>

I've got a friend shopping for her first motorcycle.  This is great!Unfortunately, she needs at most a 28" seat.  This is not great.  So far,the only thing we've found was an old and unhappy-looking KZ440.So, it's time to tap the collective memory of all the denizens out there.Anybody know of models (old models and used bikes are not a problem)with a 28" or lower seat?  And, since she has to make this difficult ( 8-) ),she would prefer not to end up with a cruiser.  So there's bonus pointsfor listing tiny standards.I seem to remember a thread with a point similar to this passing throughseveral months ago.  Did anybody keep that list?Thanks!--Gregory Bean                                                           DoD #580bean@ncar.ucar.edu         "In fact, everything's got that big reverb sound..."

I purchased it viasome mail order catalog when the 4 year old battery in my Oldsmobile wouldrun down during Summer when I was riding my bike more than driving my car.Knowing I'd be selling the car in a year or so, I purchased the charger.Believe it or not, the thing worked.  The battery held a charge andenergetically started the car, many times after 4 or 5 weeks of justsitting.Eventually I had to purchase a new battery anyway because the Winter sunwasn't strong enough due to its low angle.I think I paid $29 or $30 for the charger.  There are more powerful, moreexpensive ones, but I purchased the cheapest one I could find.I've never used it on the bike because I have an E-Z Charger on it andkeep it plugged in all the time the bike is garaged.Arnie Skurow

If youre really cold the muffler willfeel fine till you leave all the charred skin on it when you peelyour hands off - I speak from experience. You can also do all kindsa (Americanism of the day) damage to your circulation warming hands up on something too hot. By far the best (fastest and safest)way to do it is to shove the hands up the opposit sleeves andstand there like a Ming emporer for a while. Five minutes should do it.
