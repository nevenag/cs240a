After a reviewwith a high school English teacher emphasizing participial phrases, youmight start with the Second Amendment, and follow it up with: 97th Congress, 2nd Session, Committee Print, *The Right To Keep and Bear Arms*, of the Subcomittee on the Constitution of the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, 97th Congress, Second Session, February, 1982.  GPO No. 88-618-OThis authoritative, heavily researched and annotated document clearlyturns your "interpretation" into specious claptrap, which is a politeway of saying utter bullshit.  In spite of your false assertion to thecontrary, the Second Amendment DOES protect the right of the individualcitizen, in his capacity as an individual, to keep and bear arms.And, Mr. Holland, IMHO, blatantly and harmfully false information,asserted as fact and globally distributed, deserves globallydistributed rebuttal in the forum in which it is posted.(And besides, this site doesn't carry t.p.g...:-)harryb%phred@data-io.comphred!harryb@data-io.com-----------------------------------------------------------------------No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.

Read it again yourself, then re-apply the admonition you gave to theprevious poster to yourself, as well.  The first clause is not a condition,it is a reason for explicitly supporting the right WHICH EXISTS, MILITIAOR NOT, that the people have a right to keep and bear arms.  This isNOT a right granted by the Constitution, it is a right presumed to existby default.  The Constitution mentioning a right is to prevent thegovernment from removing that right by stating very clearly the governmentshall NOT infringe (mess with, block, limit) that right.  Remember theConstitution is a bunch of negative things - things the government CANNOTdo.  All rights, etc not epxressly given to the government go to thestates and the PEOPLE (the same people the other 9 Amendments in theBill of Rights talk about).Since I am sure you will summarily reject my interpretation, I amappending a linguistic analysis by one far more expert than myself (andyou, I suspect).  I am sure you will find his qualifications adequate.If that isn't enough I can send you the Senate Subcommitee to theJudiciary on the Constitution report on the same thing...  There aresome things in there that Big Brother types, like Biden, etc must havereally had to swallow hard to admit.I think you will find that people that seriously study the Constitutionand state what it means will say the same thing.  Those who come upwith 'new improved meanings' are those who are trying to subvert theConstitution for a given agenda.  Like Clinton and his Clinton Cripple,Gun Control, People Control, and Control Control, and the whole nastymess.Please tell us how this person is in error, won't you? (And please back itup with some proof, since I am backing my assertion up with independentproof, and have a BUNCH MORE I can provide...).NOTE:  Followups set to talk.politics.guns--------- Begin included article -------THE UNABRIDGED SECOND AMENDMENT      by J. Neil SchulmanIf you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you'd ring up Carl Sagan,right ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to callwould be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you callif you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaningof the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?That was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the LosAngeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at HoughtonMifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as theforemost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr.Brocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professorjournalism at the University of Southern California and the author of"American Usage and Style: The Consensus."A little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud'sexpertise.Roy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decadesbefore embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism atUSC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with theprofessional aspects of journalism for "Editor and Publisher", a weeklymagazine focusing on the journalism field.He's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and MerriamWebster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud'sfifth book on usage, "American Usage and Style: The Consensus," has been incontinuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winnerof the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award.That sounds like an expert to me.After a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introducedmyself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sentthe following letter:"I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert inEnglish usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the UnitedStates Constitution, and extract the intent from the text."The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, beingnecessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keepand bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'"The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of thesentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of afree State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respectto the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'theright of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'"I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take intoconsideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restrictedentirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further,since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigationregarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whateveranalysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing tostand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify underoath to support, if necessary."My letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment,then concluded:"I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and taskwith this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it isvitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment.While I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance ofits results, I ask that you do this because of that importance."After several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms forhis doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of ouropinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other politicalsubject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I haveinserted my questions for the sake of clarity):[Copperud:] "The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to thesecurity of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in yourletter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than aclause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which isfollowed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential formaintaining a militia."In reply to your numbered questions:[Schulman:] "(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keepand bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?"[Copperud:] "(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and beararms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or byothers than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respectto a right of the people."[Schulman:] "(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' grantedby the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume apreexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely statethat such right 'shall not be infringed'?"[Copperud:] "(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existenceis assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall bepreserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia."[Schulman:] "(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear armsconditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in factnecessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is notexisting, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,shall not be infringed' null and void?"[Copperud:] "(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right tokeep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existenceof a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of theright to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulatedmilitia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keepand bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence."[Schulman:] "(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessaryto the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to placeconditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is suchright deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?"[Copperud:] "(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, aspreviously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of themilitia."[Schulman:] "(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulatedmilitia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,''well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?"[Copperud:] "(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superiorauthority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civiliancontrol over the military."[Schulman:] "(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account thechanged meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200years ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of theintents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated."[Copperud:] "To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in themeaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of theamendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: "Since awell-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, theright of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'[Schulman:] "As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would alsoappreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the SecondAmendment to the following sentence,"A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a freeState, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not beinfringed.'"My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,"(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the waythe words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?;and"(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the peopleto keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- forexample, registered voters with a high-school diploma?"[Copperud:] "(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels theamendment in grammatical structure."(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies thepossibility of a restricted interpretation."Professor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in hiscover letter: "With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculativeefforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reachany conclusion."So now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage whatmany knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionallyprotects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding allgovernments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.As I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in theSoviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in thatpart of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than theold guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.And here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointedofficials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United Statesignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely.American citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owningarms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirementsregarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is anabridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms,guaranteed by the Constitution.And even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of therest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms topreserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg ourelected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regardingthem as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges whodecide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means butmeans whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?Or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitutionof the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defendthat promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?(C) 1991 by The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation.Informational reproduction of the entire article is hereby authorizedprovided the author, The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation arecredited.

Seems to me that encryption ought tobe covered by the first amendment.   Using this line of reasoning, thegovernment shouldn't be able to restrict what data people encrypt andwhat encryption algorithms they use because this would be restrictingone's freedom of speech.  In other words, encrypted data---text,graphics, or other information---is just another form of free speech.For this reason the government shouldn't be able to regulate the useof encryption algorithms and encrypted data.  The only time thegovernment should be able to 'force' someone to reveal his or herencryption keys for some encrypted data is when the encrypted datain question may be something that isn't protected by the firstamendment such as kiddy porn.  Even in a case like this thegovernment should be required to get a search warrant before coercingsomeone into revealing the keys.BTW, what encryption methods are considered to be state-of-the-artnowdays.

Apparently no otherlegal activities occurred.  The jury was selected and thingsstart today.More interesting is what happenned outside.  About a dozenWeaver supporters showed up to stage a protest outside thecourthouse.  One woman carried a sign that read, "Who standstrial for the murder of Vicki and (son's name - I forget)Weaver?"  On the evening news she said, "I am here protestingbecause I believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion.I thought we all did."  Nice sound bite (grin)!The news reporter also interviewed some guy named "Tim"who refused to give his last name.  Not to prejudge theguy, but he looked like a neo-nazi.  He also said heexpected many neo-nazis to show up throughout the trial."Tim" had been handing out leaflets in support of Weaverand Harris and the news had footage of a Boise coptelling him to move along or he'd arrest.  I don't knowthe finer points of this one.  Perhaps there's a lawagainst political activity within X feet of a courthouseor something (what happenned to the First Amendment?!?).Most ominous of all was that the local reporter filmedan agent of the Gestapo...err...ATF with a minicamFILMING THE PROTESTORS!

At this point, it should be pointed out that in generala driver's licence in the U.S. is for the most part nothing like itsEuropean counterpart.  I understand getting one is far more difficultthere than here.  In the U.S. it's a joke.        But my usual objection is that you're discussing two differentthings.  For instance, in the U.S. a driver's license is a permitto operate a motor vehicle on a public road.  It is not necessaryto own one, or to operate it on private property.  That is, theability to require driving permits is generally considered to arisefrom the government's legitimate power to enact reasonable regulationsfor behavior on public lands.  A permit to own an automobile, for instance,which is far closer an analogy, would be a much harder thing to getpast legally, since it wouldn't be based on making regulations on publicproperty, but in restricting activity on private property.              >Use of guns in crimes (in Norway):>Some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners 'arms'>for a long time, but these are rather the exeption.>Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes, and mostly short >time befor the crime.>>Use of knives:>It IS allowed to cary knifes in public, but not in your belt or 'open'.>You (Americans) think it's ok to have a gun, but not to carry it open>in public -rigth ??        This varies *widely*.  (One thing I think Europeans havea difficult time with is that the U.S. has fifty unique jurisdictions,where the laws from one state to another can be as radically differentas from one country in Europe to another).        Some places allow open carry of both guns and knives.  Some allowconcealed.  Some prohibit both, or allow one or the other.  And it canbe either a state or local restriciton.       >Individual vs masses:>Yes the individual is more important than the masses, but only to some>extent....>Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses ??>What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of >all the others ??       The question must be asked:  Is the right of *this* individualaffecting the rights of this *other* individual.  What we usuallyget is that the rights of this *group* (meaning some individuals withinthis group, here defined as "people who own guns,") are adversely affecting the rights of some other group.         If for instance, "Bob" were using his gun to attack "Steve," you'dhave a point.  But essentially what we're discussing is that becuasesome person who qualifies as a member of the group "people who ownguns" then some third person, perhaps in another *time zone* is toldthat their being a member of that group is taking away somebody else'srights.  It's like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commitedby one.>The issue:>I believe the issue is GUNS, and gun-legislation.       The issue is crime, violence, and murder.  The question is towhat extent guns and gun legislation impact those.>We shouldn't mix weapons and items that can serve as one....>IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME.>But should it have to be like that ??       Of course not.  It would be nice if we didn't have to fear thatother people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt us.But currently we don't have that option.  Nor do I expect we will.>Do you think it's wise to sell guns like candy (some states do...) ??       No state does.  In any case, there's a limit to which the statemay enforce it's "wisdom" on me.  Freedom in general is an unwiseconcept.  If you pre-emptively restrict everything which might be"unwise" then freedom becomes a meaningless concept.   >If you believe it's smart/neccacery to have drivers-licence WHY do you think>it should be free to buy guns ??       I'll raise my hand against driver's licenses.  As currentlyimplemented they're a waste of time and little more than revanuegeneration for the State and ignored by a startling number ofdrivers.  It does not guarantee a level of skill any higher than isnecessary to get your car on the road and get yourself or somebodyelse killed, or a knowledge of traffic laws beyond what any ten yearold will have picked up riding around in his parents car.       But, as I mentioned, they're two different things.------------------------------------------------------------------------David Veal Univ. of Tenn. Div. of Cont. Education Info.

Officer Cranston struck Teenager A in the headwith a heavy police flashlight, causing a significant, though notlife-threatening.  THere is no evidence that Teenager A wasdoing anything threatening at the time.  Teenager A was releasedon bail/recognizance and filed a formal complaint against OfficerCranston.  The Police Chief suspended Cranston pending an investigation into the use of excessive force.  The above is pretty clear... but what seems to have happened is this.  The Chief requested Cranston's gun, but Cranstonrefused to turn it over until the Chief went the Cranston's home to get it.  Sources said Cranston had always wanted to bea cop and was very afraid of loosing his job because of the complaintagainst him.A few days afterward, Cranston allegedly walked into Wilson's Garage, where Teenager A and friends were known tohang out and work on cars as a hobby.  Cranston fatally shotTeenager A as well as TEenagers B and C.  Teenager D was shot oncein the shoulder/chest.  Teenager E was working under the carand was not noticed by Officer Cranston.  Teenager D went to a homeand summoned police, who went to Wilson's Garage and found the 3 corpses and one unscathed survivor.A few days after his arrest, Officer Cranston attempedto commit suicide in his cell.-Case Kim

Wow, you gotta love the speculation.       As I posted before, we import billions upon billions of rawores across the Mexican border.

I'd be willing to wager that a shipload of handguns would beworth more than a shipload of raw ore, *and* you're virtually guaranteedto get it past customs, because they'd have to hand search every hold ofevery ship which came through.       It's not simply a matter of how much money are they worth, but howmuch *more* money are they worth than other goods, based on the likelihoodof being caught.  Less money than drugs, but also a safer thing to smuggle.------------------------------------------------------------------------David Veal Univ. of Tenn. Div. of Cont. Education Info.

(Thereare about 500,000 criminal uses of guns in the US every year -- butonly 1,400 accidents.)  I don't think it's necessary to spend a lotof energy making sure a criminal CAN shoot a gun before he gets one.Just like the check, most gun owners feel positively about requiringsafety courses -- IF they couldn't be abused by the government.

I watched on satellite network feeds as  perhaps 90 people died before my eyes, while the two Huey's fanned the flames,  and the FBI stopped the firetrucks at the gate. Something was VERY wrong with that scene.Perhaps if I'd watched RAMBO movies, I might've been dulled to the pain of  fellow humans dying.Thank GOD I still feel.  I'm very sorry for you who don't.  For you who think  they got what they deserved.  Can you really believe that?  Even if Koresh was  the sadistic mad man they said he was, did the others deserve his fate?   If,  in fact, he was mad, wasn't that even more reason to believe he duped his  followers, and therefore they were innocent, brainwashed, victims?  Is there  any scenaro that justifies all that death?And if not, it is clear that the deaths would not have occured if the BATF has  not FUCKED UP initially, and now the FBI got impaitent and pushed Korech over  the edge.And that's if you buy the latest version of the "story" hook, line, and sinker.   I have believed all along that they could not let them live, the embarrassment  to the BATF and the FBI would've been too severe.Remember, this was a suspicion of tax-evasion warrant.  There were no  witnesses, except the FBI.  All information filtered through the FBI.  All they  had to do was allow one remote controlled pool camera be installed near the  building, and the press could've done their job, and would've been able to back  the FBI's story with close up video, while incurring no risk to the press.   Unless they did not want the public to see something.  The complete lack of any  other source of information other than the FBI really causes me concern.

Their faults were in intelligence(military and civilian definitions apply), tactics (attacking during DAYLIGHT??), methodology (the FBI stated that it is against government policy to assaulta position where there are non-combatants/potential hostages without attemptingnegotiations first), and legality.  The BATF's jurisdiction is TAXES on firearmsand tobacco.  They are a branch of the department of the treasury.  They havevery curiously backed away from their claims of illegal weaponry to push thechild-abuse charges... The BATF has no jurisdiction over non-firearms/tobaccoissues! And the charges of child-abuse had been investigated in the past withno violence and no validation.  This was a clear case of first the BATF, thenthe FBI, having watched too many Rambo movies...  My opinion is that the agentin charge should be charged with executing an illegal raid, criminal negligence,murder, civil rights violations, and breaking his/her oath to uphold and defendthe Constitution of the US.  The warrant should be unsealed to reveal to the public what justification the BATF thought it had in committing an armed assaulton American citizens.  And while on the issue of investigating this issue,the Randy Weaver case and the Johnny Lawmaster case should be investigated forBATF wrongdoing.Jamesbtw, if the BATF came busting in my windows with concussion grenades, you could damn well bet I would return fire to the utmost of my ability.-- ********************************************************************************James S.

This article does NOT claim that the GCA of 1968 is a "verbatim translation" of a Nazi law.  What it says is that in another place --the book they're talking about -- they compare the two things sectionby section.  The implication is that the similarities are devastating.In the next sentence, they talk about how in that book they reproduce the German text of the Nazi law, together with its translation.  Not surprisingly, a reader could easily conflate these two things into a single idea:  that the American GCA is a literal translation of the Nazilaw; and sure enough, that's what the whole thing has mutated into, urban-folklore style.2.  The article goes to great pains to establish that Senator Dodd had a copy of the Nazi law, either from his time on the Nurnberg prosecution team or later.  This fact is considered highly incriminating, but I don't understand why.  The author repeats several times that he is simply unable to imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and yet in a paragraph towards the end, he explains it perfectly:"If Dodd got his copy of the original German text of the Nazi WeaponsLaw during his time at Nurnberg, it likely was part of a collection ofdocuments, for example, issues of the Reichsgesetzblatt [the Germanlaw registry]."Bingo.  Exactly.  Dodd had a *book*, with a series of Nazi laws in it, including the oneunder discussion.  All of the stuff about "Why would a U.S. congressmanhave a copy of a Nazi law?" melts away, by the author's admission.  Hethen continues:  "But if he acquired the original German text of the Nazi Weapons Law after his service at Nurnberg, he must have done so for a very specific reason..."  But there's absolutely no reason to think that this is the case.  In fact, as a "senior member of the U.S. team that helped to prosecute Nazi war criminals", it seems to me thathe would have *had* to have a copy.  All arguments about whether the Nazi Weapon Law is really of historical interest (as it obviouslyis, certainly according to the author here), or whether Dodd personallyprosecuted the Interior Minister who signed it, can be put aside as red herrings.3.  Having established that Dodd owned a copy of the original German text, theJPFO article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he asked to have it translated.  The problem is, in the context of the charge levelled at Dodd, these two things work *against* each other.  People ask to have things translated when they *don't know what they mean*.  If Dodd took it upon himself to preserve the Nazi law with idea of someday introducing it into American law, surely by 1968 he would have know what it *meant*, wouldn't he?    Anyway, this precise charge -- the main one that I questioned in an earlierposting -- is just silly.  Why would Dodd need the exact translation for thispurpose?  Is the idea that the gun controllers, despite being presumably benton disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civilliberties, needed a crib sheet?  Didn't they have any idea how to do iton their own?    Once again, the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to hisown question: "Dodd may have offered his copy of the Nazi Weapons Lawto show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the Nazi law."  In fact, since the law and its translation *were* enteredinto the Congressional Record, under the heading of documents "concerningthe history of Nazism and gun confiscation", Dodd's motivation isn't a mystery:  he asked for the translation in order to put it in the CR.4.  Even this article makes it clear that the part of the Nazi law thatwas added *by* the Nazi regime is only a small part of that law.  Registration of guns, for instance, was begun in 1928, and thus NOTa "Nazi-inspired" idea.  The parts of the Nazi law that parallel the 1968 GCA include handgun control of some sort, and the identification of certain weapons as sporting weapons.  The JPFO then goes on to list other parts of the Nazi law, forbidding ownership of weapons by Jews;of course, there are no such provisions in the American GCA.  Nevertheless,in a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters, immediately after the discussion of the anti-Jewish parts of the law, the JPFO article continues, "Given the parallels between the Nazi Weapons Law and the GCA'68..." -- so as to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law.-- -- Don Porgesporges@inmet.camb.inmet.com..uunet!inmet!porges

Any ways one of Koresh's DEVOTED followers that DID I REPEAT DID survive this   "GENOCIDAL MASS-SLAUGHTER OF INNOCENT PEOPLE".  Besides there are nine    survivors in the burn-unit of the local hospital and was reported that David   was in one of the towers when the shit hit the fan.  Besides, a majority of    these children were children that he was supposed to have been the father of,   this then makes them bastard children to a sacraligious zeloit (sp).

After recieving much assistance from various T.P.G.type folks, I wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph,and surprise, surprise, surprise, they published it.  The text follows.The Colorado Daily, btw, is the University of Colorado (Boulder) student(I think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup, but every little bit, i guess...(The title was the only thing they changed/added)"Gun Stats"The Daily recently reprinted an article from theWall Street Journal, primarily concerned with PaxtonQuigley, author of "Armed and Female."  The article,in turn, cites a misleading statistic that was originallyreported in the New England Journal of Medicine.  Thearticle states, "A study... found that a gun in the homewas 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner,spouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder."  Thisis an often-quoted statistic, and it is misleading for sev-eral reasons, outlined below:The study gives the impression that, if you own agun, the likelihood that you will successfully use it todefend yourself is less than that of the gun being turnedagainst you.  The study, however, fails to take intoaccount cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gunto thwart a crime, without actually killing the perpe-trator.The study actually refers to 'acquaintances' ratherthan 'friend'.  This would include the friendly neigh-borhood thug who shows up like clockwork, everymonth, the second your grandmother cashes her socialsecurity check.  Possibly an acquaintance, but hardly afriend.The NEJM study is based on the immediate dis-position of cases and fails to take into account casesoriginally filed as homicides that were later ruled to beself-defense.  Especially considering the small samplesize (396), taking these events into account has a sub-stantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted.Criminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif-erent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to beused, successfully, by a private citizen against anaggressor than it is to kill anyone at all.  Further, per-sons defending themselves from aggression by using agun fare better than those who resist vicimization bysome other means, or who offer no resistance at all.Statistics available from the FBI and other agenciesalso show that a gun is 245 times more likely to beused by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threatthan to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 timesmore likely to be used to defend against a criminalthreat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 timesmore likely to defend against criminal threat than to beused to commit suicide.It is well to keep in mind that nearly anything canbe proved by uncritical quotation of statistics.  One hasto consider carefully what questions were asked bythose gathering the data before one can draw an accu-rate conclusion from them.D.F.

It would relieve thevarious states of the thorny problem of what to do with the hundredsof millions of dollars hunters pour into the economy annually. I'msure that, to attain sure a lofty, humane, liberal and ecologically(not to mention politically) correct goal, the environmental and animalrights groups/individuals supporting such a measure would be more thanwilling to add their names to a list of supporters seeking increasedtaxation to replace these lost revenues. I am equally confident thatthese same entities, given their noteworthy record in the area of socialresponsibility and respect for private property, would feel morallyand ethically bound to raise the necessary funds to acquire thehundreds of thousands of acres of land now held in private handssolely for use as private hunting preserves by the landowner(s). Todo less than this would place these same groups/individuals inthe ethically untenable (to say nothing of environmentally andpolitically incorrect) position of sanctioning the logging andsubsequent development and urbanization of these former privatehunting lands, which would no longer be useable by, or of anybenefit to, the landowner(s) in such a capacity.W.

Or why didn't they flee hours earlier when the tear gas was first introduced?  I can find no rational explanation for their behavior.--

Therefore, according to  Mane Logic(tm), gun control has made New York a much more dangerous place than  Rhode Island.

Where have we heard that before???No, Bill, my full original post included sufficient disclaimers so thatyou could see that I was not claiming that it was a perfect world fromthe Branch Davidians point of view. The point of my article was that itis inappropriate to compare Massada and the fate of the Jewish rebelsto Waco. The Zealot men faced certain execution in a way that wasanathema to their religion, and they knew that their wives and childrenwould be enslaved. American prisons may not be garden spots, but theydon't compare to what the survivors of Massada might have faced. Youindicate that you agree that the Branch Davidians faced a trial. Howdoes that fact alone make for a comparison here?  Even if thegovernment had wanted to find "fall guys" for the BATF deaths, theystill had to prove it to a jury.Once again, my point was quite simple--any comparison between thesituation of the Branch Davidians and the Jews of Massada is absurd.-- ________________________________________Jack F.

You started from the questionable premise that the fire was necessarily an act ofinsanity, rather than an act of negligence or an accident.  Recall, onesurvivor claims that the fire started when a tank knocked over a kerosene lamp.

There was no reference to sex or religion on the form."Nice evasive maneuver, Mr. Chekov, but they're still on our tail."Let me ask it more plainly.

Alas, this is not provable. I think that that> there are actually *few* cases where this is so. excerpted from a letter I wrote a while ago:     Although less apparent to those who have not researchedthe facts, personal protection is as legitimate a reason  assport for the private citizen to own a gun.  The most recentresearch  is  that  of Dr. Gary Kleck of the  Florida  StateUniversity  School of Criminology.1  He found that  handgunsare  more  often  used by victims to defeat  crime  than  bycriminals to commit it (645,000 vs. 580,000 respectively  inthis  study).  These figures are even more encouraging  whenyou  consider the number of crimes that never occur  becauseof  the  presence  of a gun in the hands  of  a  law-abidingprivate  citizen.  In a National Institute of Justice  studyof  ten state prisons across the country they found that 39%of  the  felons  surveyed had aborted  at  least  one  crimebecause  they believed that the intended victim was  armed.,and  57% agreed that "most criminals are more worried  aboutmeeting an armed victim than they are about running into thepolice."2     One  of the most heinous of crimes is that against  thewomen  of  this country.  It has been my recent  observationthat  more  women  are purchasing handguns  for  defense  inresponse  to  the  present danger of these  assaults.   Thisshould be taken as encouraging news if the events of OrlandoFlorida  are any indicator.  In the late 1960's  the  femalepopulace was plagued with a series of brutal assaults;  justthe  publicity of the record number of women buying guns andobtaining training resulted in an 88% decrease in  rape  forthat  area,  the  only city of its size in  the  country  toexperience a decrease of crime for that year.  Additionally,a 1979 US Justice Department study of 32,000 attempted rapesshowed  that overall, when rape is attempted, the completionrate  is 36%. But when a woman defends herself with  a  gun,the completion rate drops to 3%. 1 G Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America Aldinede Gruyter, NY, 19912 JD Wright & PH Rossi Armed and Considered Dangerous:  ASurvey of Felons and Their Firearms, Aldine de Gruyter, NY,1986-------__________________________________________________________________________[unlike cats] dogs NEVER scratch you when you wash them.

Ideally, these questions could beasked at any investigation into the BATF's and FBI's participationat the WACO fiasco in hopes of being resolved and, hopefully, wakeup the local news media that they are not getting the entire truthfrom the BATF and FBI.  My list is up to 13 that are really nagging at my gut.  The list will probably grow. 1.   What were the contents of the original warrant, now sealed, that     the BATF obtained?2.   It is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and/or ammunition     could not be flushed down the toilet.  Therefore, a "no-knock"     raid could be ruled out.  Prior to the initial assault on the      complex, did a single BATF agent and accompanying witness (without      a contingent of assault and news media personnel) attempt to knock      on the door of the Branch Davidian's complex and serve the warrant      in a manner prescribed by law?3.   On the day of the initial assault on the complex, BATF agents     were aware that several small children were inside the buildings.     In the ensueing gun battle, BATF agents fired into a building     known to contain children, killing at least one two-year old child.     Knowing children were present, why didn't the BATF have an     alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to     the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening     fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building? 4.   The FBI spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that     David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians possessed over     $200,000 in firearms and ammunition.  Did David Koresh and the     members of the Branch Davidians have a valid Federal Firearms     License, were they actively participating in the legal business     of selling/buying firearms and ammunition, and were any of the     weapons they had illegally possessed?  Does this paper evidence     consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally     dispossessed weapons.5.   After the original assault on the compound tragically failed,     a BATF spokeswoman stated "We were outgunned!".  Yet, TV newscasts     of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show BATF agents     armed with MP-5 and AR-15/M16 rifles.  Although unclear on the     video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent's     bodies, they also may have had AK-47 and SKS rifles.  What type(s)     of firearms did the BATF agents have immediate access to at the      scene of the original assault on the complex?6.   Since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the     complex involuntarily, why did the FBI treat it as a "hostage"     situation? 7.   Along the same lines, why did the FBI use "psychological warfare"     techniques, including sensory overload, sleep deprivation, and     other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any      normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the      complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind?8.   Reports indicate several of the children inside the complex     were accompanied by their mothers.  Since it is reasonable     to expect these mothers would have their children taken away     from them if they came out, why did the FBI expect the mothers     to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities?9.   Agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the Branch     Davidians setting fire to the complex.  Branch Davidian members     who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an      armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a      lantern which was setting on a table.  Video tape of the incident      does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the      fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location.       Was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle      penetrated?10.  FBI spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the David Koresh and     the members of the Branch Davidians committed mass suicide.  Yet,     bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas     within the building complex.  This seems to be counter to any     known mass suicides through history.  What evidence does the FBI     have that a mass suicide pact existed?11.  FBI Director Sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on     the video tape was caused by the Branch Davidian's ammunition     and/or powder cache exploding.  Yet, the fireball seems to be     more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas     or other highly volatile fuel source explodes.  Was any evidence      found which would indicate the Branch Davidians had an ammunition      and/or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball?  If so,     and if David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians were      engaged in the legal business of selling/buying firearms, was the     amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect     for someone engaged in such a legal business?12.  It is rumored that one FBI agent was extremely upset about critical     news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to     crush a reporter's car which had been left at the compound.  Is      there any factual basis to this rumor and, if so, what charges will      be brought against the FBI agent who performed the act?13.  FBI Director Sessions states that, during the final assault on the     complex, "over 80 shots were fired at the vehicles."  On the video     tape of the incident, you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles     engines.  Yet, there is no sound of the sharp reports that one     would expect to hear if shots were fired.  Also, there are no      indications of smoke and/or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows,     buildings or other structures in the video.  Surely, these should be      evident if the Branch Davidians had fired on the armored vehicles.       Finally, the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter,      sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be      apparent if the Branch Davidians had fired upon the vehicles.  Do      any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas      into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by      shots from high-power rifles?14.  CS gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent.  The United     States has signed international treaties which prevent the use     of CS gas in warfare.  If the United States could not morally use     CS gas against Saddam Hussein and his troops, why is it morally     acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land?15.  On April 21, FBI spokesmen state that at least 3 bodies discovered     in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had     been murdered or had committed suicide.  On April 22, the county     coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet     wounds to the head.  Were any of the victims bodies found within     the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head?-- *************************************************************** Ron Phillips               crphilli@hound.dazixca.ingr.com ** Senior Customer Engineer                                   ** Intergraph Electronics                                     ** 381 East Evelyn Avenue               VOICE: (415) 691-6473 ** Mountain View, CA 94041              FAX:   (415) 691-0350 ***************************************************************

Oak Park also has an illegal handgunban as well, but does allow those with a "collectors FFL" to possess("collectible?") handguns.|What would the penalty if you were found out be?Probably a fine in practical terms.|What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting in your apartment |there?  How would the city law apply to your impending |trial for the shooting?It wouldn't impede your defense at all. There was an actual incidentin Oak Park where a gas station owner engaged in a shootout with ahandgun; the grand jury decided not to presecute. On the other hand,a black man used an illegally owned handgun in Oak Park to defendhimself, and the Village tried to make an example out of him. An NRADirector who lived there made a stink about this, and it was decidednot to charge the guy. Of course, pissing off anti-gun police thugshas it's own drawbacks, like when the Oak Park Police Chief came to hishouse, and told him: "this is stepping over the line; this could getdangerous for you." Whereupon the few black Oak Park police officerswatched over his house to ensure that the white anti-gun police chiefand his anti-gun cronies wouldn't f*ck with him, his home or family.|Also, what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons?  Short barreled|shotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available, |either that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie Colt, Marlin).  L.V. Cipriani states that the "Any other weapon" category is allowed,but the exact relationship between an Ithaca Auto-burgular, which Ibelieve is in the "Any other weapon" category and a chopped barrelH&K HK-94 (Class 3 for sure) is not clear to me...|One more thing, what is the chance of getting a CCW permit in IL without being|rich or famous or related to the mayor?In your dreams, buddy. As long as Democrats reign in Chicago, Illinoisresidents will always be disarmed and helpless in the streets. Politiciansget around this by provisions in the law that allow them to carryconcealed weapons. Voters in Chicago are too stupid to vote these a**holesout of office; because the Dems are always in power, the Illinois Supreme Court is always tilted to the Democratic Party's views on guns.[All candidates supported by political consultant David Axelrod areanti-gun, which explains anti-RKBA Crook County States Attorney Jack(ass) O'Malley being a so-called "Republican."]Get rid of the Chicago Democrats, get rid of their members on the ILJudiciary, and you got a fighting chance of a preemption law and a CCWlaw...

And is there credible evidence for the assertion that they are "pledged to defend secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood"?  I've known only a few Mormons; but none of them seemed to me to fit this description.  Sounds to me reminiscent of the Jewish- and Masonic-conspiracy theories of blessed memory.--sa

The item is clear and concise in it's present form my young   friend! It does not need my clarification or that of any other.

It was explained that two news photographers were found on the compound earlier this morning without permission.  It was explained to the press corps. that this is dangerous and that an unknown photographer turning around with a long lens camera could be mistaken for someone dangerous by a Texas Ranger surveying the site. (!)  The two photographers were said to be currently in jail and the press were warned to follow the authorities' guidelines.  It was also emphasized that the survey of the "crime" scene at this point was crucial and that the press could not be allowed to interfere.The press will not be allowed in until the bodies are removed and the site has been completely surveyed for evidence for a court case.  That is the gist of the beginning of the conference to the best of my memory.  I bring this up because I haven't seen anyone else note it and I haven't seen the regular newscasts mention it.  It will probably be mentioned in the papers tomorrow.My opinions:-----------I find this disturbing.  While I believe that Koresh is largely responsible for not ending this standoff in a peacable manner during the last 51 days of patient opportunity, I find the secrecy surrounding the aftermath more damaging to the authorities' position than they realize.Since the vast majority of potential defendents in a court case are already dead, the emphasis on the importance of building the court case seems overblown to me.It will be interesting to see the hearings on this affair.  I have also heard congressional calls for a review and possible overhaul of government enforcement agencies which you will recall I have stated would be a good idea in previous months.Please also note that I by no means endorse  or agree with the many conspiracy-type theories I have read here and in other groups.  As usual, I am basing my opinions on info gathered from various media and filtered by my own common sense and consideration of plausibility, IMHO.  As such, my opinion is subject to change as more information is made available.Scott Roby                                                Standard Disclaimer--

I haven't ground through much in the way of numbers yet, but a coupleof things jumped out at me.  First only 1986 and 1987 specify the type ofweapon used in self defense.  1988, 1989, and 1990 refer only to "weapon."The second is that while assaults rose about 3% from 1986 to 1987, w/gundefenses reported *fell* by almost 25%.  Unless there's an explanation forthis, I'm tempted to mark it as a reporting problem, and as such going ahead with any examination of the numbers would be a waste of time.      Anybody have an idea what might have cause a real difference, andnot just a reporting difference?  The survey doesn't appear to havechanged significantly between 1986 and 1987.------------------------------------------------------------------------David Veal Univ. of Tenn. Div. of Cont.

This was even during the 9 month period when he was beingwatched.  One wonders why the BATF went ahead, when they had been warnedaccording to an interview with a BATF agent, that the BD were expectingthem, and why they had the media in tow.  Almost looks like they wantedto have a romp and a nice show for the media, and it all went to hell...He was also never known to act violently.  He has always surrenderedpeacefully before (but of course, the warrants were served peacefully).He has been tried on the allegations before and found NOT GUILTY.The justification for this mess was he was alleged to have purchased$200,000.00 worth of guns and stuff (over an undetermined time period).Last I heard this is not a crime, or indication of one.  I know of anINDIVIDUAL with that much value in guns.  SHould he get a fly-thru-the-doorshoot-first-talk-later raid?  (grenades are shooting first, nobody Iknow of can say 'oh, thats only a stun grenade, thats OK...').  Can you?I sure cannot.  Also, one cannot be sure that 200K figure is not calculatedlike the Feds calculate the value of a drug siezure...  Even so, itis a 'so what' issue...  He wasn't bothering anyone (besides theBATF who doesn't like folks other than themselves or other govtpeople having any effective guns)... and having an unapprovedreligeous group.  Are we required to not offend the BATF thesedays?  I sure hope it hasn't come to THAT...MY point is, it DOES NOT ADD UP.  We need an independent investigation,and NOW.  Assuming other than FBI/BATF are preserving the evidence.>2) Could a further wait have resulted in a different outcome.They had the premisis bugged.  I am inclined to think a further waitwould have saved lives.  One wonders why they didn't have emergencygear on hand when they moved, and why they didn't turn on the waterwhen a fire was observed, instead of saying "aw, gee, there is no water".Why so long before the fire gear even SHOWED UP - like after the buildinghad pretty much finished burning?  Fireman safety?  Isn't that a decisionthe firefighters should be allowed to make?  No water?  Why didn'tthe Feds TURN IT BACK ON?  They sure could cut it off quickly enough...One does wonder about the possibility of 'settling scores'...>3) Were FBI actions (blaring loudspeakers, etc.) the "right" course of action?>>And a few other questions.  Like I said, I believe the actions taken, in>general, were proper.  But I still have some reservations.>>One other point, I'm no fan of Janet Reno, but I do like the way she had the>"balls" to go ahead and take full responsibility.  Seems like the waffle boy>had problems figuring out just where he stood on the issue.What does 'taking responsibility' mean?  You think she is going to befacing jail time if the acts were found to be criminal?  You thinkshe is going to face ANY repercussions if the FBI/BATF are found tohave acted wrongly?  I don't.  It is a nice PR gimmick, though.I am not assured there will even be a serious independent investigationfor possible wrongdoing or criminal acts on the part of the BATF or FBI.I expect to hear "they are our best law enforcement.  They wouldn't doanything like that - NO WAY.  OUT of the QUESTION.  End of issue".I want to see an INDEPENDENT investigation, with full prosecuting andsubpoena powers.

Only>21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred...That is a gross distortion: "Self-defense" does not mean killingthe attacker. There were 21 cases of civilians killing their attacker in self-defence. But such cases represent less that0.5% of the crimes prevented by armed self-defence; for everycase you cite, there were over 200 other cases of self-defencewhere the crime was prevented but the attacker was not killed.(0.5%, by the way, is the most conservative possible figure,based on the National Crime Survey's estimate of 80,000crimes prevented by armed self-defence each year. Most other studies on the subject put the figure at 500,000 to 600,000.Those figures would imply less than 0.08% of sucessful self-defencesinvolve killing the attacker.) So, more correctly, there over 4000 (possibly as many as 25,000) cases of civilians acting in self-defence, only 21 of which resultedin the death of the attacker. This is a significant factor, incomparison to the 592 homicides. If memory serves, homicidesmake up approximately 1% of the violent crimes the studyconsidered, so the fair comparison would be 40 - 250 homicidesprevented and 592 homicides. Clearly, the study can not beclose to accurate, since it ignored these cases of self-defence.

Your sweeping: generalizations evince your own ignorance. What were they supposed to do?: Just let him be? Yes.

The cult's leaders, who claim that God speaks to them, have told cult members to arm themselves in preparation for the end of the world, which they believe to me imminent. Weapons believed to be in their possession include large-bore military weapons as well as sporting arms.  A recent series in nearby newspapers has exposed the plans of the cult to take power throughout the region. Troops have surrounded the cult's "city" after incidents in which officials have exchanged shots with cult members.  There have been reports of children being seen in the cult compound, where discipline is said to be strictly administered. Governor Liliburn Boggs has issued an order that these "Mormons" are to be exterminated, or driven from the state..-----------------------------------------------------------------------And that's the news account, from 150 years ago..> |> We used to live in a country where everyone enjoyed the free exercise of> |> their rights to worship and bear arms.

In my opinion, the BD's were as much a real threat to societyas the Mormons were then or are now.  (That is, until they were provoked.)By the way, I find your statement about "non-Nazi" law ironic.  Koresh was suspected of violating the Gun Control Act of 1968, which was BASED ON thetext of the Nazi Weapons Law of March 18, 1938.  ("Gun Control's Nazi Connection;" Jews for Preservation of Firearms Ownership, 2872 S. Wentworth Ave., Milwaukee, WI 53207, (414) 769-0760.)By the way, what was Koresh's specific violation?

(Flames to /dev/null)--------- Begin Enclosed Article -----------THE UNABRIDGED SECOND AMENDMENT      by J. Neil SchulmanIf you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you'd ring up Carl Sagan,right ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to callwould be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you callif you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaningof the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?That was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the LosAngeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at HoughtonMifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as theforemost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr.Brocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professorjournalism at the University of Southern California and the author of"American Usage and Style: The Consensus."A little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud'sexpertise.Roy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decadesbefore embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism atUSC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with theprofessional aspects of journalism for "Editor and Publisher", a weeklymagazine focusing on the journalism field.He's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and MerriamWebster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud'sfifth book on usage, "American Usage and Style: The Consensus," has been incontinuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winnerof the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award.That sounds like an expert to me.After a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introducedmyself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sentthe following letter:"I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert inEnglish usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the UnitedStates Constitution, and extract the intent from the text."The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, beingnecessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keepand bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'"The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of thesentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of afree State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respectto the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'theright of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'"I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take intoconsideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restrictedentirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further,since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigationregarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whateveranalysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing tostand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify underoath to support, if necessary."My letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment,then concluded:"I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and taskwith this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it isvitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment.While I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance ofits results, I ask that you do this because of that importance."After several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms forhis doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of ouropinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other politicalsubject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I haveinserted my questions for the sake of clarity):[Copperud:] "The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to thesecurity of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in yourletter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than aclause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which isfollowed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential formaintaining a militia."In reply to your numbered questions:[Schulman:] "(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keepand bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?"[Copperud:] "(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and beararms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or byothers than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respectto a right of the people."[Schulman:] "(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' grantedby the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume apreexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely statethat such right 'shall not be infringed'?"[Copperud:] "(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existenceis assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall bepreserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia."[Schulman:] "(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear armsconditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in factnecessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is notexisting, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,shall not be infringed' null and void?"[Copperud:] "(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right tokeep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existenceof a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of theright to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulatedmilitia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keepand bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence."[Schulman:] "(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessaryto the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to placeconditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is suchright deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?"[Copperud:] "(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, aspreviously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of themilitia."[Schulman:] "(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulatedmilitia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,''well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?"[Copperud:] "(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superiorauthority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civiliancontrol over the military."[Schulman:] "(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account thechanged meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200years ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of theintents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated."[Copperud:] "To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in themeaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of theamendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: "Since awell-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, theright of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'[Schulman:] "As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would alsoappreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the SecondAmendment to the following sentence,"A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a freeState, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not beinfringed.'"My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,"(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the waythe words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?;and"(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the peopleto keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- forexample, registered voters with a high-school diploma?"[Copperud:] "(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels theamendment in grammatical structure."(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies thepossibility of a restricted interpretation."Professor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in hiscover letter: "With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculativeefforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reachany conclusion."So now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage whatmany knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionallyprotects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding allgovernments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.As I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in theSoviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in thatpart of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than theold guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.And here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointedofficials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United Statesignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely.American citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owningarms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirementsregarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is anabridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms,guaranteed by the Constitution.And even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of therest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms topreserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg ourelected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regardingthem as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges whodecide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means butmeans whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?Or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitutionof the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defendthat promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?(C) 1991 by The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation.Informational reproduction of the entire article is hereby authorizedprovided the author, The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation arecredited.

Why wouldn't they have "goneout in the proverbial blaze of glory" and "come out shooting" with an attitudeof "let's take as many of those dogs as possible with us"?Instead, they seemed to have preferred death to whatever they thought was instore for them at the government's hands.It's totally immaterial whether they were all crazy, all fanatics, all followersof the antichrist, haters of the government, practicers of weird lifestyles, orwhatever...they must have felt that they were being pressured into renouncingtheir beliefs, however how strange or lunatic those beliefs might appear to "youand me". There is much precedent for such devotion to cause.My conclusion at this point is that the "authorities" seriously misread theirdanger to society (else why did the BD's not do as suggested above) and/or chosethis incident to make some heinous point or satisfy some internal agenda, up toand including AG J.

I believe that this is not quite correct. My understanding is that LDS isengaged on a project to "convert" the souls of deceased persons of otherreligions, in order to spare them from damnation and gain them entrance intoheaven. To this end, the Church has compiled extensive genaeological records, sothat they will know the names of people to convert. A long article in the NewYorker a few years ago described the LDS research methods in some detail (forexample, some researchers pay visits to local native storytellers to learn thenames of people long dead). This sounds like just the sort of lie that would bemade up about any unusual religion, but the New Yorker story convinced me thatthere is some truth to it (the New Yorker used to do extensive fact-checking, andthe story was quite detailed).Ari

This is a metal part which physically seperatesthe cartridge and the firing pin: Even under impact, the guncannot fire. The hammer block is connected to the trigger andis pulled out of the way as the trigger is pulled. As a result,modern pistols can fire _only_ if the trigger is pulled (or in some cases, if they are cocked by hand and then dropped.) >> The number of people killed in this manner far outweighs the number of>> deaths caused by animal attacks or "wacko" attacks combined.I don't know about animal attacks, but there are 23,500 murders each year and under 500 die in the manner you suggest. If only2.1% of the murders were killings by "wacko"s, you would bewrong. Worse, there are also 102,500 rapes and 1,055,000 aggravatedassaults each year. These numbers make violent attacks, and preventing them, thousands of times more significant than theaccidents you are worried about.(These figures, by the way, are from the FBI's "Uniform CrimeReport" for 1990.

Here we have a self-described libertarian    getting all sentimental over a religious and national entity   not exactly known for respecting individualism.   In somewhat   more detail it should be noted that the whole concept of a    religion, and especially a patriarchial one like Judaism    (or Islam, or Christianity) is obediance to rules and authority.   Leviticus, Deuteronomy, etc are FULL of "thou shalt"s and "thou   shalt not"s.   And of course Israel's concept of human rights, while   no doubt better than places like Syria's or Iraqs, is hardly the    stuff to warm the cockles of a libertarian's heart.---peter

The Trib. wouldrun a graphic of a handgun.  The Examiner would not have a Tradersad at all.Over the past year while Oakland politicians have made a lot of noiseabout measures to fight crime the Trib stopped taking the Tradersad, then started publishing it, but without any handgun graphic, thenstopped, then started.

They still arm themselves to "defend thefaith", and stockpile food as well.  They have been involved in quite alot of illegal activity - including multiple (and often underage) wivesfor the leaders - a practice still in vogue with some splinters of theirsect.  The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking.So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J. Edgar Hoover was veryimpressed with the way they kept secrets.  (They're pledged to defendsecrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood.  Many actuallydo - even to the point of suicide.)  So he hired virtually no one butMormons, until the FBI was almost exclusively staffed by members of theChurch of Later Day Saints.  Though J. Edgar is finally gone, the FBIpersonnel (especially the field agents) are still heavily Mormon.I have often wondered how this might affect the FBI's treatmentof religious organizations a Mormon would consider heretical.-- ==========Michael McClarymcclary@netcom.comFor faster response, address electronic mail to:michael@node.com

He left his third-floor bedroom and beganlooking around the house, making sure women and children were secure and checking that everyone had their gas masks on properly. Within hours, the    compound became an inferno. Nine Branch Davidians excaped.   This is their story, gleaned from lawyers who spoke with six of themwho are jailed on charges that include conspiracy and murder. That day the six said a portable radio offered the only contact with the outside world    since Koresh's right-hand man, Steve Schneider, ripped out the compounds's phone line after FBI agents called before dawn Monday saying this was thecults last chance: Come out or prepare to get forced out.    They kept their word. By dawn, tanks were battering the Mount Carmelcompound, punching for hours to creat holes for tear gas to enter. The BDmeanwhile proceeded with their daily routines. Strapped into gas masks, thewomen did laundry. Others read Bibles in their rooms. The 17 children, allunder 10, remained by their mothers' sides. Still, it was hard to ignore what    was happening around them. Each time a tank rammed the poorly-constructed buildingit shook violently. Cult members dodges falling gypsum wallboard and doors.Hundreds of gas canisters hurled in from the armored vehicles were fillingthe air with noxious fumes. The flying canisters were more frightening thanthe tanks. At least one man was hit in the face. The gas began filling the air,driven by heavy gusts of wind coming through windows and the holes the tanksmade. Scattered throughout the house, the cult members made no efforts togather. Then the FBI sent in its biggest weapon -- a massive armored vehicleheaded for a chamber, lined with cinder blocks, where authorities hoped to find Koresh and Schneider and fire tear gas directly at them.  Here the cult members' story diverges from the government's version. TheFBI says cult members set fires in three places. But each of the six cultmembers, in separate discussions with lawyers, consistently gave versionsat odds with the FBI's account. They say the tank flattened a barrel of propane, spilling its contents. And as the tank thundered through the house,it tipped over lit lanterns, spitting flames that ignited the propane andother flammables. The home of used lumber, plywood, and wallboard tacked together with tar paper was vulnerable. The building erupted. Nine BD'sescaped jumping through windows and dashing through other openings. Othersdied groping in the blackness.Frank

Glover>----------------The Cold War has not ended.  The only thing that has happened is that the two sides have exchanged roles.The USA has a higher imprisonment rate (400 per 100,000 population)than any country in Europe by a factor of 10 or so.  In California,it is over 600 per 100,000 population.  The prison population inCalifornia is now over 100,000, a quadrupling since 1980.  Most ofthese inmates were convicted under the drug prohibition laws.  Policenow confiscate property, without trial, under a "good faith probablecause" standard, in the name of depriving the horrible ghastly drugdealers of their ill-gotten gains.  Conduct an opinion poll, and amajority will answer "yes" if you ask them whether civil liberties anddue process should be diluted in order to Send Our Young People TheMessage That We Are Serious About Winning The War On Drugs.  I don'tknow whether anyone has measured such a figure among gun owners, butI would expect the same result.  They certainly seem to vote that way.According to Jack Herer's book _The Emperor Wears No Clothes_, overTWELVE MILLION YEARS of prison time have been served under themarijuana prohibition laws, by people who were minding their ownbusiness and causing no harm to others (and less harm to themselvesthan users of tobacco, with 400,000 confirmed kills/year).  Underthe "War on Drugs" campaign of "zero tolerance" due process protectionshave eroded, and mandatory sentences of ten years without parole haveproliferated.  By and large, gun owners have voted for the politicianswho favor such measures.  And now, all the precedents--not onlylegal, but political:  "My fellow Americans, we must send our youngpeople the message that we are serious about winning the War OnMurder"--are going to be applied to the oncoming wave of gunprohibition laws.  Gun owners are about to get a taste of the medicinethey voted for believing it would be used only on those with differenttastes in recreational drugs.What goes around comes around.    Alan T.

If the body had been denatured (cooked) or dehydrated dueto the heat, a projectile needs only a minimal kinetic force to penetrate.In fire aftermaths, bodies tend to fall apart or loose large chunks ofmeat with little effort. Medical Examiners tend not to like cleaning upsuch scenes. As such, if the body had been suitably cooked, a bullet comming from amagazine explosion would more than likely have enough force to enter andthus it would be difficult to determine whether a bullet entered at thetime of death, or much later, unless you were trained to look for theevidence.

For example, "wet"modifes "day" in the phrase "a wet day."The amendment is similiar to the statement:A wet day, being annoying, the right of the people to keepand wear boots, shall not be infringed.So how does a dry day pertain the right to use boots?  Similiar,what does the "unorganized militia" have to due with the right toown guns?-> The sentence [in the Second Amendment] doesn't restrict the right, or-> state or imply possession of the right by anyone or anything other-> than the people.  All it does is make a positive statement regarding a-> right of the people. The PEOPLE, as in you and me, as in the First,-> Fourth, Ninth, Tenth, as well as the Second amendment.-> The existence of this right is assumed - it is not granted by the-> amendment. There is no stated or implied condition relating the right-> to bear arms to the necessity of a well-regulated militia to the security of-> In other words, the entire sentence says that the right to keep and-> bear arms is UNCONDITIONAL.No not, unconditional, but "shall not be infringed".  Infringedis defined as:To break or ignore the terms of or obligations (an oath, an agreement, law, or the like); to disreguard; violate.To go beyond the boundaries or limits; tresspass; encroach.This definition implies the following of some form of existing agreement.  Laws and agreements are made in advance.  Boundaries or limits of behavior are set by society as a whole.  The word "unconditional" implies no agreements or all previous agreements are off, which is the opposite.The words used in the first amendment are much stronger, i.e.,"congress shall make no law," are much stronger.  They clearly          ^^^^^^^^^^^imply "unconditional."  If the writers of the amendment, wanted unconditional whay didn't they says, "congress shall make no laws pertaining the the right of the people to keep and bear arms"?The second amendment implies a sort contract between the peoplethe people and the state.  The bigger part of the contract isthe people have the right to overthrew the government and its lawsat any time.  To guarantee this right, the laws cannot stoppedthe people from forming a "well regutaled militia."  The dutiesof a "well regulated militia" to the government are descussed in Federalist No. 29.  And the limits of of the governmental controlof the militia are descussed in Article I Section 8, Article II Section 2, and the Second Amendment of the constitution.-- +-----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+|                             |  "If only it were a modern document, with a   || John Lawrence Rutledge      | smart index and hyper links stretching all    || Research Assistant          | through the world data net.

Then you can come home to something like this:    "Well, it's been a rough month," begins Johnnie Lawmaster.  "I just get laid off, and my divorce became final.  But I just wasn't ready for what happened this particular Monday."    That particular Monday was was December 16, the first day of the Bill of Rights' third century, the day when federal agents and local law enforcement officer broke into the house in Tulsa that always flew the U.S. flag.  When Lawmaster drove into the driveway that bleak afternoon, one of his neighbors had some news.    "'Ohmigod, John, you are in big trouble!' my neighbor tells me. 'Sixty police, federal agents and the bomb squad busted in you house, kicked down the door, cut locks off your gun safe.'  I couldn't believe it.  Then I walked inside.  What a nightmare."    It was no nightmare; it was horribly real life.  Apparently acting on information the Lawmaster possessed an illegal firearm, some thirty agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) teamed up with state and Tulsa police authorities, search warrant in hand, to search for a "Colt, AR-15, .223 caliber machine gun, unknown serial number."  The warrant, issued by U.S. Magistrate John Leo Wagner, also authorized agents to seize "any tools used in the alteration or modification of firearms, such as files or drills; documents, papers, books, records, and other tangible properties which identify occupants or owners of the property to be searched...."    Reports vary, but according to neighbors, the joint task force operation aimed at the unemployed warehouseman from a nearby hospital involved some 60 agents and local law enforcement personnel against Lawmaster.  They cordoned off the street; took station with weapons drawn in the back yard; used a battering ram to break through the front door; kicked in the back door; broke into his gun safe; threw personal papers around the house; spilled boxes of ammunition on the floor; broke into a small, locked box that contained precious coins; stood on a table to peer through the ceiling tiles, breaking the table in the process.  Then, they left.  The doors were closed but not latched, much less locked.  The ammo and guns were left unsecured.    "My front and back doors were pulled shut, but they were busted through and couldn't latch.  Anybody could have waltzed in there and stolen everything I own.  A child could have taken a gun.  The guns, the safe -- everything was open and laying around.  I keep all my magazines empty, but someone had loaded them.  While I was looking around in amazement, the gas, electric and water companies show up to turn the power off.  They said they were told to shut things down. Then I found the note.  "Nothing Found - ATF."    "They didn't make any attempt to notify me.  I've lived in Tulsa all my life and never got more than a traffic ticket.  How come they can't look that up, realize I've been law-abiding my whole life, then come to the door when I'm home?  They didn't leave someone here to watch over my private property.  They didn't even come by to explain what happened.  They just raided my home, ransaked it, left it wide open and left."    Lawmaster placed a phone call to the local BATF agent.  "I asked, 'Are you gonna' arrest me?' and he said, 'No.'  I asken him, "Who is going to repair and clean up my house?'  And he said, "If you're going to talk to me, come down to my office.'    "'I can't come down!' I said.  'My doors are broken!'  If I had been on vacation and I didn't have friendly neighbors, I would have lost everything I own.  Here I am a competent, responsible firearms owner, and the government leaves them open, unlocked, with ammo strewn around."    Lawmaster said the agent advised him, "If you want your door to lock and your gun safe to lock, you're gonna' have to pay for it yourself."    "'Oh, I'll come right down, alright,' I told him.  'I'll come down, but I'll bring my attorney.'  And he said, 'Well, you bring your attorney, and we won't talk to you.'"So if you don't want your tea party to be held in awkward silence, makesure your lawyer isn't there, there's a good chap.> It's very sad all those people died, especially the kids, but that's going> to happen in a free society whenever psychologically needy people hook up> with a charismatic nutcase.What a repulsive outlook on society.

The squad wasslowly proceeding up a knoll, away from the body of students.  Some studentswere taunting them, and photographs of the incident show at most one or twostudents who were following and taunting.The series of photographs show the squad slowly proceeding up the hill, whileoccasionally their NCO, .45 in hand turned back to look at where they came from.All at once, as if on command, the entire squad turned and fired their M1Garands, firing 30.06 rounds into the crowd (the NCO can be shown with this45 at full recoil).  At least two of the students shot had nothing to do withthe taunters... they were only passing through, and were not participants inthe confrontation.There is some dispute whether the Guard was even legally on Campus... apparentlythey had not been invited onto the state school by the president, who hadconveniently flown the coop, so as not to be around.  The governor of Ohio,James Rhodes, had just embarked on a senate campaign, and wanted it to be knownthat he was tough on peaceniks, so had ordered the guard in.The matter was quickly covered up.  Some years later, wounded survivors launcheda civil lawsuit against those responsible... a settlement was made, and under theterms, the plaintiffs could not discuss much, and guilty individuals were notidentified (in fact, those shooters in the squad have been identified).It was a tragic incident, but it was not provoked by the students, or apparentlyby General DelCorso or any of his command.  From studying the incident & the photos, IMO it looks like it was an independent action by a small squad of soldiers.

I am as concerned about the media's complicity in thisgrowing coverup.  Can you imagine the media outrage, the lawsuits, theinvestigations that would emit if the government kept the media away fromany other story?  Particularly if a Republican administration had beenbehind it.  What's going on here?Let's look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next.I'm a student of human phychology, particularly in the area of psy-opsbecause I've found some of the techniques to be useful in businessnegotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEURknows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do apsychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI hadprofessionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh's behavior wasemminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away fromcivilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve theirisolation.  It would also be typical, given Koresh's religiousorientation, for such an individual to interpret a government assault asthe apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to beingconsumed in the apocalypse.IMHO, the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentratedpsy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course ofaction designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publiclyappearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered thetanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations.They KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles,obstensibly to perform "gas insertions" (love that NewSpeak) WOULD pushhim over the edge.Look at some supporting evidence.  Koresh's attorney mentioned on TVearlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh's major concern was the biblicalrole of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Renoon Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning)claimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was truethey KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW theywere pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational andreasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, atthe first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back andwould have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the"gas insertion" right up to the point where flames appeared.  The imagethat will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting backand forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.Let's step back and assess how this thing could have been ended withoutbloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agencyinterested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservationof life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.The way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back,abandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed thearmor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploitedhis ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  Asimple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tellhow he whipped the US government would have been something he could nothave resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left thecompound.  Simple, clean and safe but because it would have required theFBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of therevenge they sought, it was totally out of the question.  Not withoutall that testesterone floating around.  After all Jannet Reno had toshow the world how big her balls are.Yesterday was a sad, sad day for the American system.

I waslooking at a Glock .40S&W and the S&W 4006 a couple of weeks ago and thesafties on the guns were very different.  The saftey on the 4006 seemed a lotmore "safe"  (for lack of a better word) than the one on the Glock.  Of coursethis could also be a bad thing if you were to pull the gun on somebody.  Youwould spend more time fiddling around turning the safety off.  Personally Ilike the Glocks because they are very light and I think they look really cool(guess that's why they use them in so many movies) but I wouldn't get one asmy first semi-auto because of the safety.  I would prefer more training witha "traditional" semi-auto (ala Colt .45) but of course that's just my opinion.Jason

I'm just getting started with thistype of activity, so please set your flame-thowers on low.Comments, corrections, suggestions, welcomed.****************************************************************************Editor, I would like to ask you and your readers a few questions that are related tothe "right to keep and bear arms", and to a greater degree, the many other"rights" that we take for granted on a daily basis. 1.You're sleeping at night, when you hear someone in your house.  Youcall the police.  How will you defend yourself, should the need arise, whileyou are waiting for the police to arive? 2.You are driving your family home when your car breaks down.  A "goodsamaritan" stops to "help", when you find you and your family at gun-point orknife-point.  How will you defend yourself?  And your Family? 3.You are a woman walking alone to your car or home.  A man appearssuddenly with the intent to rape you.  How will you defend yourself?  Are youstrong enough to fight off your attacker?  Are you willing to let this man rapeyou in order to survive the attack? If the House and Senate have their way, we will soon not have the right to keepand bear arms, as provided by the Second Amendment to the Constitution. A gunmay not be the answer to each and every dangerous situation, but are you goingto let the politicians decide what sort of force or weapon you may use todefend yourself and your family? Many times a situation may be diffused by just brandishing your handgun.  Ifcertain members of the House and Senate have their way, .25, .32, and 9mmammunition will be banned for sale to anyone other than the military and lawenforcement departments.  Very soon, you may not be able to purchase ammunitionfor use in your handgun. There is already a 15 day waiting period in California.  Do you really feelthat any law abiding citizen should be required to wait this amount of time forthe purchase of a handgun when his life or family members have been threatened?Our local police do an excellent job, but they can not be there all the time,or in a moments notice.  You should have the right to protect yourself   whilewaiting for help to arrive. There is currently legislation circulating in Washington that would prohibitthe sale of certain types of ammuntion, handguns, rifles, and shot-guns.  Oneelected official even wants to repeal the Second Amendment! I want to ask the readers of this paper what they would do if their electedofficials decided that they should only belong to a "certain church", or go tochurch on a "partiular day"?  What if you were told that you could only readcertain books?  Write about certain subjects?  What if you no longer had theright to a jury of your peers?  How about the right to assemble in a peacefulmanner? These are all rights that are provided by our Constitution and the Amendments.If we give up one right, we may as well give them all up.  If you do not fightfor the right to keep and bear arms, what will you fight for?  When your lifeis affected?  Write your law makers now!  Protect all of your rights bydefending your Second Amendment rights.

Ammunition is not as dangerous when simply burned as itis when fired from a gun.  The brass case is not capable of holdingthe pressure generated by burning powder, and will (unless supportedby the walls of a gun barrel or chamber) simply split open.  Whilethis may cause small pieces of brass to fly around, it will notpropel the bullet with any significant velocity.In fact, it was not uncommon in years past to dispose of old loadedcartridges by burning them.  As long as you were not close enoughto take a piece of flying brass in the eye, you were reasonably safe.Thus, the detonation of loaded magazines or loose rounds might causeslight injury but would be unlikely to cause fatal bullet wounds.                               -- Alane --   /-----------------------------------------------------------------\\  /   NOBODY shares my opinions,    |    "I am a jelly doughnut"      \\ /    especially not my employer    |    -- President John F Kennedy   \\/-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\

But some neutrons would also hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactiveswould remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclearwarhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard.As for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintainceis required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage ina dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For privateownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual mustbe able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safecondition.

If you look at the American revolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselvesfrom, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. Theydidn't overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for example) that didn't defend themselves were still under that sameold regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out anddestroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate.But their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren't suitedfor that.There is also the question of personal and collective arms: TheSecond Amendment definately protects ownership of personalweapons (since the very nature of the militia requires membersto provide their own arms.) But it isn't clear if it coversother arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example)a tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively)should. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a disproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower.The militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremelydemocratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only50% would respond to a muster, and the militia's firepower wouldbe proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popularwill were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of themembers supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in theform of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia'sfirepower would depend on the will of a small minority, notof the general public. Worse, that minority would be quitedifferent from the general public (at the very least, theywould be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature andcharacter of the militia requires that each member providea roughly equal share of the militia's firepower: His personalweapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower.

You have chosen a), and discover that the people you defended yourself against are federal agents, who now are camped outside yourdoor waiting for you to surrender.  You have learned that they intend to charge you with murder, and are further defaming your name, while claiming thatyou can safely surrender at any time.  Then they start using psychological warfare techniques against you, while still claiming that you can safely give upand will receive a fair trial.  Some weeks into this standoff, you are stillholding out, when they begin a new ploy to induce your surrender, namely usingtear gas to annoy you, and ramming your home with tanks.  Yet they claim thatyou can safely surrender at any time.  While you patiently wait out this latestround of attacks, your house catches fire and the bales of hay you were using ascover spread the fire rapidly through the house, and you try to escape throughthe fortifications you had raised for your own defense and the rubble createdby the tanks.  Only 9 of your followers make it.I am not claiming that the above scenario is accurate.  I am disagreeing withthe notion that it is their own fault for dying because they refused to surrender to agents of the Federal government after another federal agencycommitted an armed assault of their home on the basis of a flimsily concoctedsearch warrant.  Look at how the Texas Rangers view the BATF.  Look at the FBI statementsregarding the BATF actions.  From all apparent sources, the FBI blunderedtrying to clean up the mess made by the BATF, resulting in an accidental firewhich killed most of the BD's who were still in the compound, and are now playing CYA.  The BATF committed an illegal assault, obtained the use of Texas NG resources with fabricated allegations, and compounded their abusesby accusing the BD's of crimes outside their jurisdiction once they had beenheld off in their assault.-- ********************************************************************************James S.

It would not   be economic to smuggle them in.  All production would have to be   local.  There are not all that many people who have both the skill   AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch.   High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such, but   the average person, and average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun   - and would pay through the nose for it.Good point you make.  However, a zip gun, by definition, is a crude,homemade gun--certainly not something capable of sustained, accuratefire, but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun.  Recallthe tiny, single-shot pistols made by the Allies during World War II foruse by partisans.  They were essentially well-made zipguns, incapable ofeffective fire beyond a few feet.  But they were useful as a means ofkilling German soldiers for their guns.Also note that the crowd-pleasin' favorite, the Sten gun, wasspecifically designed to require as little machine work as possible.The point's been made here that one could make a Sten clone with steeltubing, hand tools and a welder.I still think that while the point is good, I think there's a differencebetween marijuana and firearms, in that quality marijuana can be grownlocally; there's no need to import the stuff.  If guns are banned, Ithink the demand for "real" guns will be sufficient to make smugglingeconomically feasible, thus rendering a ban moot.  In any case, theresult would be the same--people who aren't criminals won't havefirearms, and "bad guys" will continue to have access to them, one wayor another.  And I don't see that as a necessary situation.-- Allan J. Heim   allanh@sco.COM   ...!uunet!sco!allanh   +1 408 427 7813

The DPSwas totally squeezed out of the BD operation and resented being left as"traffic cops".  ATF now has two strikes against them.Finally (I guess that makes three notes), rumour from Waco is that four ATFagents were stopped by four Waco police cars and a DPS trooper after one of theflashed "an automatic weapon" at a cop.

I've just finished reading S414, and have several questions aboutthe Brady bills (S414 and HR1025).1. _Are_ these the current versions of the Brady bill?     What is the status of these bills?  I've heard they're "in committee".     How close is that to being made law?2. S414 and HR1025 seem fairly similar.  Are there any important   differences I missed?3. S414 seems to have some serious loopholes:  A. S414 doesn't specify an "appeals" process to wrongful denial during     the waiting period, other than a civil lawsuit(?)  (S414 has an appeals     process once the required instant background check system is established,     but not before).  B. the police are explicitly NOT liable for mistakes in denying/approving     using existing records (so who would I sue in "A" above to have an     inaccurate record corrected?)  C. S414 includes an exception-to-waiting-period clause for if a person     can convince the local Chief Law-Enforcement Officer (CLEO) of an     immediate threat to his or her life, or life of a household member.     But S414 doesn't say exactly what is considered a "threat", nor does     it place a limit on how long the CLEO takes to issue an exception     statement.True?  Have I misunderstood?  Any other 'holes?4. With just S414, what's to stop a person with a "clean" record from   buying guns, grinding off the serial numbers, and selling them to crooks?   At minimum, what additional laws are needed to prevent this?   'Seems at min. a "gun counting" scheme would be needed   (e.g., "John Doe owns N guns").  So, if S414 passes, I wouldn't be surprised   to see legislation for stricter, harder-to-forge I.D.'s plus national gun   registration, justified by a need to make the Brady bill work.Please comment.  I'm mainly interested in specific problems with the currentlegislation--I don't mean to start a general discussion of the meritsof any/all waiting-period bills ever proposed.MarkS || shepard@netcom.com

The cult's leaders, who claim that God speaks to them, have told cult members to arm themselves in preparation for the end of the world, which they believe to me imminent. Weapons believed to be in their possession include large-bore military weapons as well as sporting arms.  A recent series in nearby newspapers has exposed the plans of the cult to take power throughout the region. Troops have surrounded the cult's "city" after incidents in which officials have exchanged shots with cult members.  There have been reports of children being seen in the cult compound, where discipline is said to be strictly administered. Governor Liliburn Boggs has issued an order that these "Mormons" are to be exterminated, or driven from the state..-----------------------------------------------------------------------And that's the news account, from 150 years ago..> |> We used to live in a country where everyone enjoyed the free exercise of> |> their rights to worship and bear arms.

No one has seen ANY evidence of the BD's having, much less using, such weaponry.

The "abuses" involved were non-mainstream religious beliefs, polygamy, child abuse, and fortification.  Soundfamiliar?  In my opinion, the BD's were as much a real threat to societyas the Mormons were then or are now.  (That is, until they were provoked.)By the way, I find your statement about "non-Nazi" law ironic.  Koresh was suspected of violating the Gun Control Act of 1968, which was BASED ON thetext of the Nazi Weapons Law of March 18, 1938.  ("Gun Control's Nazi Connection;" Jews for Preservation of Firearms Ownership, 2872 S. Wentworth Ave., Milwaukee, WI 53207, (414) 769-0760.)By the way, what was Koresh's specific violation?  FAILURE TO PAY A TAX.That's right -- the BATF are TREASURY agents.

An ATF spokesperson, just before he shot himself, statedthat "this would clean up things once and for all".If the citizens can be gathered into groups of more than 100, the FBI hasindicated they will "burn them, just like we did those kooks in Waco".

Neil Smith                           WEIRD SCIENCEEveryone knows how to tell when a politician is lying:  his lips move.  What may not be equally obvious is that there are politicians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase "political science" is subject to more than one interpretation.  Years ago, we heard how "scientists" were worried that a new Ice Age might be coming, and later on that "nuclear winter" -- smoke and dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international unpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even have killed the dinosaurs.  What we didn't hear was that no actual data supported any of this, that real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended to discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken values that made America the most successful culture in history, and that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague when continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs.  We miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely.  Prince William Sound, site of the famous oil spill, and Mount St. Helen's weren't supposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least 100 years.  That turned out not to be true, although you'd never know it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn't fit their agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and that nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be.  But for once, the media aren't entirely to blame.  As ignorant of science as they are of everything, they trust "scientists" to unscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today's "scientists" have agendas of their own.  Nobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is going to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that there is no respectable evidence for "global warming".  The money and power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and they hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical crisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable.  The same appears true of "acid rain", a deliberate hoax cooked up by the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private industrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and foisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on specialists in different fields not talking to each other much.  The list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread.  "Ozone depletion", for which evidence is even more suspect and contradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than a last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era when state central planning and the command economy have failed and can only find this final, withered leg to teeter on.  Decades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth and panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear power is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy known to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount of energy there is available to any individual in society, the freer that individual -- and his society -- become.  Honest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and self-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as ideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive reductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have been suppressed, most recently by the California state government.  And what the media didn't say about recent EPA "discoveries" on the effect of "secondhand smoking" is that, although some harm to non-smokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of magnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a week or keeping a pet bird.  It's enough to make you wonder whether there was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer.  That, of course, is the real threat represented by politically correct science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice to know the hazards.  I've never believed smoking to be a healthy practice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today's science, how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is highly addictive, to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet the stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There isn't any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of government money on the scientific establishment.  Two centuries ago, the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies to which every other nation in the world has been subject at one time or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and religion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has tried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of abortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street -- has wound up being shed.  Real human blood is being shed over scientific issues, as people's lives are ruined through the loss, to agencies like the EPA, of livelihood, or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate, to diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels for electrical power, or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates, when they die from the effects of obesity.  What we need now, if we hope to survive as a civilization for two more centuries, is another barrier, a Constitutional separation of state and science -- including medicine.  Knowledge is valuable; real science won't languish for lack of funding.  The money will simply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies, and everyone will benefit.  L.

That makes them the best method of defense for the citizenry.Not everybody has the time to train with a gladius, you know, but forsome reason those who prey on others seem to have more free time.  Toextend this a bit further, you need only a certain level of competenceto beat another with a range weapon.  Getting in their face with aweapon and winning is much more difficult, and requires more trainingtime the average citizen just does not have.  I've spent a few yearspracticing with a sword.  I can take the common person armed with one(though self-defense isn't the reason I own one).  My kid sister wouldhave an even chance of beating me, gun vs. gun, with only a month oftraining.

Though quite wrong, let'smake it a blanket statement for weapons in general.  This has beentaken into consideration.

You conqueredyour land (among others) a full millenia before we were thought of, andshortly thereafter weapons weren't quite so common.  I suspect that a fewworld wars made a difference too, since in times of emergency weaponstend to be turned in or donated to needy causes.  I'm curious, though,were the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime, orwere they aquired by other means?

We're too damned violent, partially I believe because we are nota homogeneous culture and don't identify ourselves as "Americans" firstand foremost.  I'm rather proud of my Norwegian and Danish heritage,whereas I suspect you couldn't care less about that 2% Welsh blood inyour veins thanks to a raid in Ireland back in 1055?  The time scaleand the homogeneous culture are important.  Equally important is abasic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good.In America, the individual is more important than the masses.  Personalliberties are prized above all.  This is, sadly, changing of late, butI trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrictindividuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  I'dhazard a guess that, were America less interested in freedom andpersonal liberty and more interested in collective good we never wouldhave sent our armed forces anywhere.  One poor effect of this culturewe have is that we're looking out for ourselves and it is quite easyto identify with only a small segment of the population.  My grandmothertells of being discriminated against back in Denmark because she spoke"low Dane," whereas others spoke "high Dane."  It was shortly afterWorld War II, as I remember, that "low Dane" was abolished so there wasone common dialect.  We cannot fathom such a minor thing being a problem,because we have even more obvious means of identifying an "outsider.">The bad english is not my fault, it's probably>the keyboard-software or the quality of the>subtext on tv......Take heart, yours is better than 90% of what gets posted by native speakers.Any helpful hints for our educational system?

U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodgeasks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire becauseof possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.The testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparentlyended without further incident, as it was mentioned neitherby KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_.The day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley,who had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns personnamed Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting asan informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearmsin his dealings with Randy Weaver.Fadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at anAryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake, Idaho.  The twothen met again October 11, 1989 (note the huge separation intime) at a restaurant in Sandpoint, Idaho, to begin a weaponstransaction.  He stated that Weaver had said, "He felt like he(Weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for theWhite cause."The two later met October 24, 1989 behind the restaurant andlater went to a city park to make the sale.  During this secondmeeting, Fadeley was wearing a small recording device totape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H&R 12-gauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gaugeshotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of24.5 inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrellength and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape, Weaveris reported to have said that he could perform better work oncehis machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibilityof future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollarsfor the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fiftydollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could havesimply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 -over a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained).The next meeting took place on Nov 30, 1989.  Fadeley stated thathis "source" had only come up with one hundred dollars insteadof the one-hundred fifty he'd promised.  At this point, Weaversuspected he was dealing with an informant, "I had a guy inSpokane tell me you were bad."  Fadeley managed to convinceWeaver otherwise.The _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes weremade of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus, each of thesemeetings must have been recorded.  However, the _Statesman_ alsoreported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving VickiWeaver (Randy Weaver's wife) was played to the court.  There musthave also been phone taps.These tapes were played to the court via both headphones andloudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence, Weaver'sattorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted tomake sure that the government proved its case, "...if it has acase at all..." according to the rules.Randy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard hiswife's voice on the tape.U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hearaccounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on theWeaver/Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affectthis trial is not explained.Other notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerningKevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they aresurprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First, they weresurprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustainedin the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later, when RandyWeaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported thatHarris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally, there was a reportthat the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aimingat Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Criticsare charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate theonly non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver andDeputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe thatHarris's survival is simply due to divine intervention.Tuesday, April 20, 1993 will be the sixth day of the trial. Kenneth Fadeley's testimony is scheduled to continue.

WHY?I believe this raid was ill planned because they only had 2 days to plan it,and it was continued when failure was obvious because it had a bit partin the much larger political agenda of President Clinton. I would even suggest that the loss of 4 ATF agents is inconsequential in this thecontext of his political agenda. It MIGHT even be beneficial to his agenda, as it helps point up just how evil these assualt weapons are. Further proofmight be that the ATF denied their agents (Street Stories report) requestsfor sufficient fire power. Important dates: Feb 25th - NJ assembly votes to overturn assault weapon ban.Feb 28th - Compound in Waco attacked.   On Feb. 25th the New Jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weaponban in that state. It looked like it might be a tight vote, but the Senatein N.J. was going to vote to overturn the ban. It would not sit well to havean Eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban, given Clintons statedagenda on gun control. I suspect Clinton gave the order to get someone or somegroup with assualt weapons and have the press present (they were initiallyat the incident in Waco) to record the event for the TV audience. The agent on "Street Stories" reported that a supervisor was urging them all to "get ready fast", as "they know we are coming". I believe this attack continued, even tho the probablility of failure was high,  because it came from the top down. After the N.J. assembly vote, the ATF had a limited amount of time tocome up with something, and the Wackos in Waco fit the bill nicely....rich

I never said that thesealternative means of self-protection involved any hardware.Why are 'good' neighborhoods 'good' ? It isn't because everyperson is armed to the teeth.

'Good' neighborhoods form groupslike 'crime-watch' to increase this effect, and the relativeeffectiveness of the police. When hostiles are arrested, thegood neighbors step up and say "THAT'S the one officer ! Hewas robbing Mr. Jones' house".

DeputyU.S. Marshal Larry Cooper took the stand for the prosecution.The short version is that his testimony was consistent withthe opening statements for the prosecution.Cooper testified that he had arrived in Spokane (Washington)on August 17, 1992 to participate in a surveillance operationwith five other deputies near the Weaver cabin.  The team wasusing night vision equipment for surveillance, and split upinto two teams of three people.  The six later met at anobservation point above the cabin.  After this, deputiesCooper, William Degan, and Arthur Roderick began a descent toscout further possible surveillance sites.Cooper told the court that Roderick threw two large rocks intoa gully to see, "whether the [Weaver family] dogs would respond."Striker, the Weaver's yellow lab, started toward them barkingloudly.  Roderick led the three in a run from the area.They ran through some dense woods into an open area [called the"fern field"] with the dog in pursuit.  By this time, KevinHarris and Samuel Weaver had joined the chase.  The surveillanceteam had reached a Y in the road: Cooper decided that they shouldtake cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easytarget and might be "shot in the back."As Degan reached the Y, he spotted Randy Weaver coming down theroad from the cabin ahead.  Weaver was startled but did not fire.At this moment, Striker reached Degan, and Cooper had to "fendhim off with his gun."  [It is unclear whether this means heclubbed the dog or shot the dog].  Both Cooper and Degan thentook cover in the woods.  According to Cooper, Kevin Harris andSamuel Weaver continued walking down the road, apparently notnoticing the two.  After they had passed by on the road, Degangot up on one knee, raised his gun, and shouted, "Stop!  U.S.Marshal!"  Harris then "...brought the weapon around at hip leveland fired.  He didn't bring the weapon up to eye level.  I sawBill's arm going back, and I knew he had been hit."  Cooper firedat Harris, and Harris went down.  Cooper then brought his weaponto bear on Samuel, but did not fire.  At this point, Cooper thenheard two shots to his right.  Samuel Weaver looked in thedirection of the shots, yelled, "You son of a bitch!" and rantoward them.  Cooper then realized that shots were coming at himfrom directly ahead, so he fired a three-round burst at thecabin.  At this point he then saw Samuel Weaver running towardthe cabin.  When Cooper reached Degan, he placed his first twofingers on Degan carotid artery, counted two or three beats, andthen his heart stopped.  Shortly thereafter, Roderick and theother three marshals joined him.  They then all heard a largeburst of gunfire from the area around the cabin.On cross-examination, David Nevin questioned the point ofthrowing rocks into the gulley, asking, "You wanted to lure thatdog out so you could shoot that dog, didn't you?"  Nevin alsopointed out that in last September's testimony, Cooper hadclaimed that he spotted Weaver after the dog had left him.Cooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head anddecided that Thursday's account was correct.  Nevin continued thecross-examination by asking what Cooper would have done had anarmed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods athim [no answer was available].Friday, April 16 marks continued cross-examination of Cooper.Notes: There was no coverage of protestors.Drew==============================================================-- *************************************************************** Ron Phillips               crphilli@hound.dazixca.ingr.com ** Senior Customer Engineer                                   ** Intergraph Electronics                                     ** 381 East Evelyn Avenue               VOICE: (415) 691-6473 ** Mountain View, CA 94041              FAX:   (415) 691-0350 ***************************************************************

It's wellknown that your local thugs like to target tourists precisely because they are less likely to be carrying than your natives.

I've misplaced theoriginal text, but the story started with one resident calling the cops on a gang member.  Sure enough, a few nights later, there was a drive-by performed at the resident's house.  Except that this time,unlike in LA, the entire street came out and returned fire, puttingan end to the car's occupants.

You seem content to underestimate the electorate; I'm willing totry to raise their consciousness.> Argue away ... you can't win. I think we can.HCI was founded in what, 1980?  In the mid-80's, they ran a "One Million Strong!" campaign for two years before reaching this goal.  My understanding is that they "reached" it by the stratagem of includingwide classes of people other than dues-paying members.  (I can't speakauthoritatively on this -- maybe somebody else has details.)  Then theystarted running a "Two Million Strong!" campaign for a while -- but theylet it slip into unannounced obscurity when it became clear that theysimply were never going to reach that level of membership.In 1964, just after the commencement of the Dodd Hearings -- the startingpoint of the modern gun-control movement, the NRA had a mere 625,000 members.  By 1968, barely after the first murmurs of future registration, it had about a million.  Today, it has over three million members, making it thethird largest membership organization in the country (next to AARP and AAA).And its membership is GROWING FASTER than at any previous time.  (Historicalfigures from Kukla's "Gun Control," pp. 61 and 420.)As you say, many of the people in the middle of this debate are bemusedby their T-bones and MTV.  That leaves hard-core gun-owners against hard-core gun banners.I know a number of ex-HCI members who have recently become NRA members.I've never heard of a single one who has gone the other way.Yes, I think we can and will win this one.> Firearms-related mindless mayhem will be related to the> availibility of firearms.

I now havemy own shotgun in my apartment.  Texas Child Protective Services (which loves to find child abuse) found no,I repeat NO, evidence of abuse when they first looked at the BD, and is sayingthat they see none in any of the kids who were released.  There is no evidencethat Koresh was banging anyone but his wives.  It is not against the law to stockpile (most) weapons or campbell's soup.  Nor is there any hard evidence in the form of actual hardware (as I write this)to prove the BD really had any *proscribed* weapons.  I feel they were all loonies, but there is no indication that they ever bothered anyone.  They were gone after in the wrong ways for the wrong reasons,and the BATF and FBI who are so busy trumpeting this child abuse angle hasn'tgot a leg to stand on or any right to be involved in such abuse cases anyway. If there was any real danger of the BD's going out on a rampage, then thatis up to the officers of the state of Texas, who are probably getting a per-verse bit of pleasure at getting to torque the Feds for fucking up somethingin their state.semper fi,Jammer Jim Miller Texas A&M University '89 and '91________________________________________________________________________________ I don't speak for UH, which is too bad, because they could use the help.

The FBI can manufacture evidence. Need a tape ofKoresh saying, "light the fire", and you can have one. Need a thermalimaging video of three people lighting fires, and through the magic ofcomputer graphics, you can have one. The thing is, manufacturing thesepieces of evidence takes time.

Against civilians that have, at most, one-shot-at-a-timeLIGHT small arms.  Certainly nothing that places the people in or behindthe tank in any real danger.  Molotov coctails?  A round from a rifleor pistol deals with anybody approaching with one of those.  And "snipers"too often turn out to be strays from other cops/guard/army gunfire.I don't know about the other people in this group (or on the net) butthe idea of tanks being used to control civilians, in anything thatpretends to be a free society is outrageous.  When Big Government feelsit is necessary to use that kind of force to stomp out protests (evenviolent) of the citizens, that suggests that the government is totallyout of control, since that is effectively the government declaring waron its own people.  If the government was living up to its responsibility,government of the people BY THE PEOPLE, not the 'lords' and other eliteswho want to keep their good thing going, the citizens wouldn't feel theneed to be resorting to acts that need to be squashed with a militaryboot.  People do things like that because they have become convincedthat it is the only option that remains, other attempts to have grievancesredressed have been ignored.  And yes, there is a criminal element thatwill exploit this, but the fact remains that the government has beenunresponsive or such acts wouldn't be apt to happen.  Still not an excuseto open up on civilians with tanks, heavy machine guns, or whatever.Its the old 'might makes right' philosophy that is the hallmark of agovernment going rogue:  They don't like it? Tough. We will simplysquash them under an iron boot.  Actually addressing their grievancesin other than token fashion with huge volumes of hot air is just tooinconvenient...

One would hear an explosion among manyexplosions.  It is loud, but it is not going to stand out like a 1000pound bomb or a tactical nuke.  There would be a hole blown in the wall,and some rubble, but with tanks knocking over walls, and other sourcesof buildings turning into rubble, and other covering racket such asgunfire, including 50's tacking away, it would not stand out that much,and could be explained by "musta been a gas leak... ".  I think it could bedone and not be reported under such conditions - it is POSSIBLE.  It isnot like a tank driving down a quiet street on a Sunday afternoon, turningand firing, you know.

Butthere would be no _net_ _positive_ effect. You also have to consider the negative side: Law abiding citizens, armed with fireamrs (pistols for the most part), prevent between 80,000(National Crime Survey) and 1,000,000 (Dr. Kleck) crimeseach year. (Those are the extremes. Most studies findthe number to be 500,000 to 600,000.) About 1% of those crimes arehomicides, so private ownership of firearms _saves_ approximately5,000 lives each year. There are roughly 12,000 criminal homicidesand fatal accidents involving guns each year. For there to be any net benefit, you would have to show that gun control measureswould disarm over 40% of the criminals currently using guns.That would be very hard to do: According the the federal BATF,only 8% of criminals buy their guns over the counter. Sincegun control laws, by their very nature, only effect legalsales, such a law would remove all the benefits of armed,law-abiding citizens while having only a minimal effect onarmed criminals (who, by and large, get their guns illegally.) That doesn't sound like a net benefit to me.  >...There were over 250 >accidental< handgun>homicides in America in 1990, most with licensed weapons.Since most were with licensed weapons, I assume you are notsupporting "reasonable" laws (i.e. waiting periods, backgroundchecks, licenses, etc...).

Find another way.You know, in many ways this might be just the kick we need to straightenthings out in this country.  Also, people would have a need to replaceguns with something else, perhaps deadly sprays that would make Mace and OCseem like water.  They would be lighter and easier to conceal.Guns are really "old" in design and as long as we have tons of them, no oneis motivated to design something better.  I'm sure we could come up withsome real nasty stuff if we tried and getting rid of these guns would getus moving on this track asap.  This is what we really want, right?  Stuffthat's smaller, lighter and far more deadly.Remember, in this country we'll really scramble to accomplish impossiblefeats if we are motivated enough and I think "self-defense" is high on ourlist of motivators.

When the BD compound was assaulted by the ATF the BD did fire back.But they agreed to a cease fire and they allowed the ATF to care fortheir wounded.  The BD even released the ATF agents they captured.  Itis clear from the release of the agents and allowing the ATF medicalattention that the BD were not looking for trouble. If the BD were violent they would have held the ATF agents ashostages.  They would not have released them like they did.  If theyhad kept the agents hostage they could have used them as bargeningchips for medical attention etc. A big thing is being made of the BD collection of weapons but no onehas shown that they had any plans to use them.  It is also apparentthat the BD did not have any military training.  If they had, theycould have dug bunkers and trenches and increased theirfortifications.  They could have shot out the lights and speakers.  Itappears that the BD were not violent, they shot back at the attackingATF agents out of panic.  There were shots fired on the last day butthey were in response to the FBI attack on the compound with armor. All the violence in Waco was initiated by the federal agents, not theBD.  --Rod Anderson  N0NZO            | The only acceptable substituteBoulder, CO                    | for brains is silence.rcanders@nyx.cs.du.edu         |       -Solomon Short-satellite  N0NZO on ao-16      |

Sec 552, which was intended to prevent "secret lawmaking" byadministrative bodies.   These practices, amply documented in hearings before this Sub-committee, leave little doubt that the Bureau has disregardedrights guaranteed by the constitution and laws of the UnitedStates.   It has trampled upon the second amendment by chilling exerciseof the right to keep and bear arms by law-abiding citizens.   It has offended the fourth amendment by unreasonably search-ing and seizing private property.   It has ignored the Fifth Amendment by taking private propertywithout just compensation and by entrapping honest citizens with-out regard for their right to due process of law.   The rebuttal presented to the Subcommittee by the Bureau wasutterly unconvincing. Richard Davis, speaking on behalf of theTreasury Department, asserted vaguely that the Bureau's prioritieswere aimed at prosecuting willful violators, particularly felons ille-gally in possession, and at confiscating only guns actually likely tobe used in crime. He also asserted that the Bureau has recentlymade great strides toward achieving these priorities. No documen-tation was offered for either of these assertions. In hearings beforeBATF's Appropriations Subcommittee, however, expert evidencewas submitted establishing that approximately 75 percent of BATFgun prosecutions were aimed at ordinary citizens who had neithercriminal intent nor knowledge, but were enticed by agents intounknowning technical violations.

It has been my experience as chairman of the AppropriationsSubcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government whichfunds ATF, that ATF is one of the most competent and highlyprofessional law enforcement agencies in the Federal government.The agents of ATF have proven their value again and again insuccessful, legal operations to curb the unlawful possession and useof firearms, especially in the area of  drug-related crimes.  Itenforces the Armed Career Criminal Act which calls for mandatoryminimum sentences for repeat felons using firearms to carry out  anillegal activity.  The Bureau has made itself a key component inpreventing gang related violence, also, both by educating at-riskyouth to the dangers of gang membership as well a s by depriving knowngangs from access to weapons. The Waco, Texas case involved the execution of search warrants by ATFon the Branch Davidians for illegal firearms and explosives possession(automatics, semi-automatics, and machine-guns, in addition to bombsand other explosives.)  In virtually every gun case, ATF is asked totrace weapons through its' National Firearms Tracing Center, wherethey keep all dealer and Federal firearms license information.  ATFis the Federal governments' firearms expert and routinely works withstate and local police to execute warrants.  ATF, working with stateand local law enforcement in Texas and the U.S. Attorneys' officefelt it was necessary to execute these warrants in order to legallyestablish that a crime had been committed and conclude a long andthorough investigation of illegal gun and explosives held by membersof the Branch Davidians.  In addition, ATF carefully selected aSunday morning, knowing from their source, inside, that the men wouldbe separated from the women and children and not in the area whereit was known that the illegal weapons were stored. As you may be aware by now, Vernon Howell a.k.a. David Koreshspiritual leader of the Branch Davidians was tipped of the impendingexecution of the search warrants.  Unfortunately, ATF lost theelement of surprise and the cult was able to arm themselves  andprepare for ATFs' entry into the compound.  Once a hostage situationpresented itself, the ATF asked the FBI to become involved since theFBI is skilled in hostage negotiations.  In addition, and militarytanks were brought in due to the serious nature of the situation andfirepower of the Branch Davidians. Based on what I have learned about ATF's role in the Branch Davidianraid, I believe the agency acted responsibly.  I am, however, deeplysaddened by the loss of lives of the 4 law enforcement agents whoattempted to enter the compound and the civilian members of thecult.  I fully expect the Department of  Treasury to conduct athorough evaluation with representatives from law enforcement outsidethe Department to be headed by the Assistant Secretary forEnforcement.  In addition, ATF will conduct its' own review of theWaco operation.  I look forward to reviewing the findings of theevaluators and hope this situation in Waco will be brought to a quickand peaceful conclusion.

I would, reviewing other cases I've seen reportedon in the articles I've read etc.., suggest the safest legal course of actionis as follows. Warn your assailant loudly and in clear tones that you have a weapon(Yes!Even though it's blatantly obvious now that you have it out!)and that you will shoot him if he advances/does not cease whatever hostile action he is currently involved in.( ie: Drop the knife or I'll shoot!)Repeat this process three times,if you can!(not if he's pointing a freakinggun at you himself!That's kinda impractical.) (There are variables here andI will try to address them in turn) After said warning (considering it's ignored) Aim center mass and fire until he drops! This is not sadism, it'spracticality.If he hasn't gone down he's still a threat!(Why I support .45)IF HE TURNS AND RUNS DO NOT PURSUE OR FIRE AT HIS BACK! SHOT'S FIRED IN ANGERWILL BURN YOU LATER! (Though in some cases the I can see where that might notbother me all that much!) If you do drop him! REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE! Have aBystander or witness(Or Create one by yelling at the top of your lungs!)call the police, and wait! Reholster your weapon VISIBLY! Or place it on the ground nearby. Do not attempt to recollect your brass.The police willuse it's location to piece together the scene along with your testimony andthat of any witnesses. Mentally mark witnesses! If the police say that nonecame forward let them know who you saw! Attempt to keep your weapon loadedwith the minimum required(how the hell can I phrase this?) Try to avoid specialpurpose ammunition. Hollow points and Hydrashock rounds give the opposinglawyer the type of loaded phrasing he will need to sawy the jury that youfully intended to kill someone! The only special purpose rounds that I canthink of that would actually help your case (as it has in several) is theGlaser Safety Slug (oh what a lovely name SAFETY SLUG) The stated purposeand stated design parameters of the round are life savers in court.(ie. Attempting to create a bullet which will not overpenetrate, not ricochette, and which is designed to STOP (Not Kill (Gee, to bad the two oftencross, damn I'm real sorry that rapist is dead! NOT!) an assailant withone shot. This, again, can be a real life saver in a hostile court.Be as cooperative with the police as possible! Show them where you were.Repeat your information as often as requested. They will often ask you thesame questions over and over to verify facts, and ,unfortunately, to seeif your lying. Fill out all statements and show all required identificationand weapon permits (BOOO! Down with registered citizens!Register your politicians as deadly tax weapons needing to be confiscated!) If they arerequired in your state. Contact a lawyer immediately if they decide tohold you or that further questioning is needed. If you cannot afford one,contact the NRA.

According> to the Federalist Paper's, a well regulated militia has a well defined > structure and follows nationally uniform regulations.Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!!    James Madison, Federalist Paper 46: "Besides the advantage of    being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost    every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to    which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers    are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of    ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government    of any form can admit of.  Notwithstanding the military    establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are    carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments    are afraid to trust the people with arms."                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434, 8 June 1789: "The right    of the people to keep and bear... arms shall not be infringed.  A    well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people,                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free    country..."    Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (on the organization of    the militia): "Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with    respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it    will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of    a year."    Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (speaking of standing    armies): "... if circumstances should at any time oblige the    government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be    formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large    body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*****    own rights and those of their fellow-citizens."    ***^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^But *surely* Hamilton and Madison didn't mean the PEOPLE when theysaid "people", right?  That's why the Amendment refers to "the Rightof the Militia"?...  ;-)> Your average > 17-45 year old male does not fall into the definition.You're right, the Militia consists of ALL able bodied males (andprobably females under current interpretation). > Therefore most> members of The Militia, the one the every gun advocate refers to, are> not members of a well organized militia and therefore are not directlyThe Amendment does nor refer to "well organized", it says "wellregulated".

That's why the Right is reserved to the People.  And thatwas to insure the People could form a "well regulated Militia", not a"well organized militia".> It could be> argued that the first part of the sentence is separate from the last > part.  If so, why was it include in the same atomic unit of writtenWhat do Atomic Units have to do with this argument?  Any moron can seth_bar = C = 1...> instead of a separate sentence?Oh, I see what your question is; Why don't you read the federalistPapers?!     James Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the "General    Welfare" clause): "Nothing is more natural nor common than first    to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a    recital of particulars."But what does Madison know about the grammatical style of the 2nd?  Heonly wrote it.> The amendment also implies that the right to arms has to due with > the security of a free state.

Blackman, Research Coordinator forNRA-ILA. NRA Official Journal 1/89.-----------------------------------------------------------------------Dear sir:By now, we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine's publicationof small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions aredrawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of momentus "scientific" findings. These are regularly released to the presswithout the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, andoften accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings.Generally, while they at least present a few interesting data, howevermeaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittleserious studies by criminologists.The latest effort -- "Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide:A Tale of Two Cities," by J.H. Sloan, et al., with the accompanying editorial, "Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science," by two employeesof the Centers for Disease Control (November 10), however, is an insultto the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so fewdata and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some lengthto call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particularorder.1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright, et al. (Ref. 1) to support the statement that "some have argued that restrictingaccess to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rateof homicide." Wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected thatcontention.2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are verysimilar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories,demographic characteristics, and the like. In fact, the citiesare very different with very different demographic characteristicswhich appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate inSeattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic whiteand *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to bethe same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back-grounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the variousethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide.3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada's gun law,compared to Washington State's. But they do not examine at allthe situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effectin 1978. As it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975-1977), Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighthinvolving handguns, (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJMarticle there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involvinghandguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes thatone must look to see the prior situation was before concludingthat a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude thata patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each dayfor seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 withoutat least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen?4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a nationalgun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarilyselected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected becauseit was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientificreason. Would physicians call something a scientific study whichinvolved one experimental subject and one dissimilar "control"?Had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite"scientific" conclusions would follow: Vancouver's homiciderate *exceeds* that of such "wild west" cities in Texas asEl Paso, Corpus Christi, Austen, and, in Colorado, ColoradoSprings. (Ref. 3)5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms orhandguns "are far more commonly owned in Seattle than inVancouver." They use two surrogate approaches in pretendingto study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first isan apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carrypermits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns inVancouver. But the number clearly understates the number ofhandguns in Seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgunowners. The second, however, tells nothing about the numberof handguns in Vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handgunsfor the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handgunslegally for protection, registration figures aremeaningless. There are 66,000 registered handguns in New YorkCity (New York Daily News, Sept. 27, 1987). Comparing the two,that method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 populationin New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver, meaning Vancouverhas a greater "prevalence of weapons" than New York City.The second method of measuring gun density is "Cook's gunprevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercitydifferences." But the validation was by Cook of his owntheory. (Ref. 4) Normally, second opinions are sought from adifferent doctor. More significantly, the Cook index isbased on the average of the percentage of firearms involvementin suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically takinga measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide(42% in Seattle, 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse inhomicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in Seattle, 12% inVancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail-ability of firearms, or of handguns, in Seattle andVancouver.6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington andCanada. They neglect to mention the significant fact thatWashington has a waiting period and background check prior tothe purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in Canadianlaw for owning and carrying handguns for personalprotection. The authors also make it appear that it is moredifficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actuallythe case.7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explainthe differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of thepenalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of clearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving afirearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the numberof law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in makingarrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrestrates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentencesimposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns,or gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas socialscientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences,the authors of the NEJM "tale of two cities" fail even to mentionmost factors related to crime control.8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effectivemeans for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is notthe case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection fromcriminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces theliklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will becompleted by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injuryto the victim. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the authorsreported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicideswithout firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattleaccounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicidesinvolving firearms.9. The Centers for Disease Control, which funded the "study,"editorially praised the paper, (Ref. 9) saying it "appliedscientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweebadvocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularlyhandguns." There is nothing in the paper which could possiblybe mistaken for "scientific methods" by a sociologists orcriminologists. The Vancouver-Seattle "study" is the equivolentof testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by findingtwo ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25and the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs,administering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old whilegiving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressureand, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure, announcing in a "special article" a new medical breakthrough.It would be nice to think that such a "study" would neither befunded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM.Since the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDCmake them willing to present shoddy research as "scientificbreakthroughs" in "special articles" and editorials relatingto firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifyingthe news media and those with congressional and executive oversightover the activities of the Centers for Disease Control aboutthe distortions contained in "Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults,and Homicides: A Tale of Two Cities" and "Firearm Injuries: A Callfor Science." Clearly, all scientific standards go by the waysidewhenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seizean opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America.REFERENCES1.

Wright          (from July 1989 issue of REASON, Free Minds & Free Markets)      Someone once wrote: "Statistics are like a bikini.  What they real is   suggestive, but what they conceal is vital."  The problem is demonstrated   by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting   to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by   the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal   of Medicine, the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and   suggested that a handgun ban "may reduce the rate of homicide in a    community."      The nine medical doctors who published "Handgun Regulations, Crime,   Assaults, and Homicide" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite   many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) Vancouver   has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations   make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems   indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period   1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in Vancouver.   Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes,   Why?      The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case   to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning,   that Vancouver's handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their   evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and    unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point   does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support   of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody   knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true.  We   are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that   a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates   when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established.      Indeed, the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two   indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-   weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons   permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the   permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable.*     The second bit of evidence is "Cook's gun prevalence index," which stands*  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook's index*  however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in *  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage*  of homicides and suicides involving firearms.*     In the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides,*  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take*  Cook's index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be*  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides*  is directly related to their relative availability in the general *  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To*  assume what one is seeking to prove, then to "prove" it on the basis of*  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything.      Even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that   guns are less common in Vancouver, we might still question what causes what.   The authors attribute Seattle's higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun   ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates   reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words,   that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa.      In fact, it was once commonly argued that Great Britain's low rate of   violent crime was a function of that nation's strict gun laws and the    consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin    Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime   for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke   an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause.      Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data   on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are "similar in   many ways," implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law   stringency, and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish   the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that "all   else is equal" among things being compared.*     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look *  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime*  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage*  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle*  is about 10 percent black, while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent.*  Vancouver's minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the*  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half-*  dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown*  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out.*     In fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is*  particularly relevant in light of the study's breakdown of homicide rates*  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority, the homicide*  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle, 6.4 in Vancouver.*  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due*  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks,*  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics*  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison*  problematic, but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial*  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle*  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain*  in either city.      Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the   cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority    groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in "gun availability"   (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not   matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why   blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed   in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States, incidentally,   do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.)      Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between   Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have    anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol    abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty's minority population?  (The city   of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the    Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the   United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian   percentage?      The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many   ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent   more detailed analysis, nearly any of these "many ways" might explain part   or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such   as those between Seattle and Vancouver, all else is *not* equal.*     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide*  result in a "complex picture."  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing*  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They*  also acknowledge that "socio-economic status is probably an important*  confounding factor in our comparison," remarking further that "blacks   *  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of*  Vancouver's population."  Given the evidence presented in the article,*  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle*  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle's racial*  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility,*  since "detailed information about household incomes according to race*  is not available for Vancouver."      The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in    gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple   example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms   of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one    would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime.   Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce    crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into   account?  In this example, the "hidden variable" is city size: Guns are   more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city   problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the   appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very   seriously misled.  In the study at hand, the authors matched two cities   for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables,   and their results are impossible to interpret.      In the editorial "Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science" accompanying   the study, two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the   authors for applying "scientific methods" to a problem of grave public   heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from   nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate   plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them   out.  Absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are   little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this   study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical   identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--   is cause for further concern.

(Of course, this wasall set up after the incident started but long before its unhappyconclusion.)  So, yesterday I went to hear him.  What follows is a roughsummary of what I think I heard him say, which should not be taken asexactly what he actually said...Kates started by saying that since he didn't know any more about the firethan the audience did (it had just happened the day before), he would notdiscuss that, but would concentrate on the original raid.Koresh definitely was not playing with a full deck.  But so what?  Thisisn't the first time that the leader of a new, small religious group hasbeen ridiculed by the public.  Extreme religious views nearly always fuelhatred and mistrust.  The first amendment applies, maybe especially, topeople like Koresh.Lengthy digression into the history of police organizations in the US.There were none until about 1830, when they began in metropolitan areas.Police originally were not armed; if they found a crime in progress, theycalled local armed citizens to help.  Many began to carry arms forprotection despite regulations against them, eventually the laws werechanged to allow them to carry guns.  The original intent was to have manysmall police departments, jealous of one another and competitive, but notlarge enough to be a threat to liberty, hence the plethora oforganizations ranging from postal inspectors to the coast guard.  When theFBI was started, agents did not have the authority oto carry guns (theywere to be, after all, a bureau of investigation, not a police force)."All police agencies will be misused by anyone in power to maintain thatpower."The BATF started as a tax collection agency, whose primary job was to raidillegal stills.  When the price of sugar went up so high that moonshinersno longer found their trade no longer profitable, many illegal stillsdisappeared, and the BATF needed something else to do to justify itsexistence, so it turned to activities like phony raids on gun stores.Around the time when the BATF's annual budget is under review, the mediais alerted by the BATF to come to such-and-such a place, where at apre-arranged time, a bunch of cars full of BATF agents roar up to the doorand the media get great pictures of the agents entering the premises of agun dealer suspected of not keeping books properly.  The media isn'tinvited in for the boring hours of agents leafing through paperwork, butif any irregularities are found, the media gets to cover the agentsremoving armfuls of guns from the premises, and the luckless FFL inchains.The Waco incident happened a few weeks before BATF's budget was up forreview.Kates' opinion is that it was a staged publicity stunt that went bad, andthat the BATF never thought for a moment that they would actually be shotat, or they would have planned the raid differently (not sending 100agents over open ground with no cover, for example), and would have hadsome medical personnel on hand.He confirmed that some years ago there was a warrant for Koresh's arrestin connection with a murder charge, and the local sheriff called him onthe phone and explained about it.  Koresh sais, ok, come pick me up, andthe sheriff did, temporarily confiscating all the guns so that they couldbe tested.  Koresh was later cleared, release, and presumably got his gunsback.  At least at that time, he was rational enough to be approachedrationally, and behaved in a reasonable manner.The BATF didn't take into account that, unlike most of the FFL's theyaudit, Koresh was actually paranoid, and fostered paranoia in hisfollowers.  Thus the pubicity stunt looked like a real attack to them, andthey reacted accordingly.With respect to the original warrant, it had not been unsealed when Kateswas giving his talk, so he could not comment on it, except to mention thatthe BATF has been known to not double-check the veractiy of theirinformants, if they can manage to get a judge to issue a warrant.  He hadmore to say about the way the warrant was served, which may have beencompletely illegal.  Apparently the proper way to serve a warrant is toknock on the door and announce that you're an officer with a warrant forthus-and-so; if they don't open the door and the evidence is flushable,then it is ok to break in the door.  But since it is hard to flush gunsdown the toilet, there may have been no justification for the BATFbreaking in the way they did.  If the constitutional rights of theDavidians were violated by an invalid warrant, or by an improperly servedwarrant, then the Davidians may have been justified in their actons.  Aclose look at one of the original films shows that one BATF agent _may_have shot himself by accident when entering the building; if so, this wasthe first shot fired!The role of the media could have been a whole lot worse.  After an initialposition on the side of the BATF, the media began to come around to theview that this might be a situation in which legally armed citizens heldoff a bad, possibly illegal attack.  A real cynic might say that the FBIwent in when they did because it was clear that public opinion wasbeginning to change sides, and the FBI wanted to act before they lost thepublic's sympathy.Should the BATF be abolished?  No.  Police agencies _should_ be numerous,diverse, inefficient, decentralized, etc.  Better a few inept accidentslike this, than a move toward a single, large, well-organized,well-trained, powerful, domestic police force, which would eventually haveeven more tragic results.   - Lyn Bates     (bates@bbn.com)PS Don Kates will be giving a shorter version of this talk at BostonCollege Law School next Tuesday, April 27.  I don't know the exact time orplace, but presumably a phone call to the BC law school could elicit thatinformation.-- Larry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com

The usual practice would be for the governmentto confiscate the children and put them into the "system".  After theyare deprogrammed of course.The government is capable of incredible evils in the name of"Child protection".  Much of the time "Child protection" concernsitself with protecting the child from its natural parents.  Once itsin the "system", the government's concern for the child tends to go to zero. It may not be as bad as Roman behavior, but it could hardlybe described as "kindly"....unless your a believer in the intrinsicgoodness of the government.

Neil Smith                   LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE[AUTHOR'S NOTE:  "Adrian" -- name changed to protect the guilty -- and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with the same editor at a famous New York publishing house.]Dear Adrian:  I'm way behind schedule on my current book again, so this reply to your note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and generally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist mostly of assertions you're free to believe (or not) I can back with evidence and logic I've neither time nor energy to present now.  I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the future.  When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.  There are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger of delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan. 10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition, shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent with your note.  First, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Second, publication of some latter-day "scientific study" doesn't alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.  Third, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Fourth, as often happens with these things, the "study" doesn't support the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions anyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older body of lies, omissions, and distortions.  Fifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Sixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on countless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this present "study" dubious, to say the least.  Seventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Eighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat (not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you should be better aware than most people how "progress" -- in designing "studies" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our ability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30 years to create "studies" "proving" that pornography causes crime.  More naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s clearly indicate the contrary.  Ninth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Tenth, another reason to doubt all such "studies" is that human behavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is fartoo complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.  Eleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Twelfth, the "study" is also worthless because it incorporates figures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but basically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social benefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a criminal offense.  Thirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials quoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are many), are correct in this instance:  the "study" is meaningless because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  And because of that, Adrian, even if the "study" were valid, it wouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however, whenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's permission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists themselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed people to go out and buy their first gun "while they still can".  Before the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the "shooting fraternity" viewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate, ineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in the whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys, and their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we probably manufacture at least that many every year.The fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly aware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what their real motives are.  Look:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way, it's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic; the fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the self-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing this further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a quarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated "half life" of 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna be around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.As for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law provides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I will always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands -- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics and semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.  So what's the point?  L.

This  is most refreshing.Second, I must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days.My brigade's quarterly drill was this weekend and I needed to attendto several matters pertaining to the State Militia.Some people seem to feel that the concept of the Militia is an anachro-nism that is out of place in the 20th century. I'm not sure the Swisswould agree and I think perhaps a discussion of how the Militia, bothorganized and unorganized, fits into the defense plans of my State,Mississippi. Please do not assume that this describes something peculiarto one southern state. For instance, the Commonwealth of Massachusettshas a well organized Militia which, members report, maintains stocksof both riot guns and machine guns. The laws of other States will varybut are probably similar.Title 35  of Mississippi Code defines our Militia as "all able-bodiedcitizens of the state between the ages of seventeen (17) and sixty-two (62) years...". The Militia is divided into 3 classes: The NationalGuard, the Mississippi State Guard and the unorganized Militia.  TheNational Guard is a strange sort of fish from a Constitutional perspective.It tries to be both State Militia and Federal Reserve. The discussionof this "para-constitutional" arrangement is quite interesting in itselfbut somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion. Suffice it that, at thisdate, the National Guard has ceased to have any Constitutional standingas anything but a Federal reserve force.Mississippi, and most other States, maintains a purely State organizedMilitia. In Mississippi this is called The State Guard. In other States it may be called something else. The State Guard exists asa cadre or training corps made up of mostly experienced officers andsenior NCOs who serve as volunteers without compensation. We drillon a monthly basis at the company and battalion level, brigade oncea quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization. OurState-authorized cadre strength is 694. This is a skeleton of anorganization without any flesh. The muscle and sinew when needed willcome from the unorganized Militia.In time of invasion, insurrection or calamity the Governor can orderthe activation of the State Guard. When this takes place a call willfirst be made  for volunteers to fill the organization out to eitherits contingency strength of 2194 or full strength of 4910. In theevent that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer, the lawprovides detailed instructions for the conducting of a draft of theunorganized Militia. The size of the State Guard is not specified bylaw, but rather by executive order. At one time, the organized Militiaof Mississippi consisted of 68 regiments. Needless to say, the Statedoes not have armories brimming with weapons with which to equip sucha force. The historical precedent for arming such a force is by useof mostly the private arms of the Militiamen. It is my hope that demonstrates that State Militias are far from beingthe long dead anachronisms that some may wish to claim.>No, I simple stated that the people have a right to "join a well>organized militia."  And I have also stated that a militia that>meets once or twice a year is clearly "well organized."  And this>state of readiness that I have claimed the people have a "right">to, is the same state of readiness expected of the militia as stated>by Hamilton. Regarding Hamilton: If you take Hamilton's opinion as being the solerepresentative of the opinions of the Founding Fathers, you will havechosen a highly skewed sample set. Hamilton was on the extreme Federalistend of the political spectrum. Others, such as Coxe and Henry, canbe chosen to represent the other end. Many contemporaries felt thatthe idea of having a standing Army of any sort or even a select Militiaor "train bands" were contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern-ment they were striving to perfect. The compromise reached was toprovide for a small Army, which had to be refinanced every two years,and iron-clad protection for the Militia, which was to remain ever,"terrible and irresistible".These protections included: State control, not Federal; limitationof Federal utilization of the Militia (i.e. execute Laws, suppressInsurrections and repel Invasions), and the Right to Keep and BearArms to prevent what the British had tried to do at Lexington.These limitations eventually proved so onerous to the Federal Govern-ment that they were skirted by the creation of the National Guard.The National Guard was created for one very simple reason: the Constitutional Militia was had proved too unreliable for fightingwars of imperial expansion. (e.g. Spanish-American War). TheConstitution provided that the Militia could only be employed bythe Federal government in very limited purposes. As far back as theWar of 1812, Militia units had refused to leave United Statesterritory to attack the enemy. Further, there was no Constitutionalauthorization for any conscription of anyone into the FederalMilitary and Militiamen were particularly protected. In all wars untilWW-I every American who left the country under arms was a volunteer.When the National Guard acts of 1903-1916 required that each newmember also enlist as a reservest in the Army, existing soldiers were"grandfathered". At least one of these "grandfathered" individualsrefused to go to France in 1918 and his refusal was upheld by theFederal Courts.Mr. Rutledge has stated that the Second Amendment applies only tomembers of a "well organized" militia. However, the pre-Constitutionalhistory of the American Militia shows relatively few periods whenThe Militia came close to meeting either Messrs. Rutledge or Hamilton'sdefinition of "well organized". In the period of peace between theFrench & Indian War and The Revolution many companies simply stoppeddrilling and had to be reconstituted just prior to The Revolution.Perhaps Mr. Rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestorswho answered the Lexington alarm had forfeited their rights becausetheir units didn't drill for a few years in the 1760s. I would notbe so bold.Again, I wish to repeat. The National Guard, for all its merits, isnot the Militia described by the Constitution  nor by Mr. Hamiltonnor by Mr. Henry nor by Mr. Coxe. The fact that the Federal Governmentand many States are delinquent in their attentions to and organizingof their Constitutional Militias  diminishes neither theirresponsibilities nor the rights of the Militia as detailed in theConstitution. Misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the Militia is but oneerror that has crept into modern readings of the Constitution. TheConstitution prohibits States from keeping "Troops or Ships of Warin time of Peace". I have heard some insist this prevents States frommaintaining a Militia, but this comes about because people today do notunderstand the meanings of the words in their 18th century usage.Today we call any large vessel a "ship" but in the 18th century the worddescribed a particular kind of vessel.  A "ship" is a large vessel withthree or more masts each carrying square rigged sails. A "brig" has twomasts. In the contemporary usage the States were prohibited only from keepingthe largest warships of the day, those capable of global operations. Today'sequivalent might be a prohibition on the States' keeping nuclear missiles."Troops" at this time meant a full-time professional military organization.Any study of contemporaneous writings will bear this out. In at least one respect, I am in agreement with Mr. Rutledge; beingpersonally involved in the maintenance and advancement of The Militiaas a viable means of defense for a modern society, I am frequentlyboth bemused and saddened when friends and associates wax poetic ontheir place in the unorganized Militia and become strangely silent orscarce when invited to attend a  drill of their State's Militia.-- Donald R.

Ordinary citizens CAN NOT get alicense to carry a concealed weapon.  There are very few people who can.  Ieven asked my lawyer friend about this and he told me that only certain peoplecan get licenses for concealed carry.

But clearlyIt was a "no-knock", according to the Associated Press report.Here's something I found in my collection:    Excerpts from an article in the Knoxville News-Sentinel Final    Edition Monday, March 1, 1993 (the byline is associated press):    WACO, Texas - Fierce gun battles erupted Sunday as more than 100    law officers tried to arrest the leader of a heavily armed    religious cult.  At least four federal agents and two cult members    were reported killed.  [...]    The gun battles began when federal agents hidden in livestock    trailers stormed the sect's head-quarters Sunday morning,             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    witnesses said.  The agents had warrants to search for guns and    explosives and to arrest Howell, said Les Stanford of the ATF in    Washington.  [...]    Witnesses said the law officers stormed the compound's main home,    throwing concussion grenades and screaming "Come out," while three    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    National Guard helicopters approached.  For a moment, there was no    response.  Then the shooting began. I think "storming the sect's head-quaters" and "throwing concussiongrenades" qualifies as a no-knock (or perhaps an illegal assault).> he was not just another guy minding his own business.

Then you can come home to something like this:    "Well, it's been a rough month," begins Johnnie Lawmaster.  "I just get laid off, and my divorce became final.  But I just wasn't ready for what happened this particular Monday."    That particular Monday was was December 16, the first day of the Bill of Rights' third century, the day when federal agents and local law enforcement officer broke into the house in Tulsa that always flew the U.S. flag.  When Lawmaster drove into the driveway that bleak afternoon, one of his neighbors had some news.    "'Ohmigod, John, you are in big trouble!' my neighbor tells me. 'Sixty police, federal agents and the bomb squad busted in you house, kicked down the door, cut locks off your gun safe.'  I couldn't believe it.  Then I walked inside.  What a nightmare."    It was no nightmare; it was horribly real life.  Apparently acting on information the Lawmaster possessed an illegal firearm, some thirty agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) teamed up with state and Tulsa police authorities, search warrant in hand, to search for a "Colt, AR-15, .223 caliber machine gun, unknown serial number."  The warrant, issued by U.S. Magistrate John Leo Wagner, also authorized agents to seize "any tools used in the alteration or modification of firearms, such as files or drills; documents, papers, books, records, and other tangible properties which identify occupants or owners of the property to be searched...."    Reports vary, but according to neighbors, the joint task force operation aimed at the unemployed warehouseman from a nearby hospital involved some 60 agents and local law enforcement personnel against Lawmaster.  They cordoned off the street; took station with weapons drawn in the back yard; used a battering ram to break through the front door; kicked in the back door; broke into his gun safe; threw personal papers around the house; spilled boxes of ammunition on the floor; broke into a small, locked box that contained precious coins; stood on a table to peer through the ceiling tiles, breaking the table in the process.  Then, they left.  The doors were closed but not latched, much less locked.  The ammo and guns were left unsecured.    "My front and back doors were pulled shut, but they were busted through and couldn't latch.  Anybody could have waltzed in there and stolen everything I own.  A child could have taken a gun.  The guns, the safe -- everything was open and laying around.  I keep all my magazines empty, but someone had loaded them.  While I was looking around in amazement, the gas, electric and water companies show up to turn the power off.  They said they were told to shut things down. Then I found the note.  "Nothing Found - ATF."    "They didn't make any attempt to notify me.  I've lived in Tulsa all my life and never got more than a traffic ticket.  How come they can't look that up, realize I've been law-abiding my whole life, then come to the door when I'm home?  They didn't leave someone here to watch over my private property.  They didn't even come by to explain what happened.  They just raided my home, ransaked it, left it wide open and left."    Lawmaster placed a phone call to the local BATF agent.  "I asked, 'Are you gonna' arrest me?' and he said, 'No.'  I asken him, "Who is going to repair and clean up my house?'  And he said, "If you're going to talk to me, come down to my office.'    "'I can't come down!' I said.  'My doors are broken!'  If I had been on vacation and I didn't have friendly neighbors, I would have lost everything I own.  Here I am a competent, responsible firearms owner, and the government leaves them open, unlocked, with ammo strewn around."    Lawmaster said the agent advised him, "If you want your door to lock and your gun safe to lock, you're gonna' have to pay for it yourself."    "'Oh, I'll come right down, alright,' I told him.  'I'll come down, but I'll bring my attorney.'  And he said, 'Well, you bring your attorney, and we won't talk to you.'"So if you don't want your tea party to be held in awkward silence, makesure your lawyer isn't there, there's a good chap.> It's very sad all those people died, especially the kids, but that's going> to happen in a free society whenever psychologically needy people hook up> with a charismatic nutcase.What a repulsive outlook on society.

If|> Jesus did in fact command his disciples to arm themselves, I would|> take that as yet another reason to reject Christian doctrine, for|> whatever it's worth.|> Let me clarify.  In order to more clearly understand scripture, one mustlook in the context of where the verse is found.  The section you referto here is found in Luke 22.  I'd like to start back at verse 35 and I'llinclude it here for the sake of completeness:   Then Jesus asked them, "When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals,   did you lack anything?"   "Nothing." the disciples replied.Verse 36 says:  "But now, if you have a purse take it and also a bag; and    if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.  It is written,    "And he was numbered with the transgressors."Verse 38 says:  The disciples said, "See, Lord, here are two swords."                "That is enough."  he replied.What does this all mean? In verse 35, Jesus points out to the disciples that when he sent them outpreviously, they did not need to take anything with them.  Their food,lodging and transport were often provided through the generosity of others.If verse 36, Jesus alludes to the change in attitude that is to come in thenear future.  Remember, Jesus was saying these things shortly before he wasto be arrested.  In verse 36, He tells the disciples that they will haveto take their own possessions and provisions with them.  THey will have tocarry their own purse because there will be no longer any generosity fromanyone.  And there will be times of peril when they will have to take careof themselves.  This was implied by the reference to the sword.  Jesus knewthat He was going to be arrested and labeled as a criminal.  The chargesbrought against Him were likely to be passed on to his disciples.In verse 38, we see that the disciples have taken Jesus too literally.  It isnot the first time that the disciples got His message wrong.  They had done this on several occassions.  Instead of understanding the gist of His words,they presented Him with two swords.  Jesus was perhaps taken aback bythis promptly concludes the discussion by saying, "That is enough."The disciples could not understand why Jesus had to die.  Jesus kept tellingthem over and over again that He would soon not be with them but they couldnot grasp this.  They wanted their Messiah to be a political leader who wouldlead them in rebellion against the Romans.  That is why they were so keen onpresenting Him with the swords.  They had no idea that Jesus was referring toa different kingdom of which they were to be a part of.  The disciples couldonly perceive of a kingdom on earth rather than the one in Heaven.Understand that Jesus NEVER intended his followers to take up arms in rebellion.This was clearly in evidence in Luke 22:51 when Jesus rebuked his disciples for using the sword against the servant of the high priest when they came to arrest Him.  As further evidence, Jesus goes so far as to heal the man injured by the disciples.  Jesus did NOT condone violence as a means for His purpose.Contrast this behaviour with that of David Koresh and you will clearly see thatDK was NOT Jesus as he claimed.  Jesus surrendered himself to the authouritiesand allowed himself to be crucified.  He didn't go out in a blaze of glory, butrather Jesus was executed like a common criminal.

Since any of these thingsCAN be lethal, you are going to have a hard time explaining why you applied lethal force when you DIDN'T think it was necessary.  (If you thought lethalforce was necessary, you wouldn't be using rubber bullets, would you?) Ouch.

Since the posting I was responding to was on alt.conspiracy,among other crossposted groups, I composed a satiric messageusing jargon sometimes found on that group.  I figured that thecontent (and context) of the message was so absurd that no one wouldtake any part of it completely seriously.If anyone believes that I am an anti-semite, it will be news to myJewish boss and his Israeli wife, both of whom I am on cordial termswith as well as as the many Jews that I have been friends, companions,and co-workers with over the years.  Not to mention, news to me.As far as guns go... I support the Bill of Rights -- all of it -- andif you wish to arm yourself to the teeth, by all means, do so.However, the concept of a .50 calibre machine gun as a sporting weapon(for target practice or otherwise) struck, and continues to strike meas moderately absurd, even if constitutionally protected.To each their own.spl-- Steve Lamont, SciViGuy -- (619) 534-7968 -- spl@szechuan.ucsd.eduSan Diego Microscopy and Imaging Resource/UC San Diego/La Jolla, CA 92093-0608"My other car is a car, too."                 - Bumper strip seen on I-805

But tothink there is a visible and clear chain of command up to the Prez, andthat these agencies inform Reno who informs Clinton, etc. is naive.  Theseagencies operate as distinct and seperate entities and while they haveultimate accountability to the Prez, they make their own moves, and thentell the Prez, who says, "I knew all along".  While this may not seem right,or it may not fit our idealistic need to see a structured chain of commandleading to the White House, thats the way it is.  Bureaucracys are not, afterall, composed of 3 or 4 people who talk on a regular basis, have lunch, andmaybe golf together.  I do agree, the FBI, BATF messed up. I'm not sure ifthey should have stormed the compound or not.  By the way, Jehova Witnessesare a religious minority in this country.  Protestantism is a minorityreligion in the World.  BDs were a cult by all definitions and history ofcults.  To say this is not to persecute a religious or ethnic enclave.Koresh said he was the Messiah.  I was raised a Baptist, although I donot practice the religion and do not think that the Big Guy upstairs isdigging the divisiveness, closemindedness, and right-wing morons that areassociated with the religion.  Anyway, the Messiah that I was taught aboutwould not be carrying a gun, let alone stockpiling weapons.  You can doubtBATF reports all you want, David Koresh was not a poor soul who wasunjustly persecuted.  While some of the information coming from the U.Sgovernment is being exagerated so as keep public opinion on their side, Ido believe that some of the things that former cult members have saidare true.  Anyway, this is just another excuse to try and blame PresidentClinton for something.  People who attempt to do this for political motivesshould be ashamed.  THEY are the ones who are keeping this country fromreaching its full potential.

We should all remember that if Nixonhadn't tried to cover up the misguided actions of some of hissubordinates in the Watergate burglary, the scandal wouldnever have brought down his presidency.  So far, Klinton seemsto be stonewalling this the same way Tricky Dick did.  His wholecase seems to be "we didn't do anything wrong".  However, ifin the course of the investigation it turns out that thegov't DID do something wrong, and he tried to cover it up,then that's an impeachable crime, I believe...

Was it not a state?Yes because it has always had that power. The constitution limits the areasin which the government can exercise power. The constitution can be changedhowever and has been frequently. For example during prohibition the government had no power to permit alcohol to be sold although the state hadthe capacity to change the constitution to enable this.The constitutional provisions are merely a matter of form that dictatethe manner in which power is exercised. No piece of paper can preventabuse, for example the imprisonment of the socialist presidential candidatefor opposing world war I - a clear breach of the first ammendment,The United States clearly has the capacity to bring in meaningful armscontrol measures. If there were large groups of powerful warlords who couldprevent such a measure by force we would have to admit that the powerof the federal government to uphold the constitution was limited. Thisis the situation in Somalia where the state is unable to govern becausethe people with the guns think that they have the right to decide thelaw.|>>You have a very confused notion of what a state is.

But|>saying that "a state is a governing body" does not mean that it is|>the only sort of a governing body, unless one plays semantic games|>like, "if a state didn't create it, it's not really a law".The problem is extrapolating from our notions of what a state is whichdate from the treaty of Westphalia to the medieval period where countrieswere much more analogous to bodies like the EEC or the UN - organisationswhere individual members had significant powers in their own right anddid not derive their power from a central authority.|> The|>canonical example of non-governmental law is probably the Law|>Merchant, which others can expound upon better than I.  But it was|>certainly enforced in non-state courts for some time, although state|>courts, being subsidized, later were able to effectively enter the|>arbitration business.But here we are not talking of a time where law was voluntary. The rulesand regulations settled in this manner were in areas that the state was not involved in. Even today a great deal of law is effectivelymade in this manner. For example the city of London stockmarket which isa non governmental body that can make and enforce rules. It does so howeverwithin the framework laid down by the government.In medieval times this framework existed in preciosely the same manner. Ifyou were to set up shop as a trade association and decide to screw themonarch you could expect to end up inside the tower in a very shorttime. Most of the organisations allowed to make law have explicit RoyalCharters, such as the Universities for example. Fairs and towns all required authority in order to trade. It was customary however for this authorityto be granted on a permanent basis subject to revocation in the case ofmisbehavior. After Magna Carta the monarch lost the power to removeprivillage without recourse to the courts. Tony Benn recently establishedthrough a devious route the power of the Parliament to revoke favourswithout recourse to the courts - thus establishing the right to abolishthe house of lords for example.Certainly none of the rules set up by merchants forms any part of the "common law" which has a very specific meaning in the UK. It is lawmade by the judiciary through judgements on cases. Nothing else iscommon law.Incidentaly the common law is a lot more common than people expect. Forexample a judgment in common law made in England can effect the interpretation of the law in most of the countries that were once inthe Empire, including the US, the reverse is also true. For example alot of the decisions surrounding AIDS cases in the US are of relevanceto UK decisions. Although the statues are different the reasoning thatlies behind the interpretation of those statues is common and thus ifa judge made a reasoned assesment of the interpretation of the law inone jurdisdiction it would clearly be perverse if another country with noguiding precedent should judge a person to be guilty of a crime whichthey might by the existence of a precedent consider to be legal. The lawshould be as predictable as possible and abhors making decisions withoutprecedent. Once a decision is made in the UK though that naturally is superior in UK law.Phill Hallam-Baker.

Where have we heard that before???No, Bill, my full original post included sufficient disclaimers so thatyou could see that I was not claiming that it was a perfect world fromthe Branch Davidians point of view. The point of my article was that itis inappropriate to compare Massada and the fate of the Jewish rebelsto Waco. The Zealot men faced certain execution in a way that wasanathema to their religion, and they knew that their wives and childrenwould be enslaved. American prisons may not be garden spots, but theydon't compare to what the survivors of Massada might have faced. Youindicate that you agree that the Branch Davidians faced a trial. Howdoes that fact alone make for a comparison here?  Even if thegovernment had wanted to find "fall guys" for the BATF deaths, theystill had to prove it to a jury.Once again, my point was quite simple--any comparison between thesituation of the Branch Davidians and the Jews of Massada is absurd.-- ________________________________________Jack F.

Any Messianic pretenderwould tell his followers to get ready for war, since theywere going to throw the Romans out of Judaea and free theIsraelites.For those interested, Bar Kochba's claim was taken far moreseriously than Jesus' among the Jews.  They revolted and600,000 were slaughtered by the Romans.  His claim was onlyrejected after his defeat, although for a short time he lookedas though he would win.  They even got to mint coins beforethe Romans triumphed.Now how that has played into Christianity is rather interestinggiven your use of the statement attributed to Jesus.  Did Koreshfigure he had to get rid of the US government to free Israel?Had he the foggiest notion of who are todays descendants ofthe Israelites?
