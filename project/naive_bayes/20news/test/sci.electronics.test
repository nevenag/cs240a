Iwould like to know which of the pins are inputs, which are outputs,and which are bidirectional (if any - and how the direction isselected).I have found a pinout for the connector:Video Feature Connector Pinouts.Pin     Name   Function1       PD0    Dac Pixel data bit 02       PD1                   bit 13       PD2                   bit 24       PD3                       35       PD4                       46       PD5                       57       PD6                       68       PD7                       79       -      Dac Clock10      -      Dac Blanking11      -      Horizontal Sync12      -      Vertical Sync13      -      Ground14      -      Ground15      -      Ground16      -      Ground17      -      Select Internal Video18      -      Select Internal Sync19      -      Select Internal Dot Clock20      -      Not Used21      -      Ground22      -      Ground23      -      Ground24      -      Ground25      -      Not Used26      -      Not UsedAnd I assume that pins 1 - 12 are outputs, and 17 - 19are inputs. Is this correct?The reason is this - I have a Rombo Media Pro+ videodigitising card. It chroma keys its output into the vgamonitor signal. However, although it is supposed to workwith an ET-4000 with Hi-colour RAMDAC, the colours on screenbehave as if the top 2 bits of colour information are missing,and red, green, blue signals are swapped around.Rombo has suggested that this may be due to insufficientbuffering on the feature connector outputs, and is happy tosell me a buffer device for 50 pounds.I would rather save about 45 pounds, and build my own. I assumeit would require (for example) a 74F244 buffer IC (or two).Can anyone help? Any information on the feature connector wouldbe highly appreciated!Please could you reply by email :ee90dhg@brunel.ac.ukbecause I am at home (easter holidays) and a 300 baud modemis slow for reading news!

The keywords `Monthly Posting'will always appear to make killing this article easy for users ofnewsreaders with kill facilities.  This article is posted to all autosgroups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos.  If you don'tunderstand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or atleast for copies of the newuser documentation.  Failing that, pleasesubscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read thedocumentation provided there.Introduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy:rec.autos.techis intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design,construction, diagnosis, and service.  Other discussions are largelyinappropriate, especially For Sale ads.rec.autos.sportis intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involvingautomobiles.  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they applyto competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints,spectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars arelargely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads areinappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment.Discussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoidadvocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)rec.autos.drivingis intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles.Also, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insertyour pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.rec.autos.vwis intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownershipof automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis,Seats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailinglist was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existenceof this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover manydifferent marques; groups specific to individual marques should only becreated on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such asa mailing list.rec.audio.caris not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however,the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, andso is mentioned here.rec.autos.antiqueis intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 yearsold, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)alt.hotrodis not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to therec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailinglist, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developingperformance vehicles.alt.autos.rod-n-customalso not part of the `official' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiarAmerican hobby of customizing older cars.alt.autos.kartingfor the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.rec.autosis intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.Crossposting:Crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included onthe Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appearin all of the newsgroups listed.Crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities onUsenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article isappropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particularaudience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detectorarticles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They arealmost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the factthat you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics orrec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.Crossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usuallyinappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it istruly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To:to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.Crossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; inparticular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use ofradar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.Most readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn't care less aboutthe police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly inrec.autos.It is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines ofarticles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting tomisc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of thesethree.  The life you save may be your own.Distribution:There is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to(partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distributionfield.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serveas a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.The distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing, the Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia,New Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer thefollowing hints about use of the Distribution: field in your articleheaders, and on article content.1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out FordMavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone ineither place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strangereason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for whichyour car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differencesbetween a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise,all 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuelinjection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  Thesedifferences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear.Failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significantspread of misinformation.3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting;in the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereasEurope is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future editionof this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-usedabbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autosreaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, whenpossible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can(canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter stateabbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wantedto send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put"ny,nj" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separatedvalues are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, soyou should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likelyto be supported in your area.The Dangers of Overgeneralization:To amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article:Be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What istrue for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedlydifferent from those in Idaho.The Need for Adequate Specification:When you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information;e.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year,model, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may bequite useless.Concerning Lemons:At one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon ortwo; even Honda admits to this.  Please don't waste everyone's time byannouncing to the world that your `brand x' automobile is terrible, so all`brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car fromthe `brand x' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because theycause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no usefulinformation.Concerning Flames:As much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that mostlikely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and howto deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next sectionof this posting):If you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for aminute that including the words `No Flames' will work.  It won't, andyou'll get exactly what you deserve.If you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you cancite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believebald, unsupported assertions.Be careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.Asking the Question:It is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Pleasesend email, I don't read this group'.  It is a much better idea toend the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interestI'll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responsesto this request'.Answering the Question:If someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don't tell them to get a Mustang.Either be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice ondefending a speeding ticket, don't tell them to obey the law next time --it's offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn't directlyaddress the original question.  In general, don't post in order to seeyour words in print, and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug andself-righteous.Stale and/or Inflammatory Topics:Certain topics are considered stale by `old timers'; while discussion ofthem is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravingsabout them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts themignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it isdifficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Someof these topics include the following:1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of    radar detectors.3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why    rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car' group -- everyone would argue    about what constitutes a `sports car'.)5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver's    right to own and operate a radar detector6)  `Buy American' discussions7)  `clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?      [when I have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the          commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly.          Until then, please don't waste bandwidth on this topic. -- rpw]Please direct comments and suggestions about this article to:     welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com-- richard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith

The stuff they will stock are the onesthat'll sell, like standard DRAM's, 80386's, 68000's, etc,etc.i.e.  I cna't think of any 'one-stop-shopping' store.The closest you can get is to pick up a copy of Byte magazine orthe Circuit Cellar, Popular Electronics, and the like and flipthrough them.Distributors like Wyle Electronics, Hamilton Avnet, Pioneer Electronics,etc, etc, don't normally deal with end-users like ourselves wherewe only a couple of everything...they only deal with people who buyby the hundreds or more.  Each distributor represents and sells a variety ofdifferent non-competing manufacturers.  What do I mean by this?Suppose ABC Electronics sells Intel 80386's.  It's a pretty goodbet that they won't be selling any of AMD's 386's, or vice-versa.They also can obtain just about *any* chip you want from a manufacturerthey represent.Who knows?  You might be lucky to be able to buy from one of them.But I'd be suprised if you do.  ALso bear in mind that the 1 or 2qty prices they will charge you will be *much* greater than whata mail order outlet will charge.My advice?  If you're gonna be designing anything, try to stickwith off-the-shelf stuff.  You're going to get stuck if you usetoo many esoteric parts sooner or later.good luck,aaron

I built 10 watt FSK transceivers at 904 MHz.  They are essentiallydouble conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 MHz.The receiver uses the MC13055 which is the same FSK receiver chip I usedpreviouslyu in the 2 Mbps 10 GHz data link I first published in HamRadio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook.  The MC3356, which includes a VHF converter section, could also be usedat these speeds.  There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved designof this (the MC13056 if I remember rightly).  While using this would have let me reduce the "external" IF count onreceive, it didn't really offer all that much help on transmit so Ididn't bother with it.  The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2MHz channel but later reduced to half that.  These 256 kbps radiosactually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps andspeed is pretty much a function of filter design.  Handling the datastream is another matter entirely.  Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a"beacon" test mode.  While there is not yet end-end two-way data flowdue to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware (MIOalso shown in the CNC proceedings), data is perfect copy at n6gn.  Eventhough the data clock is currently at about half speed, the a 2+ kbytesof the test text (chapter 55 of Isaiah) takes only a little over 1/8 ofa second.  I've been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step inand get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable (BorlandIDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in theproceedings) but to date a couple of us have been on our own and runninglow on resources of time, money and energy.  If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CWID after the text on the mark side at 904.740 MHz from beacons on SonomaMtn and Black Mtn (overlooking Si valley).  The antenna is horizontallypolarized.  I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costlyapproach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones andyou might want to carefully consider your "target".  If you can'tarrange your paths such that you have complete line-of-sight I thinkyou'll want to address the inter-symbol-interference caused bymultipath and probably link C/N budgets if paths are very far from LOS.For more details, see the 10th CNC.  I'm currently working on a spreadspectrum, direct conversion design to address some of these problems.I'd be glad to help as I can with any design problems.73Glenn Elmore n6gnN6GN @ K3MC      amateur IP:glenn@SantaRosa.ampr.orgInternet:glenne@sr.hp.com

I am using easytrax for doswhich is a great program. But what my question is When laying out traces whatthickness should they be? I am mainly designing low voltage low current boardsfor micro controller apps. What should pad sizes be for resistors? I will beturning to a commercial PCB maker to produce 1's of these boards and I waswondering what is the minimum distance traces should be from each other. Wellany info would be great. Thanks.                                                 Anton

When itdetects a short ring, it turns off your answering machine.Five rings later your fax picks up the call.This should be cheaper and more elegant than the $80switches now available.But that's not what I did.

The best is a 1/2 wave antenna, followed by 1/4, then 1/8 etc.As for SWRing in, what you actually do is trim the antenna to the correct length for the specific wavelength you will be transmitting on. Since the wavelength varies with the channel you use, then it's recommended to SWR in using the middle channel of those you are going to use.Anyway in the beginning of CB's, all new antennas had to be SWR'ed in, nowdays manufactures trim the antennas almost spot on, so that there's not much point in SWRing. Then again you may be a fanatic and whish to do it anyway.Cheers Peter T.

The "near" means thatit is close to the visible spectrum (i.e. of relatively long wavelength),not that it is "nearly UV."  (I'm sure you can figure out now just what"far UV" is.)Regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of UV in thenear end of the spectrum, such that a filter can be used to remove thevisible light and thus create a weak UV source.  Stronger sources aregoing to require gas (probably mercury vapor) discharge tubes (such asfluorescent tubes with UV phosphor).  Be careful, though; strong UVsources can cause physiological damage, especially to the eyes.  Theshorter wavelengths are the most dangerous.It wouldn't project a beam like a flashlight, but replacing the tubesin a portable fluorescent lantern with UV tubes would be a relativelycheap way to create a portable source.  It would be bright enough tobe useful, but not dangerously so.-Ed Halledhall@rand.org

I need it to acceptLINE inputs (tape deck, CD player, etc.) and output to the same! Soinput impedance should equal output impedance.  Also, since I am drivinga line, I would need 1 volt p-p output.  Final requirement is that Ican either:      1. Control it digitallyOR      2. Control it easily, or with few resistorsFINALLY - If anyone knows of any FILTER or EQUALIZER chips, that mightbe useful, please let me know. (I have seen a couple of them from NATIONAL,and MAXIM).

You can get higher end ones for more, but for PA use for bands, I wouldn't bother.Making one yourself might work, but getting a sturdy enough enclosure mightbe hard (they're made of heavy guage metal, since they're always on the floor,being kicked around a lot).

The problem is that lead-acidcells self discharge over time. Even high quality cells (Gates for instance)will discharge 50-60% over a 3-5 month period of time. Non-sealed cellsself discharge even faster. If the battery was not completly chargedwhen left sitting, it probably discharged past the the point where cellsulfiding occurs, which in many cases means a ruined battery.--    /|_|\\   Datalog Consulting, Tucson, AZ  ( . . )  ejm@datalog.com   \\   /   ...!noao!datalog.com!ejm    \\_/

Much easier if you get a DRAMcontroller IC. The MMI 673102 could be used to implement this, or youcould use a counter and a huge multiplexer to provide row/column/refreshaddress multiplexing. The thing with DRAMs is that they require wierdtiming, address multiplexing, and refresh.Actually, if you wanted to use a 68008 IC, you could look at AN897, whichhas a neat controller built in. There is also the 683xx, I think oneof those has the DRAM controller built in. This one is for the 6664DRAM, however, the 41256 has only one more address line, adding onlyanother component or so. The 256k SIMMs are basically 8 or 9 41256DRAM chips (or their equivalent in fewer packages).It *can* be done, just takes a bit of logic design. I'm actuallyabout to do it using a 65C02P3 chip...

I am thinking of using the common method of sending theword through an ADC and then comparing it with the AC voltage (convertedto a sawtooth wave) to get a duty cycle. However, I am leary of thismethod because it a) requires a lot of parts, and, more importantly, b)creates a lot of interference from the switching on the entire AC line. Irealize that correct filtering could cancel out most of this interference,but that would require more parts and boost the price further.Someone mentioned to me that they had seen an IC which input 8bits of data and DIRECTLY scaled the AC voltage coming in all on-chip.Unfortunately, he couldn't remember the chip number or the manufacturer;if anyone else has heard of this chip, please e-mail me.I am building this project as a "dimmer box" for a lightcontroller circuit and it is important that the cost of each box remainsvery low because one dimmer is required for each light that the userwishes to control (well, each channel, at least). Therefor, if each boxcosts $150, I doubt that an end user will want to dish out ($150 x 16 =$2400) for sixteen channels... This is something I have noticed abouttoday's dimmer boxes; they are so expensive!Anyway, any help which someone could offer on either a method ofeasily doing this or info about the chip which will do it for me (alwaysthe preferred method... :) will be greatly appreciated!Michael Carrm-carr@onu.edu

It's not fullyup to date with all the new variations (some of which are just differentmanufacturer's synonyms):------In practical terms, ignoring the technological details, this is my viewof the families (NB I am not a giant corporation, which influences myviews on things like availability and backward compatibility):74The original.  Speed good, power consumption fair.  Effectivelyobsolete now; use 74LS or later, except for a *very* few oddballfunctions like 7407 which are hard to find in newer families.74HModification of 74 for higher speed, at the cost of higherpower consumption.  Very obsolete; use 74F.74LModification of 74 for lower power, at the cost of lower speed.Very obsolete; use CMOS.74SLater modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost inpower consumption.  Effectively obsolete; use 74F.74LSCombination of 74L and 74S, for speed comparable to 74 with lowerpower consumption.  Best all-round TTL now, widest variety ofdevices.74FFast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for highspeed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good.74ASFailed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do thingsthat are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.74ALSPossible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairlynew, availability and prices possibly a problem.74CFairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newerCMOS 74 families.4000(Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOSfamily, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, lowpower consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.Very forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,but that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).There are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  Theclear choice when speed is not important.74HCA new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, powerconsumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice forgeneral-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.CMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range ofsupply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of powerconsumption at faster speeds.74HCT74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Readthe fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibilityin CMOS involves some compromises.10K(Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sourcesclaim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL forserious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and followthe rules or it won't work.  Availability to hobbyists limited,can be expensive.100K(For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, andinconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.As for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devicesyou can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You justhave to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatiblewith the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit ofhassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using.10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.Me?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K areinteresting but I haven't used either significantly yet.-- All work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology                    - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry

The only way to get gain (>1) out of an antenna is to design in directionality. The "gain" of an antenna is defined as the signal increase (for a preferred direction) over the signal obtained by an isotropic antenna.Bob SciamandaEdinboro Univ of PA

I got myfirst one in college about 5 or so years ago.I've been a happy HP user of the DeskWriter for Macintosh forpast 5 years. I got one just a few months after their release. And Igot software revision 1.0a (now I'm up to rev. 3.1. Our family (sisterand father) have each purchased their own DW's after seeing mine gofor one year unscathed (their stuck to their trusty ImageWriter II's).The original DW has gone for 5 years at moderate personal use. I wouldsay that it has gone through at least 15,000 sheets, and around one(small) ink cartridge every 3 months or so.My brother might take this DW now (I'm probably gonna give itto him), and I am looking to upgrade to a color DW. The chiefadvantages/disadvantages I've found over the years are:Advantages:Quick (2-3 ppm), Quiet (roomate can sleep while it'sprinting), AppleTalk Networkable (unfortunately the original wasn't,so look out if you buy used. I rewired our home with phonenetAppleTalk connectors, and while home, we can all use my dad's oneDW!), and cheap (now run ~$300). BTW, you can upgrade older DW's tocolor or for appletalk, I dunno if HP still does the upgrades, but Ireceived many offers (I just didn't ned it however). Also, crisplaser-quality output is a wonder (used to really impress thoseImageWriter Dot-Matrix people so much so, that I had to charge $0.25per sheet to stop my college dorm neighbors from bothering me at allhours of the night....)Disadvantages.Ink used to be hard to find, and wasn't cheap, andwasn't originally water-proof. While HP has done wonders with the ink(I dunno if it's still toxic), it is still subjet to smearing andrunning (if you run around in the damp Boston rain, and get yourbookbag completely soaked). Ink now runs about $14-$15 for small carts(I get mine from Elek-Tek in Chicago, I think they're now down to$12). The ink carts used to say they're dated for only 6 months, butI don't think they say so anymore. We stick to a 4 month supply (ofabout 3 carts). We use cheap Hammerhill Laser Print paper (afterfooling for a long time. Laser/Xerox paper is also good). Smearingdoesn't happen, unless you have a brand new ink cart and you grab thepaper and smudge it all over as soon as it comes out of the machine.Other disadvantages are : No Postscript (this can be an advantage inspeed, usually). Ways around this are Ghostscript or Freedom of Presssoftware solutions. I bet HP probably has a PS prototype inkjet, butthey won't release it for fear of hurting LJ sales.In the end, the primary advantages of laser are true postscript(unless you go for cheap lasers), and fused toner (no smearing, evenwhen soaking in water). Lasers are slightly sharper, but the onlyinstance where I needed precise layouts was Printed Circuit BoardTransparencies for PhotoEtching. I found a Textronix color PhaserPostscript (Thermal Wax Transfer) to work the best to make PCBnegatives directly onto a transparency.Well, hope my babbling has helped.-squish@endor.harvard.edu

The chemical is calledd-Limonene, and it smells like lemon peels (I think it is a lemon extractof some kind).  You might find it in a hardware store, sold as ageneral-purpose solvent, but your best bet would be any bike store --it is used as a chain-cleaning fluid.  It works on sticker glue, crayons,grease, oil, etc.It's clear yellow in the bottle, and you can use it straight; if you addwater, it changes to a creamy consistency, which is good for some jobs.Peter

Do theyneed a lot of power? etc., etc.I'm not too concerned with whether it's long-wave or short-wave(but hey, if anyone has a cheap source of bulbs, I'll take both).One other thing: a friend of mine mentioned something about near-UVlight being cheaper to get at than actual UV light.

He reported that the circuitsworked even tho there were wiring errors. (Can you say ROBUST?)Cadium Sulfide cells vary with light. CMOS or TTL gates provide the SIGMOIDsomewhat-linear-yet-somewhat-limiter transfer function often used. Low power Schottky gates, and earlier gates, has about a gain of X8.LEDs probably output enough light to easily control CdS cells, even at afew mA. And paper with dark and light regions, controlled by pencil anderaser, could also control CdS resistance. The very high input resistance ofCMOS gates may let you charge up 1uF paper/mylar caps to serve as memory.Allen Sullivan

I can imagine whata "mainframe" and "plug-in" are but some things likethe above "storage", "coax input" (Hey, where do I get a probe that fits this? I had to fiddle with mine for a week before I got anything resembling "a good trace" - they allcome with BNC connectors!), "unblanking" (huh?), and, oh,just like my 514 manuals, MANY changes were made along theway to the schematic - scopes, even with IDENTICAL model numbers, have different (better?) response/performance thanothers - how can I pick the better one?

You'll need two for a stereo signal, of course, and a little adapter thingy from Radio Sh#$&^t to convert from RCA to 1/4". Total cost should be around $50. You can also buytransformers for quite a bit less and wire them yourself.

Jurisdictions that ban radar detectors orpolice monitors, are essentially making the claim that there is noother reason for a radar detector or police radio monitor. The results of fighting these claims in courts have been mixed.The federal courts are not anxious to intervene and state courtshave sometimes held that the feds have exclusive jurisdictionand sometimes they have not.  A lot of state courts do not haveenough imagination to see any use for a radar detector besidesavoiding law enforcement action for speeding.When you buy a radar detector, amongst the guarrantees, instructions, explanations, and other detritus, is an invitation to join anassociation dedicated to preserving your right to use a radar detector.(I promise I am not making this up!)I do not think radar detector manufacturers would be making any headway at all in courtrooms if police departments enforced speed laws with a strict eye to public safety and a blind eye to the fundraiser aspect of tickets.

I don't have the book here at work so I can't recall the companyname.  The 6 watter ain't cheap, around $108 but if you want some power,mamamia, that's pretty hot.  They also have a 4 watt, a 2 watt and a1 watt device in their line, and will sell small quan. to individuals.If you are interested, I can find the book at home and get thepertinent info.Now, as for the position detector, you might try ELTEC in Florida.Phone number listed in the 92/93 ETID is 904-253-5328.  They seem like nice people.  Their specialty is passive infrared detection devices,so they might be able to help you out.I'm curious about your applications if you don't mind saying.The device sounds like it could be useful in a lasertag game, although you'dneed to up your carrier signal concept to 58.8 KHz......Duane

This description 1. ignores the role of the ballast, 2. misrepresents the heating effects in the starter.The bimetalic strip cools down immediately after the contactsshort circuit, because the neon discharge stops, and much lessheat is generated from the I^2R loss in the metal as compared tothe neon discharge.The starter contacts open before the tube fires.  Actually,the tube fires as a result of the back-emf generated in the ballastbecause of this immediate opening of the starter's contacts.A capacitor is connected in parallel with the contacts to preventexcessive arcing during the firing.

I asked a professor that question justlast week and he didn't really know himself.  Since pink noise is believedto be due to surface states (say, the surface of the Silicon where there'sa lack of a covalent bond) that act as "traps" to nearby elecrons, and sincethis happens at low frequencies (because at high frequencies they aren'table to "trap" electrons), how do you compensate for that?  It seems to methat you wouldn't be able to compensate for pink noise.  I have seen the"pink noise" feature, however, on many EQs, and I was wonderinghow they are suppose to compensate for noise when pink noise is not due to"man made noise" like power lines, crosstalks, coupling, etc.  If you haveany information about this, it would be appreciated.

In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they meanan "air core resonant transformer". The TV flyback version Teslacoil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 fordiagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called"Oscillating Shuttle Circuit" (OSC). Generally OSC's are highlyefficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors,which are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used activereactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieveefficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-coreresonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMIfor wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computerscreen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coilfrom it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries allTesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputterand die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grindto a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat,gas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, andtelegraph for communication. Is that real world enough for you???????GET THE MESSAGE! WE WOULD NOT HAVE 1/100 THE CONVIENIENCES WE HAVETODAY IF NOT FOR TESLA. GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE!If it had been up to Edison, we'd still be in the 19th century.(flame me at your own peril. I'm very good at putting edison down).---- ET   "Tesla was 100 years ahead of his time. Perhaps now his time comes".----

That's a small cube-shaped device that the user straps aroundthe head similar to a sweat band.  There is a boom that comes fromthe side on which the device is mounted so that it is positionedin front of the user's eye.The Private Eye we had here for evaluation was Hercules-MDAcompatible.  The innards are a row (~400 LEDs) that are swept upand down by a galvonometer-like movement.  The result is that thesweeping LED bar forms a fused raster.  There is a virtual imageprojected in front of the user that the visual system tends to fusewith the background.I didn't like the device very much.  I found it easiest to use if Ilooked at a blank white wall.  I had problems with focus trackingif I glanced down to look at my keyboard for an out-of-the-way key.The unit also emitted a soft buzz and vibration which I foundannoying.

Long term the laserprinter will need some expensive replacement parts (consumables) and on top of that are the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer.HP inkjets understand PCL so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the software package has no inkjet driver. There is one wild difference between the two printers: a laserprinter is a page printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer. This means that a laserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet cannot. Few drivers actually use this facility.(there is also the matter of downloadable fonts and so on)  TC.

The pinlabeled G on the board goes to a zener diode (reference voltage?); thepin labeled T1 goes to the negative lead of a capacitor in the powersupply, and the pin labeled T2 goes to the negative side of the bridgerectifier in the supply.    If anyone can tell me what this is, or better yet, where I can buyone just like it, please email me at ck3i@andrew.cmu.edu.  I've calledNEC's "monitor repair number" and not only do they not know what thepart is, but they don't think that they can find one to sell to me... It makes no sense to me...Thanks

For a while, that is.  Then one channel quit entirely.  I opened it up, and the amplifier chip for the bad channel had simply melted some of its solder joints attaching it to the PCB.  I soldered them back and it worked fine.  I just had to keep the volume a bit lower than I did before.  Probably lousy heat sinking.You said "a nice Alpine" which I'm sure is a few orders of mag higherin quality than the P.O.S. I had.

Chiu knows the score and is just beingsilly. However, "decibel" is in fact 1/10th of a bel. He isright on that one, but I don't know if it was accidental or not.Strictly defined, a bel is the ratio of the log of two power levels,and a decibel is 1/10th of a bel so you have 10X decibels for every bel,hence bel=log(P2/P1) and decibel=10Xlog(P2/P1).The bel, ohm, volt, farad, ampere, watt, hertz, henry, etc. areall named for pioneers in the field. It's a traditional and fineway to honor researchers who discover new knowledge in a new field.Hertz was one of the most important of the early electronics explorers,but had been left out in having a term or unit named after himuntil recently, (1960's, prior to that what is now a hertz was a cps.)All the other units were defined many decades earlier. -- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Actually it is a Goldstar, but it's essentially thesame TV and electronics--just a different face plate and name.#1.  Fortunately, TV tubes don't explode.  I'd think the TV mfrs wantto make this possibility remote as possible.  If at all, they'll *implode* and the glass that blows out would be the result of theglass boucing off the back of the tube due to the implosion. In anycase, don't kick it around! :-) #2  I fixed the TV after getting a hold of some schematics.  It turnedout to be a blown 2W resistor feeding the flyback transformer.  I guessthe original resistor was a bit too small to dissipate the heat itcreated, burning itself out.  I checked to make sure the flyback wasn'tshorted or anything first!  Oh, luckily, I had a resistor handy lyingaround that had just the right value for what I needed.  I can't see itbeing more than 50 cents!.Well, needless to say, the TV still works today.  So go get a set ofschematics and have some fun...just don't get shocked poking aroundthe flyback.

Withrow Associates, 21 Railroad Ave, Swampscott MA 01907-1821 USAFor those who are interested, the FCC does indeed care about cableleakage, particularly into the aviation nav band, or leakage thatis "causing interference to other services".Part 76.611 details specific limits to acceptable leakage, andmeasurement technique.  If you will clearly document your problem,and measurement technique (a signal level meter with dipole is thenormal approach, remember to correct between measurement data andmicrovolts per meter) and fax or mail the details to Mr. John WongCable Branch, FCC 1919 M st. NW Wash DC, and a copy of your letterto the local cable company, you will get results.  In fact the cablecompany will probably start treating you much better when they realizeyou have figured out how to get the FCCs attention.What is important is to document your case as it relates to theapplicable rules.  However the cable company *is required* toat least check out every complaint of leakage.  They must filewith the commission and maintain on premises a yearly measurementreport that details the results of leakage testing.But remember, call the cable company first, and give them achance to work to correct the problem before contactingthe commission.I am in the business of measuring cable system leakage viathe airborne method.-- SCOTTCR@WKUVX1.BITNET aka Chris Scott-                  Telco: (502) 745-3834

(I am almostsure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms, but I may bewrong.  Oh well, I don't have a corroded battery to corrobate, and I don't feellike thinking through it right now.) What is important to notice here is that the reaction, as you knew it would be,is exothermic, or energy discharging.  If moisture with dissolved electrolytes(acid rain) condenses on the battery, a conductive path between the terminalsmay form.  This will discharge the battery as the chemical reaction proceeds.The reaction is reversible, if electricity (from an alternator or batterycharger) is put back into the battery. Lead-acid batteries must change in chemical composition to discharge.  Eachcell has all the reactants necessary for the reaction.  The non-reacting posts(terminals) of the lead-acid battery are there to remove (or add) electricenergy during a discharge (or charge).  Because the reaction is exothermic, ithas a tendency to happen, though quite slowly under normal circumstances.  Sowhile keeping the battery dry is a good idea, it is not a total solution. To understand why lead-acid batteries DO INDEED discharge faster when stored onconcrete as opposed to wood or earth (dirt), one should recall LeChatelier'sPrinciple, which can be paraphrased as:  anything subjected to some stress willact to move to a more comfortable position.  Here are the thermal conductivitiesof a some selected materials:                                               thermal conductivity       material           Temperature, C (F)  BTU/(hr-ft-ft)(F/ft)       --------           ------------------  --------------------diatomaceous earth,            204                   0.051 natural, across strata        871                   0.077diatomaceous, natural,         204                   0.081 parallel to strata            871                   0.106diatomaceous earth powder     (100)                  0.039  (density, 18 lb/cu.ft)      (200)                  0.042                              (300)                  0.044                              (400)                  0.048                              (500)                  0.051concrete (cinder)              ---                   0.20         (stone)               ---                   0.54         (1:4 dry)             ---                   0.44pine (across grain)             15                   0.087   (parallel to grain)          21                   0.20oak (across grain)              15                   0.12maple (across grain)            50                   0.11 Note that the thermal conductivity for "dirt" (diatomaceous earth) goes downwith temperature.  Also, 204 C is about 400 K, and the values for earth powderare on the same order of magnitude as natural earth.  The thermal conductivityof concrete is around a factor of 10 greater than that of dirt, and is 2-4times greater than wood. It is these differences in thermal conductivity that cause the battery onconcrete to discharge faster than that on dirt or wood.  At any instant thedischarge reaction is occurring, energy is being released, either as electricityor heat.  (Thermal conductivity of air is about 0.015 BTU/(hr-ft-ft)(F/ft).)During storage, except for the trickle that passes through any condensate onthe battery, this energy is mostly released as heat.  The higher conductivitysurface will remove the heat proportionately faster than the lower conductivitysurface.  Thus, if you perfectly insulated a dry battery on all but the bottomsurface, at any given battery temperature above the storage surface temperature,the battery on a concrete surface will be discharging about 10 times fasterthan that on dirt. This is where LeChatelier's principle comes into play.  Removing energy fromthe exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion.  If thereaction normally occurs at room temperature, keeping the battery at thattemperature requires the removal of any heat produced.  A concrete surface isa better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface.  Store a battery in the cornerof a poured concrete basement, and you have 3 surfaces removing energy, which"pulls" the reaction along. Also, if water evaporates from the battery, that elevates the ratio of sulfuricacid to water.  This will tend to drive the discharge reaction.

That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistorhere to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for thecurrent shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowingand the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open,this resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of thestrings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.  Or use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can getone.  Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as thesedraw too much current and burn out the blinker.  C9 = approx 7W.What you'll see when it's working:  powerup, string 1 will light at full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current from the second string, making them not light.  b will open, placing both strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a low brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow at reduced brightness. Be sure to wire and insulate the splices, resistor leads, and cut wires in a safe manner!

I hear that they're called>'Cooling Towers' but what the heck do they cool?Except for their size, the cooling towers on nuclear power plantsare vertually identical in construction and operation to coolingtowers designed and built in the 1890's (a hundred years ago) forcoal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric railways.Basicly, the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft whenits air is heated by hot water and/or steam circulating thru a networkof pipes that fill about the lower 1/3 of the tower. To assist coolingand the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over thehot pipes. The cold water evaporates, removing the heat faster thanjust air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor israpidly carried away by the draft. This produces the clouds frequentlyseen rising out of these towers.That slight pinch (maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower) is there becauseit produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate ofthe air draft produced, compared to a straight cylinder shape.The towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steamsystem of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to theboiler and used again. The wider the temperature difference acrossthe turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are andby recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending itback to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference(sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage "hot"turbine to final stage "cold" turbine).

Anyone else think so?Back in the 70's I was a service technician for a cash register company.The cash registers used microprocessor circuits and back then they wereVERY susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise.  The biggestproblems came from outlets that were not properly grounded.In almost every place we went to do an installation, we found outletswith the ground connected to the neutral.  For 99.9% of the things youcan plug into one of these, they work fine.  For our cash registers theywere a nightmare -- line noise tended to scramble the memoryperiodically.With modern electronics using switching power supplies this should beless of a problem.  Even the company I used to work for is no longerrecommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for theirequipment.  I imagine if you check MOST household wiring you will findthat the ground and neutral are connected.  Although not ideal, itshould be o.k. for most applications.--- . SLMR 2.1 .

At this current the duty cycle of the LED drops to 10% and Iwould need to cycle five of them in turn to get the 50% required.Has anyone done something like this?Stan Burton (DND/CRAD/DRES/DTD/MSS/AGCG)                 sburton@dres.dnd.ca(403) 544-4737     DRE Suffield, Box 4000, Medicine Hat, AB, Canada, T1A 8K6

With the DeskJet>Portable, you even get an undocumented PCMCIA card slot!I second that suggestion.  Although I don't own the HP Portable Deskjet,I *do* own the HP Deskjet 500.  It gives the nicest outputs, with onlya minor loss of quality.   For all intensive purposes (papers, letters,resumes), I treat my Deskjet like a laser printer (You *do* have tolook a bit closely to see the blurs in the characters).  Only onegrudge, the ink that HP gives you does smudge rather quickly in thepresence of moisture (Even though the ink is waterproof).  However,you would have to spend about $500 more for laser quality.The cannon bubblejets are nice, however they don't seem to have asmuch support (eg: drivers for popular programs) as the HP ink-jets.Also HP Deskjet (regular,plus,500,500c) accepts xerox paper (I believethat the cut-sheet feeder is an option for the cannon bubblejet).If you don't mind refilling your printer with cheap ink (sayfountain-pen ink), then the HP deskjets are *very* cheap to maintain(I paid $3.50 for my last bottle of ink and I expect it to last 9months). -Kimball (who doesn't work for HP, but just loves his printer  very much!)PS: I have a question for you netters, I'm too afraid to refill withthe waterproof inks they sell in art-supply houses because I had broughta bottle of waterproof ink and it clogged up my cartridge. Iwonder what is a 'good' waterproof ink (aside from buying refill-kits)to refill my cartridge?

If neither the output orinput presents an unintentional DC level (let's say they're capacitivelycoupled), then putting a 22 K resistor from each input to ground, andfrom the output to ground is a good precaution against leakage in anycoupling caps presenting a DC level that is GUARANTEED to cause a click.If the device presents an unintentional DC level that is from more thanjust coupling capacitor leakage, then you need to remove the DC beforeswitching with coupling capacitors of your own.If you have more than one relay (each relay switching one inputthrough to a common output), you can use make-before-break switchingwhere for a brief instant both sources are connected during a switchchange. This may mask the switch click.An audio switch that is clickless is made by taking a light bulb andmaking your own ersatz opto-isolator with a light-dependent resistor (LDR)sealed inside a piece of black heatshrink. Many broadcast consolesuse this older, but time-honored technique. Claro actually makesa complete optisolator like this, but I don't have a part number handy.Radio Shack has a LDR grab-bag (276-1657) you might want to try.For a simple, solid state clickless switch that is cheap, you might try looking at the CD4066 analog switch that is commonly available (or itsolder predecessor, the 4016). Again, the DC component must be removedprior to switching. Other alternatives include JFET switches (both discreteand IC) and diode switching (which works relatively well, surprisingly).All the above, with their pitfalls and application tips could easilymake a subject for a multi-page article.Solid state switches may induce a click of their own when turned ondue to charge being injected into the audio line through devicecapacitance when the control signal changes state. Techniques tominimize this include lowering the impedance of the signal paths throughthe switch, differential switching, and slowing the risetime of thecontrol pulse. With the 4016, cutting the click can be as simple asputting 10K - 47K resistors in series with the control pins.Hope this helps at least get you started.-- --------------------------------------------------------------------       Dave MedinPhone:(205) 730-3169 (w)    SSD--Networking(205) 837-1174 (h)    Intergraph Corp.

Well, tune in 10.7Mhz or 455Khz.  These numbers sound like some you have herd before?   Thats right, you guessed it, they are common IF numbers.   Every Super-Het receiver has a local oscillator(s)which generates an IF.  This is what your detector detector is detecting (thelocal oscillator). Some of these have two or more local oscillator which generate more ways toreceiver you.  If you want to receiver something at say 10.525Ghz you must generate a local oscillator signal of 10.525Ghz - 10.7Mhz = your local oscfrequency.  This 10.7Mhz IF is then fed into a normal AGC ckt.  The detector is keyed uppon the AGC voltage (your mileage may vary).  Sincethe AGC is a negative feed back device, a positive voltage sets off a ...I think you get the picture.

Sounds like a very cool program.Tis' only a gleam in my eye at this point.  I have yet to chose a tracking method.  The initial requirement was to design a system to locate a dancerin one of eight zones across the stage.  I did some experiments with pyroelectric detectors and found them difficult to align to get a definitezone transition.  And dancers stand still alot, so their IR signature goesaway.  The good thing about pryoelectrics is that their signal is proportional to the size of the warm body (or body part), and the velocity of said body.This could be useful for detecting the intensity of a dance gesture.Dancers also really hate to wear little boxes and batteries strapped on their bodies, but they really need to be emitting some kind of signal to be tracked.The current toy I have been working with is a program called Mandala for theAmiga, used with a LIVE! video digitizer.  This works with a video camera trained on the stage.  You can set thresholds for a zone within the field ofview, and an object brighter than the threshold will trigger an event. Eventscan be MIDI objects or sequences, Amiga sounds or graphic objects.  It's beenfun to play with, but the documentaion is arcane, and the digitizer is noisy.Still, it's very appealing, the dancers don't have to wear any appliances,you can have ots of zone,s, it speaks MIDI, which can be used to control lights,and I don't have to build any electronics.  It's all done with lighting andvideo brightness and contrast adjustments.  I have yet to do anythingparticularly useful or artistic, but I have hopes...

Atnuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle, whereasfossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hotwater.  As I recall the water isn't as hot (thermodynamically) in manyfossil fuel plants, and of course there is less danger of radioactivecontamination.Wayne Martin

The line service guys use thisto make sure they connect up the right pairs of lines.

(i tried changing the remote'sbatteries) when i try a remote function - the receiver registers that itreceived it (a green remote light flashes) but the right functiondoesn't happen - if any function at all.  (also strange- when i hit the "mute" button, for example, the display panel goes black - yikes-i've never seen that before ...)- before all the strangeness started, the system turned itself OFF and ONagain - by itself- sometimes it won't play a radio station, so i have to kinda twist it (yes kinda flex the motherboard, chasis) for it to get the radiotuning back - the aux in function always works however....it is inconvenient, but NOT inconvenient enough to pay an expensive repair fee.  while, i'm not a hardware guy, i wonder if something as simple as a surge supressor will be a quick fix.the strange thing is that these symptoms come and go ...someone told me this unit series has a bad Voltage Amp chip.-anyway  ...arghh-cjk

They cost ~$1 at Radio Shack (much cheaper inquantity at quality places), and you will be able to find good infoabout simple circuits in a 555 oscialltor notebook (I think ForestMims has one at Radio Shack). You'll have to toy withresistor/capacitor values OR you can use your head with a little mathto get the right frequencies. Any engineer worth his salt, can make a555 osciallator... It's in the book, and left up to you to see (I hatedoing ASCII circuit graphics). The 555 can accurately go from a few Hzto about 500 KHz (I think).About the Tape Recorder gizmo, you could alter a stereo tape deck touse one channel as a DATA line (for flashing LED), and one as audioline (for voice or music). This would eliminate a lot of noise.The data line is probably most easily doneby some kind of PLL or bandpass filter (using just an op-amp). The 565chip is a good PLL, and not hard to work with. However if you nothingabout how a PLL works, I suggest you don't try this. Op-Ampinformation can also be found in the Forest Mims Radio Shackinfo-booklets, and the popular 741 op-amp is a snap to work with.Setting frequency and bandpass filter values are not so easy, so Iwould suggest the 555 method firstmost... I have no idea what this isgoing into, so I am really generalizing...As for manufacturing techniques, if you're only goofing with it, Isuggest you breadboard the thing... No need to solder. Wire-wrap wouldbe the next, more permanent step. And lastly, soldering/PCB making.Hope that clears things......-squish@endor.harvard.edu

Tip is the GREEN wire of most standardphone lines. They two constitute the two wires most often used forvoice telephone (the two live lines). They are the two innermostconnectors of an RJ-11 phone jack.Another way of telling is that if you measure voltage from RED toGREEN (ring to tip. tip/green being at ground potential of thevoltmeter), it should read -48 volts in the on-hook no-ring position).I am 98% sure it's -48 V and not +48 volts. Doesn't hurt a phone toomuch if they're reversed, it's just bad if one happens to somehow getgrounded to earth ground elsewhere).Additionally, when off-hook, the voltage drops to about -4 to -9 VoltsDC. I think it is supposed to correspond to a 36 to 40 mA currentloop. And lastly, when ringing, the two wires develop an AC potentialof about 80 V p-p at 20 to 30 Hz across them (where you get theelectromechanical old fashioned bell ringer from).Hope that clears things...-squish@endor.harvard.edu

Now while I thinkI understand what oversampling is (the rate of discrete "samples"exceeds the highest frequency component of interest by some factor),I don't understand this "8 TIMES" business...  It seems to me that whenI bought my first CD player (was it REALLY 10 years ago?!), the specssaid "4 TIMES" ...  Could someone please tell me whether I'm gettingsenile?  If I'm not, then what good does it do for the player to takesamples at a higher rate?  If I really wanted better fidelity, wouldn'tI have to have the same higher rate of sampling during the recordingprocess?  Furthermore, am I wrong in interpreting the sampling rate(from the player's point of view) as being the same thing as the datarate for the bit stream coming off the optical medium?  Does this meanthat the data rate (related to the rotational speed of the disk) has changed since 1983?I'm so confused...  --Cliff-- | Clifford Bowman, Box 1890, Russellville, AR  72811 | hcb@netcom.com || I'm pretty sure the world *isn't* fair...

Ultra-violet (by definition?) goes from the blue end of thespectrum that people see to the radio spectrum (X-rays, cosmic rays etc).possibly you could get light at the fringe of visibility (which peoplewith false eye-lenses can see easily, since it's your lenses that soak upmost of the UV), however since most people use UV to get other thingsto `glow', and the near-blue is less energetic, it would probably notwork as well, if it worked at all.

The electronics and dynamics of the inkcartridge, however, limit you to generating dots at 300 per inch.On almost any paper, the ink wicks more than 1/300th inch anyway.The method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printerresults in much less spread than ink drop technology.It doesn't take much investigation to see that the mechanical andelectronic complement of a laser printer is more complex thaninexpensive ink jet printers.  Recall also that laser printersoffer a much higher throughput:  10 ppm for a laser versus about 1ppm for an ink jet printer.Something else to think about is the cost of consumables over thelife of the printer.  A 3000 page yield toner cartridge is about$US 75-80 at discount while HP high capacity (~500-1000 page yield)cartridges are about $US 22 at discount.

The material used to make them goes by twonames.  If it is used to make circuit boards it is called FR-4.  The samematerial is used in the cryogenics industrya and marine industries as astructural material and is called G-10.  FR-4 and G-10 are both green.  Theyare not green because of a solder masking agent.  The basic ingredients area clear epoxy resin and glass fibers.  I am not sure what the specs are onthe resin, but if you are really curious you can call NEMA (NationalElectronics Manufacturing Association) or Ciba Geigy (a major manufacturerof epoxy resins) to find out.  As an aside, I occasionally mix clear epoxyand glass microsphres to cast small structures for cryogenics experiments.The proportions of glass to epoxy are about the same as in G-10.  They arethe same green color.

What frequency is used for>the land-based beacons?>Thanks in advance,>Charlie Thompson>.Here's a rough sketch of how the system works.  A reference stationwith a very exactly known position computes the errors in theincoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factorsincluding atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) timedithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational equipment to "back out" the errors in its position (since it knowswhere it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a broadcast which is available to any number of relatively localreceivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are usingthe same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be verysimilar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, thereceiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the referenceunit.The US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a seriesof coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations willuse existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signalson different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offerscorrection signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast systemwhich has stations all across the US.The correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format.Advertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.-------------------------------------------------------------------------John P.

When this happens the liquid uranium is pumped to the coolingtower where it is sprayed into the air. Contact with the cool outside airwill condense the mist and it will fall back to the cooling tower floor.There it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is thenreformed into pellets for reactor use the next day.Cooling towers are a lot taller than they really need to be. Power companiesare forced to make them that tall by some enviromental law that requires theraw uranium emisions to be held to under 1%. This law is now under attackby lawyers arguing that the 1% should be measured at the edge of the propertyrather than the edge of the cooling tower. Eliminating this law will savepower companies thousands of dollars in concrete costs for new nukes.John Eaton!hp-vcd!johne

I wouldlike to know if another manufacturer produces one which may be easier toimplement in my circuit.BTW, if anyone is wanting to hook up DRAM to a microcontroller, DallasSemiconductor makes a neat chip: the DS1262 Serial DRAM NonvolatizerChip.  It uses the SPI (I2C) bus and refreshes/controls up to 16Mx1 of DRAMmemory.  It can use an external battery to refresh the DRAM when thepower is off.  Price is $11.75 from Dallas (quan 1).

I suppose you could linearize it in software, but the real problemis that the precision of your measurement is no longer constant (highervoltages would be more precise).On the other hand, I could be wrong and perhaps the game card designerssplurged for the extra $.50 to make a cheap constant current source out ofan op amp.  But I wouldn't expect that...---Joel Kolstad

In order to get the brick -wall, you need enough voltage gain on the current sensor.  Normally a darlington on the current sensing resistor will be adequate, but for infinite gain.. use an op amp to sense the current releative to a stable voltage reference and use a driver to turn off the base bias on the series-pass transistor.

This approach is the easiest and cleanest way toswitchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since,as you mentioned, nothing will know about what happened down the line.Another way to do the UPS scheme is to use the mains until youlose power, and then kick in the battery backup with it's inverter toreplace the lost power.  The problem here is the switchover time andyou've got to resync the AC in no time flat.Unfortunately, most everything is built around the assumption thatAC is available, so the UPS guys have to provide and AC output tobe usable...ya sorta have to make it work with what there already.Similar story with our telephone system.

In storage,either the electrolyte should be removed and replaced for use (fat chanceI'd ever do that at home), or the battery should be stored on a tricklecharge.  I have also (I think) read that the condition may be reversableif hooked up to a current limited charging circuit fro a LONG period of time.The refernce I remember is to use C/50 (where C is the amp hours) as thecharging circuit, and leave it hooked up for weeks.

The ground issupposed to be a protective ground, and though what you suggestlooks good on paper, it's dangerous to rely on the same wire forpower and protection.  It'd never meet code, and if you now ownthe property and later sell it, you may end up with liabilitiesyou don't want, and if you _don't_ now own it, well...There's a "wiring" FAQ that I think addresses this.  I believean alternative is use of a GFCI, but I'm really not sure whatcurrent code allows in this area.  The GFCI senses alternate(unwanted) current paths, and doesn't rely on a specificprotective ground wire, at least not beyond the GFCI in theprotected circuit.

Keep traces short and use separatesensing traces where appropriate, as mentioned by another poster.)

As the load resistance increases, the RC constant decreasesand hence the output voltage drops. I need as high an outputvoltage as possible. (about 260v).  The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages(ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38vacross them, and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v.  Each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v. If I increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that willincrease the RC constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem.These capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need 14 ofthem, So:1. What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel with the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)?  Will it, as I assume, increase the C in circuit and hence increasethe RC time constant? If it does, and my output voltage becomes morestable by doing this, then I will have killed two birds with one stone...as I am experiencing some 50Hz ripple (and hence amp hum), and this newcapacitor will 'smooth' this out.and2. Can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor (choke) tobe placed in the output line of the power supply to filter outthe 50Hz mains hum. Lowest resistance possible !

I have a metex which is some made up name, as I have seen the same DMM with other brand names on it, I bought it about 4 yrs ago for Aus$125.00 (convert that to US and you see that it's definetly a cheapie.) So far it has proved to be accurate, taken moderate abuse, and has many features on it (CAP, FREQ,Transistor check, etc). I am very happy with it and would definetly not buy a fluke just for the name. Hope this helps.Cheers Peter T.

To get an image on the screen, you had to waituntil the raster line your picture started at, load bitmaps for this lineinto the 'sprite' registers, tell them what x positions to take, how manyduplicates you wanted, etc, then do it all again for the next line. Thistook all of the processor's time during the visible portion of thedisplay.>There was also a standard 6532 RAM, I/O, Timer (RIOT), plus a voltage>regulator and (if memory serves) a 555 timer.  That's all.The RAM was mapped into the top 128 bytes of page 0, and shadowed in page1. The 6502 has a zero-page addressing mode on most instructions that isboth shorter and faster than the normal ones, so it is important on amachine like this to have the scratchpad RAM in page 0. Unfortunately, italso wants its stack to be in page 1 (the stack pointer is 8 bits, and thehigh byte of the address is hardwired to 1).The IOT section was mapped into page 2 somewhere. 2 8 bit I/O registers(can't remember if each bit could be independantly set to I or O like the6522 and 6526), and 1(?) 8(?) bit timer with a programmable prescaler (Ithink this was some power of 2). There were no interrupts in the system, somany games would set up the timer at some known time, go away and dosomething else for a while, then sit and wait for the timer to run down.There was no logic in the box to do address decoding - the RIOT had atleast 2 chip select pins (probably one active high, one active low), and Iimagine the TIA was much the same. Various address lines were fed directlyto chip selects. The 6507 likes to have ROM right at the top of memory, sothe 2600 had to use ROMs with active high chip selects - not exactlynormal, so some cartriges had a 7404 in them to convert this to the moreusual active low chip select.John West

These use lateral photoeffect detectors [Lindholm andOberg, 1974; Woltring and Marsolais, 1980] to determine the position of aspot of light projected (using a camera lens) over its surface.  In escence,the detector is a large photodiode with four cathodes (one on each of thefour sides of the square detector crystal) and a single anode (the back ofthe crystal).  A spot of light will produce currents which are proportionalto the position of the spot on the detector's face.  Let's try some ASCIIgraphics in 2-D (so the detector has two cathodes to detect linear position)              -------------------------> 1             |                       |             |                       |       |\\           -----   cathode 1         |       |  \\           XXXXX                     ________| +  \\           XXXXX|                            |      \\        -------    light >XXXXX|                            |        \\_____ divider __ output           XXXXX|     |                      |        /      -------           XXXXX|-----| |--                  |      /           |           XXXXX|   + |    |         ________| -  /           1 + 2           XXXXX|         --- gnd    |       |  /           XXXXX|         \\ /        |       |/           XXXXX| anode              |           XXXXX                     |           ----- cathode 2           |             |                       |             |                       |             --------------------------> 2If the dot of light from the LED is the ONLY source of light, then the positionof the projection is given by this circuit regardless of the level of illumina-tion (the divider is used to normalize relative to total received power).  Whenthis circuit is used in the presence of other sources of light, then the way of"tuning" to it is to sample for a few msec the background signal, light the LEDfor an equal time and sample that signal separately.  The difference betweenthe two is the position of the LED.Hamamatsu photonics sells linear and 2-D lateral photoeffect detectors, andthey also sell the required signal processing electronics.  The ready-madesystems by SELSPOT and others are NOT cheap ... Lindholm, L.E., and K.E. Oberg, "An Optoelectronic Instrument for RemoteOn-Line Movement Monitoring", Biotelemetry, 1, 94-95, 1974.Woltring, H.J., and E.B. Marsolais, "Opto-Electronic (SELSPOT) Gait Measure-ments in Two and Three Dimensional Space - A Preliminary Report", Bull. Pros-thetics Research, 46-52, 1980.Most probably this technique can provide you with a much more accuratemeasurement than you need, but I think that its simplicity beats scanninga quadrant detector with a pan/tilt system until you reach zero difference.            - David+------------------------------------------------------------+|  David Prutchi                 HC1DT                       ||  Washington University         <prutchi@mesun4.wustl.edu>  ||  Campus Box 1185               <dp@cec1.wustl.edu>         ||  One Brookings Drive                                       ||  St. Louis, MO  63130-4899                                 |+------------------------------------------------------------+

Your 2F2 capwill have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use inapplications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Theirperformance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap.The other point is that big electro's are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances,so calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when consideringthe cold).You should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain,that "rolls over" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every1,209,600 seconds. If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you wouldneed a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in thefiring times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hzoscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillatorremaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.I would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing thesolenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.Caveat - I'm not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can'tguarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitableconditions.JohnH----------------------------------------------------------------------------      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\/           School of MPCE    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil.spec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 Cand sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long timedelay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In thisapplication, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and triggerpins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip isdisabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset.When triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 xthe timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips canbe programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selectingany combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of itis, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391Kresistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !)Of course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'.After the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14day timing cycle and so forth.Power is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury theelectronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pelletpuker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it tokeep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has towork for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 voltsto spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240's to seewhat I can do with them. Should be interesting (as long as I'm not the one thathas to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my bunsoff ;-)Thanks again everyone...-=-= Wes =-=-

No.  No.  NOOO!!!The ground (green) wire is for safety.  No current is supposed to flow in itunder normal conditions.  This means that there's normally no voltage drop init either.  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire... even ifyou're grounded in some other way at the same time.  The neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return forthe hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there's a voltage drop.  If youplug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet, you can commonly measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground.  They are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel... but nowhere,repeat NOwhere, else.  (Well, almost.  There are strange exceptions for thingslike sub-panels.)What you CAN do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is to use a GFCI outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper).  In fact,depending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.There is a FAQ on electrical wiring, posted regularly to rec.woodworking andnews.answers.  It goes into great detail on these issues (including GFCIs) andyou should probably read it before asking any more questions.  I'll mail a copyto you, append a copy here, and will ask the writers to cross-post it here inthe future. --- Jamie Hanrahan, Kernel Mode Systems, San Diego CAInternet:  jeh@cmkrnl.com  Uucp: uunet!cmkrnl!jeh  CIS: 74140,2055

As I recall the water isn't as hot (thermodynamically) in many>fossil fuel plants, and of course there is less danger of radioactive>contamination.       Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual boiling-water reactor nuclear plants.  (There's a gripe in the industrythat nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So it'smore important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the systemas cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.         Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but theyusually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of theway down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water,rather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about "thermal pollution" de-icing a river, said, "Up here, we view heat as a resource".         Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is purified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing whenthe water boils.  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than cooling it, so the boiler water is recycled.John Nagle

Also consider the 90VAC+ @20Hz that is forced on ringand tip when the phone's supposed to ring!  Even with a simple zenerand LED setup, you might end up with some carbon real quick.  Whateverscheme you use, make sure you've got at least 200V-rated components on the frontend.Also remember that, if I'm not mistaken, the phone line is a 600ohmequivalent circuit.  Any current you draw from the 48V or so getsdropped across that 600ohms.  That's fine until you're down to roughly12V, when Ma Bell considers it to be off-hook.  But dropping it thatfar down is probably a big no-no.The easiest implementation to accomplish the above??    tip  ------->|-----\\/\\/\\/\\-----+----------+              rectifier  resistor  |          |              diode                |          \\                                    V          /                          zener  /---/        \\  resistor                                   |          /                                   |          |                                   |          V   LED                                   |         ---                                   |          |    ring --------------------------+----------+This is only a suggestion...go ahead and blow holes in it, but youget the idea.

Essentially what I am trying to decide is the bestway to handle moving data from a port with automatic handshaking from or to amemory area that will be accessible by a main system processor when not in useby the smart data I/O. Which DMA or microcontroller chip would be best to use?  Fast, cheap, and easyto obtain would be nice, but I won't limit my choices to only those that fitthose characteristics.  Even an 8086/8088 (under $5) would do what I want,but I am sure there is a better alternative -- like a microcontroller withonchip (E)EPROM. So I essentially want to hear about all DMA and microcontrollers that are simpleto interface and will move data from one place to another while monitoring afew I/O lines.

When the tube fires, insufficient current runs through the starter to keep the heat up and the bi-metalic strip straightens out (O/C).BTW, I too thought that they were nothing more than a small neon, so one day when the neon in my sisters digital (flip the metal squares type) clock broke (flimsy leads), I replaced it with one from a starter. Well powering up made a bit of a mess of the clock!CheersPeter T.

Embedthe whole thing in a foam insulated blanket, power it from a solar cell,use the excess power to heat the assembly during the day and relyon the insulation to hold the heat during darkness.  If you don't wantto try thermal management, contact someone like ICL and have them cutyou a special low temperature crystal.  It'll cost at most $20.If you use a single chip micro, you're looking at a parts count of maybe 7.  A processor, a crystal, two caps on the crystal, a power FETto fire the solenoid a flyback diode and a battery.  This is fewer parts than you can build an analog timer for and is infinitely more reliable.

How could I do this?I don't want it just to turn on, I want it to 'strobe' once so to speak,per every beep I put on a cassette tape.

I'm looking for the simplest circuit possible. I guess what I'm asking for is some sort ofcolor organ, but not quite. Let me trt to explain again...     I'm going to have a pattern of beats (or beeps) on a cassette tape.So on the tape you'd hear:   beep! (pause) beep! (pause) beep! (pause)..etc. , with speed increasing as time goes on. I want to synchronize an LED (probably two of them) with the beeps on the cassette tape. So the LED, witheach beep, would go on and off real quick, generating a strobe light sortof effect. The rapidity of the beeps on the tape would in turn effect therapidity of the blinking of the LEDS. And if there was no sound on the tape(except for background his), the LEDs would remain off. Please help!  Thanks,    Dana

(Poor you!)The Macroscrubber from Radio Electronics removes the protection so you souldn't have any more problems.  However, if you use the method of copying it from one VCR to another where the second VCR doesn't react to the protection, you will end up with a duplicate tape, including the protection.One thought comes to mind about your problem...  When playing the tape for viewing, are you feeding the signal from the source VCR through an extra device before going to the TV?  If you feed it through a second VCR first, that is your problem.  As to other devices such as converters, I don't know if they would react or not.  Just to be safe, you might want to make sure that you have NOTHING between the VCR and TV.victor@inqmind.bison.mb.caThe Inquiring Mind BBS, Winnipeg, Manitoba  204 488-1607

What the supply must do,if presented with a load which would draw more than 1A, given thesupply voltage, is reduce the voltage so that the current will equalone amp.  Thus, if we were to short the thing with the ammeter, weshould read one amp.  If we measure the current through a 1 ohm resistor at 12V, we should read one amp (and the output voltage, bynecessity, must be 1V.The only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involvesa circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output power transistor, and therefore reduce the output.So, does anybody have any ideas we could work from?Thanks in advance.Andy Collins, KC6YEYacollins@uclink.berkeley.edups: If anybody wants to flame this as a stupid project, I agree fully,    but I still have to do it, its graded ;^)

One year, I left the batteries in the garage.  The garage is Unheated.  They were left in their places that they needed to be.  One in the ridinglawnmower (what a lux) and one in each motorcycle.  The battery in the riding lawnmower was about 3-4 years old, and one of the cycle batteries was new, and one was around 5 years old.  Upon spring time, I discoveredthat all of the batteries were dead, and needed to be recharged.  They allworked properly, except for the older ones, and they had to be replaced about halfway through the summer.  (they had originally been storedin the garage, and I think I remember my dad charging them in spring)  Last year, I decided to bring them in to the basement, which has two parts.one is dirt and brick, and the other is concrete.  I brought in all three, anddiscovered in the spring, (about 15 days ago) that not only were the batteriesdead, but when I put the charger on them, the charger said "HMMMMMMMM" and the amp-meter read around 1,000,000,000  (In other words, it was pinned)the internal circut tripped, and I went on to the other batteries.  Theywere the same.     Realizing that we still had 2 GIGANTIC sailboat batteries, also leadacid, I decided to put the charger on them.  (these had been sitting for around 1 and a half years, on the brick and dirt part) and noticed that they onlyneeded a small charge, around 2 hours or so on trickle.  I tested themby using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts, and theyworked fine for around 25 of 'em.   This leads me to believe one of several things.     1) I bought really #$%tty batteries last year. (sorta true)     2) the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the        batteries.     3) There was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the           room where the concrete is,      4) The dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air         better than concrete.(BTW, I can almost waterski in the dirt room)     Any other ideas?    *could be the aliens, anything is possible.*

For those who have not heard of this effect, you put acurrent through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one sideto the other.  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  Ithink a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.Anyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box forpicnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and acouple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with anefficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten mycar battery in about half an hour).Unfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basicspecs as a heat pump.  I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as thetemperature gradient across the device increases.  If so, presumablyits power decreases as the back-EMF increases, until eventually wehave a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming noleakage).  If so, then the final temperature difference between thetwo sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more(although that would be a lousy way to control it).What I would like to know is:1: Are the above guesses correct?2: What is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device?   (I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm   too fast when I unplug it)3: How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work?  It looks like   magic!4: Why don't they use these things in domestic fridges/freezers?Thanks in advance,Paul.Paul Johnson (paj@gec-mrc.co.uk).    | Tel: +44 245 73331 ext 3245--------------------------------------------+----------------------------------These ideas and others like them can be had | GEC-Marconi Research is notfor $0.02 each from any reputable idealist. | responsible for my opinions

It is very unlikely, however,that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigsfor cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 wattradio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.If you experience the problem frequently, it may be caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base stationnearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you arecorrect in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferritechokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probablybeing picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes canbe installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).Good instructions are included with the chokes.If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search yourneighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roofor car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are thingsa radio operator can do to reduce interference.-- =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Randall Rhea                                        Informix Software, Inc.

Load the game images into the EEPROM at $2000, $4000, etc. (Your EEPROMburner software may allow this or you will have to assemble the images intoone file yourself with suitable gaps.)2. Wire up the cartridge with the lower address bits going to the gameconsole, and the high bits going to switches to choose between games.To directly answer your question above, the pin that 'kicks up the address'is simply another address line.For a concrete example, with the 27C512 and 8K games images, you wouldwire A0-A12 to the cartridge, and A13-A15 to 3 switches.  The 3 switcheswould allow you to pick from the 8 games on the EEPROM.

I've seen red mask,but most that I've seen are green.A bakelite board will look brown in colour, and, if the solder maskis put on, looks like a brown board with green 'paint' on either side(or just one side) of the board.A fibreglass board will look green from the side, because the greensolder-mask makes the board appear that colour. If you got a fibreglassboard with no mask, it would be a whitish-grey colour.Teflon boards do exist, as well... but I'm not sure about that one.I'd guess the stuff they invented for solder mask was green, so they'renot about to change. Also, any change in any chemical probably requiresa better than normal cleaning of the machines that make boards. A lotof companies do not make their own boards... they ship them to a realboardhouse.
