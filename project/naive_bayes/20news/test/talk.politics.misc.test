Where have we heard that before???No, Bill, my full original post included sufficient disclaimers so thatyou could see that I was not claiming that it was a perfect world fromthe Branch Davidians point of view. The point of my article was that itis inappropriate to compare Massada and the fate of the Jewish rebelsto Waco. The Zealot men faced certain execution in a way that wasanathema to their religion, and they knew that their wives and childrenwould be enslaved. American prisons may not be garden spots, but theydon't compare to what the survivors of Massada might have faced. Youindicate that you agree that the Branch Davidians faced a trial. Howdoes that fact alone make for a comparison here?  Even if thegovernment had wanted to find "fall guys" for the BATF deaths, theystill had to prove it to a jury.Once again, my point was quite simple--any comparison between thesituation of the Branch Davidians and the Jews of Massada is absurd.-- ________________________________________Jack F.

What I resent is ignorant statements that call peoplenames when they disagree with your position. Opposing theatrocities commited by the Israeli governement hardly qualifiesas anti-semitism. If you think name calling is a valid form ofargument in intellectual circles, you need to get out moreoften.I don't think the suffering of some Jews during WWIIjustifies the crimes commited by the Israeli government. Anyattempt to call Civil liberterians like myself anti-semetic isnot appreciated.

In 1838, the governor of Missouri,governor Boggs, issued his so-called "Mormon extermination order."  Theonly crime ("illegal activity") the Latter-day Saints had committed, wastheir religious affiliation, their anti-slave stance (Missouri stillallowed slave practices), and their growing numbers/influence in Missouri.I guess the Mormons "got what they deserved," because they refused to bowto the will of (corrupt and evil) secular authorities. This "disobedience"brought upon them persecution, murder, and finally forced expulsion fromtheir lands and settlements...In the 1850s, the so-called "Utah-War" was forced upon the early Mormonsettlers, and their "illegal activities" consisted no less in living astheir conscience dictated, and to be sovereign/independant in Utah's(or "Deseret Territory" as it was called at the time) constitutionaldaily affairs.  (In order to subdue this clear threat to the survival ofthe United States of America, an entire army under the command of GeneralJohnson (hence "Johnson's Army"), invaded the territory to "restore"Uncle Sam's law and order...)History has the uncanny ability to draw certain parallels between eventsthat might appear unrelated, but are very much the same in spirit andintent.  That same mob- or persecution-prone attitude is to be found inthis user-group: when we tried to organize "soc.religion.mormon" and/or"talk.religion.mormon," a whole bunch of "charitable" believers effectivelyblocked our intent to create a group to discuss topics related to Mormonismet al in an appropriate forum.  We really must be a "threat" to variousestablishments...  Frustrating our legitimate rights for proper representa-tion also belongs in the category of persecution.  It is ironic that thosewho oppose us, point to all kinds of "justifications" to do so, despitetheir claims of adhering to a gospel of love...In any regard, Mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities (andI don't even discuss how Uthan's were suckered into allowing part of theirlands in becoming nerve-gas and atomic bomb testing grounds...) is far frombeing trusted or righteous.  Have things really changed for the better?  Imay be a born cynic, but I have NO reason whatsoever that such has been thecase. In the early 1980s, I believe, the late President Kimball (lds churchleader), strongly protested federal attempts to locate the MX-"Peace Keeper"missile maze from being built in Utah (yet another "inspired" decision fromsecular authorities).  Fortunately, his opposition was influential enoughfor the feds to back off.Lest anyone believe I do not believe in government: I do, but NOT withoutquestioning the wisdom and constitutionality of their decisions andresolves.  The government's actions around the Mt. Carmel compound in Wacowas NOT wise, neither was it necessary.  David Koresh did NOT pose a greatthreat to the federal authorities or the security of this nation, and withJohn, I too wonder who or what's next...#|> We used to live in a country where everyone enjoyed the free exercise#|> of their rights to worship and bear arms.  Now we don't.##Does that include the right to murder little children?  How about killing#ATF officers?  I do not know much about the gun laws in Texas, but#Koresh's folks claimed to have grenades, grenade launchers, and rocket#launchers.

What constitutional right did the ATF officers have toinvade upon private land and to force themselves into the compound?What REALLY caused the "murder" of the little children?  Could it be thatthe ATF/FBI presence has any bearing upon the events?  How would youinterpret the Mt. Masada events?  --Blame the Jews?  (What the heck didthe Romans do there anyway?  What business did the ATF/FBI has in Waco,Texas???)  The Branch Davidians NEVER posed any threat to society.David Koresh, no doubt, will be described as the "evil" guy (by theexecutioners), while the actions of all those "valiant and brave" officersmay have been "regrettable," but alas, "necessary" to serve some dubiouspublic/national interest. --I guess they are still figuring it out how tosell this one to the nation...#|> Of course, to Jews and Mormons this is just a broken record.

EDT          THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that Octavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today about why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to get a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature of learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of people like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of those who are here.            I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education and all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my good friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and all of the business and local community leaders from the city and county and state level from around America who are here.           This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved hearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is their future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A year and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because I was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our country, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had too little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines of income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to take us into the future.            I entered with the hope that together we could create more opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of our people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of America's community, knowing that together we could always to more than we could individually and that we might secure our future.          All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 jobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the commitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, and those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs does, and the successes of all the young people like those on this stage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all those things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're on the right track.          Last July when I was traveling across America's heartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in Louisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business people who were participating in the Louisville Education and Employment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  I saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed both in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my own state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about -- that for millions of American young people it is really an impediment to both their learning and their ability to be good workers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what is learning.          In the world in which we are living, the average young person will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a lifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning world much better.  And we must determine that all of our young people see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased here today.            Whether you're in business or in government or in education, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to building a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all of our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things are pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best thing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have jobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)            They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty good education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that they'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either political or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great challenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to fully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work for them to do.          All the European countries have higher unemployment rates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the unemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  They're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its most rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that I have proposed to create jobs.           In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now about as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  It costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of pressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing their own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their people.            But it is especially important for America for two reasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move aggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be competitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, even if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed of the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to work in this country.  (Applause.)          We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some of it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and moving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We have now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big organizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they are organized and who ask whether there are too many people working at some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to create jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the chance to work.            It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare reform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of months -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the end of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  (Applause.)          So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of the American people to perform without regard to race or income or the circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that there are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their talent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  I do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if you want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more responsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this country that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you have got to have opportunity in that mix.           A part of our vision for America has to be a future for every young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules and work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be something at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are basically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, recognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of our people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their background.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's something there for them to do?     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an integral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of work and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people first, and it does have a partnership between the public and private sector.          I said when I addressed the United States Congress in February on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 extra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the American business community to meet that target so that we can create  more than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been created before.          Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And Jerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in this room and around the country -- people who are going to do more than they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people a work experience.  And it is terribly important.          I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is part of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the American people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their jobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving the transition from school to work for young people who don't go to college but do need at least two years of post-high school training either on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, so that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more people to go on to college who do want to go.          All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive plan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The emergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would create a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and that would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It would also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work force in jobs that otherwise will not be created.           It also will help a lot of cities and counties to invest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --projects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, new industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities -- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve the environment.            The summer jobs program is an important part of that because we have tried for the first time, through the work of the Labor Department and the Education Department and through reaching out to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer jobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to hopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young people into further educational opportunities and to further job opportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component to these summer jobs -- something that the United States government has never fully emphasized before.            A lot of these young people, as you well know, because they come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in difficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building their basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other areas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who have difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what they learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next year.            What we are trying to do here is to give people the opportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning skills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next couple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school in this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning environment.            There will be more applied academics, more opportunities for people to learn and work during the school year, so that this will not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will be a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new work experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.          The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-work jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding the job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help to build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve local problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public buildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in hospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, and learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while they earn, but letting them earn.          You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people who have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should do this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the opportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing in going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't exactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare system; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people to work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the use of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if you're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to reward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  (Applause.)          The young people we propose to put to work under our program will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, reading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will stretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a sense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, but a challenge that will take them into a different life.          So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even as I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the summer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll see whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer academically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved ahead.  I suspect that they will.            This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I will be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn from you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next summer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school year, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that we do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so that we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private investments as well.           We want to honor the companies and the communities, the business leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this summer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business who have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who haven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about this event today, I want to implore other private employers to stretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this summer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when we don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort them to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)          When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up here on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking about work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've done to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very foolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand and sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had ever had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be worth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)          That does not mean young people should not be entrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation ahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and worked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  And I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some people say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)            I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I grew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul without regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a job.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to people is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a job and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now I live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any more money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're working longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  And we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these young people want.          Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  It doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration pursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private sector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn how to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created in this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done off-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a third or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do economically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of America's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just kidding.            On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy country in the world, including the United States, is having difficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done I'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole deliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the answers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  (Applause.)          And so the jobs program that I have presented to Congress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the counties, through the Community Development Program, with the infrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an attempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the economy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little boost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a million jobs and maybe get the engine going again.          Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in the private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government money.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American economy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind of system we have and it works pretty well.            But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you here today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends and neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers to make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the funds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government should create this summer, so that together we can have this partnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a future -- a future that our young people can believe in.            We need to send them a message that here in America if you study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute something to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  You can build a future from you own dreams.           That has always been the promise of America.  Together that's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of the promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise has been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.          Thank you very much.  (Applause.)                                 END11:45 A.M. EDT

I'm not sure if you meant to imply that or not, but I just thought># I'd bring that up.>Hitler became Chancellor because people voted for his political>party.  That's not a huge difference in a parliamentary system.Your statement is a common misconception, but it just isn't true. In theGerman Weimar system, the Chancellor was not necessarily the leader of thelargest Reichstag party; the Chancellor was appointed by the President andgenerally was the leader of a coalition of parties who could form an effectivemajority in the Reichstag. Beyond that, the implication that Hitler rose tothe Chancellorship because a majority of Germans wanted Nazi rule is falseas well. Before President Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor in January1933, the German people did not show a particular desire to be led either byHitler or by the Nazi party. These are the results of the March 1932 electionfor President, the closest Hitler ever came to direct election: Hindenburg49.6%, Hitler 30.1%, Thaelmann 13.2%, Duesterberg 6.8%. In the runoff electionin April the results were: Hindenburg 53%, Hitler 36.8%, Thaelmann 10.2%.So we can see that Hitler personally was supported by only about a third ofGerman voters.Similarly, the Nazi party never received more than 37% of the vote inReichstag elections. That occurred in July 1932. In the November 1932 electionthe Nazis *lost* two million votes and 34 seats, down from 230 to 196 out ofthe 608 in the Reichstag. Comparitively, the Socialists had 121 and theCommunists 100. The Communists had gained 11 seats, and the German Nationalparty, which had supported the previous government, had picked up a millionof the Nazis' lost votes to gain 15 seats (up to 52). I think the other largeparty was the Catholic Center party (I don't know how many seats they had butI think they were declining), and there were numerous other small parties.Thus the Nazi vote was on the decline at the time Hitler was appointedChancellor.What brought Hitler to power was *not* the demand of the German people forHitler or the Nazis to run things, but the inability of the other parties toput their differences behind them in favor of forming an effective governmentfor the country. Germany did not have an enduring democratic tradition, andtheir parliamentary system lacked effective center parties that favored theinterests of the majority of the population. Instead what they had was anumber of small parties who were unable to put aside their own specificobjectives in order to combine against the Nazis, who were out to end thedemocratic process. In fact, part of the problem was that some of the otherparties with substantial representation, like the Communists, were alsoout to end the democratic process, but with different results in mind, andgenerally didn't mind seeing parliamentary democracy go under.Germany had already had a non-Nazi Chancellor with a majority coalitionfor five months while the Nazis had been the largest Reichstag party, andthere certainly was no danger of a revolution in favor of the Nazis.If anything the Nazis were starting to get desperate because they had failedto get enough support to make Hitler President and their popular vote hadbegun to decline.Hitler was not Hindenburg's first choice to be Chancellor, not even hissecond choice. First, von Papen had been Chancellor since June 1932. Afterthe November election when the Nazis *lost* seats, Hindenburg first prevailedon von Papen to remain as Chancellor. But there were intrigues behind his backand support for him was lacking. So then Hindenburg turned to von Schleicher,who became Chancellor for two months. Eventually he too was unable to holdtogether a working coalition of parties to oppose the Nazis, who refused toparticipate in any government that was not led by a Nazi Chancellor. Some ofthe Nazi leadership, particularly Gregor Strasser who was the #2 man in theparty at the time, wanted to participate in a coalition government. But others,knowing the party's support was waning, figured that their best hope to gainpower lay in undermining the democratic process. Nevertheless, the countrywas governed for seven months by Chancellors who were not Nazis, even thoughthe Nazis were the largest Reichstag party. The failure of these men toachieve a working coalition was due to the inability of their coalitionparties to work together.Here's how William Shirer puts it in _The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich_:   The cardinal error of the Germans who opposed Nazism was their   failure to unite against it. At the crest of their popular strength,   in July 1932, the National Socialists had attained but 37 percent of   the vote. But the 63 percent of the German people who expressed their   opposition to Hitler were much too divided and shortsighted to combine   against a common danger which they must have known would overwhelm   them unless they united, however temporarily, to stamp it out.True, the German people supported Hitler after he became Chancellor. Butthat doesn't change the fact that there was not overwhelming support for him*before* he was in power. The German people were not crying out for Hitler totake over, no matter how bad economic conditions were. The leftist parties(Socialists/Communists) probably had more support in total than the Nazis.Hitler used the fact that others were passively or actively willing to seethe government paralyzed as a means to taking it over.-----Eric Smitherics@netcom.comerics@infoserv.comCI$: 70262,3610

Joseph Biden, D-Del., told Christopher at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  ``Preventive diplomacy is not in your capability right now in Bosnia- Herzegovina. Biden chastised the administration and its Republican predecessor for what he characterized as a limp response to the Serbian policy of  ``ethnic cleansing'' of Muslims, including rape and shelling of civilians. ``The time has come for us and the world to stop bemoaning the fact that all the options are bad ones,'' Biden said. ``They are all bad ones and we ought to pick a couple.'' Biden also endorsed lifting an international arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia so the Muslim-dominated Bosnian government might have a chance to at least defend itself against the Serbs. Christopher said this could give an opening role in the conflict to                     **************************************************** the radical Islamic government of Iran.***************************************O, I C!   Biden endorsed bombing Serbian heavy weapons around the besieged  eastern town of Srebrenica.  ``There's not a military person...who will not tell you that they  could today, if you gave them the order, take out the heavy weaponry  around Srebrenica,'' Biden said.  ``If you did nothing else, nothing else but that, you would have  saved hundreds of women and children who are being absolutely massacred  right now.''  Military action ``is the only thing that's going to change the  equation,'' Biden said.....................................  Despite the frustrations and pressure, Christopher had no enthusiasm  for American combat aircraft to strike Serb positions in Bosnia-  Herzegovina.....................>``Clearly we are at a turning point in the Bosnia situation,''>Christopher said. ``Air strikes are among those steps that are so>complex because they tend to interfere with the humanitarian endeavours.>I think there may be better options.''Humanitarian as in feeding them and let them get raped and killed.>political conflict.

A new national survey says drugs are easier to get, more teens are    using them and fewer deem drug use as risky.     For the last two years, government officials have trumpeted results    from the National High School Survey as signs that the drug war is    being won.  But this year, officials are retreating - drug use by    eighth-graders has risen, according to the survey of 50,000 students    nationwide.    Possible reason for the increase:  more experimentation.  Why?  If    drug use dropped during the '80s, eventually some students will    have fewer "drug-using contemporaries" who act as examples of    substance abuse's drawbacks, says social psychologist Lloyd Johnston,    one of the survey authors.  Each new wave of youths "must be given    the knowledge, skills and motivation to resist using these drugs,"    Johnston says.    This type of resurgence "is possible," says Eileen Shiff, author of    "Experts Advise Parents" (Delta, $14.95).  But that's not the issue,    she says.  The prevalence of alcohol and drugs among teens today    could result in more alcoholic adults decades from now.    Aggravating the problem:  baby boomer parents - who experimented with    drugs and alcohol as teens - trying to be friends, not parents, to    their children.  "I've even seen parents serving kegs of beer" to    their underage kids and friends, Shiff says.  For a recent graduation,    Shiff and other parents organized an all-night, "lock-in" party where    no booze or drugs were allowed.  "We need to fulfill that parental    role, otherwise the peer group takes over," she says.    Officials may "talk about the war on drugs, but they really haven't    done anything that I've seen," says Suzanne Linkous, Scottsdale,    Ariz., 16, a volunteer who talks with teens about drugs, dating and    other issues on a peer counseling and suicide hot line.  Linkous, a    member of USA Today's Teen Panel, says "there's always going to be    experimentation" with drugs.    A real war on drugs could be waged "education-wise," she says.  But    "some don't want to give kids the facts.  They think it will give    them ideas; it's the same with birth control.  I think you should    give the kids the information or have it accessible" through classes,    pamphlets and speakers, she says.    Education efforts need to start as soon as kids get in school - in    kindergarten, says Dallas Owens, 17, teen panelist from Miami Shores,    Fla.  "I remember in kindergarten, I used to see (drugs).  I think    kids in the 10th and 12th grades have already made up their minds    (about using drugs)," he says.    Scare tactics in public service announcements aren't working; only    one commercial has gotten it right, he says.  The commercial opens    with two "good-looking girls" in the restroom talking about having    no prom date.  Then they take a hit off a joint.  "That hits home    because it's not attractive," he says.  "You can't be doing drugs if    you want somebody to like you."

The people there arerather pissed off because the USA first supported the Shah who theyloathed and then supported Saddam when he mounted an unprovoked attack. Hardly surprizing after the embassy hostage crisis but Iran is meant to bethe country run by unreasonable bigots not the USA so if there is to bemovement it would be easier for the USA to move.First off they could recognise Iraqu's responsibility in initiating theIran/Iraq war. Providing technical assistance to Iran to get it's oilproduction back up to capacity would also be a smart move, at the moment Iran is above it's OPEC ceiling. If they had extra capacity they woulduse it and bring down the oild price further which is in our interests.The Iranian clerics would have an interest in seeking a raprochment simply because a permanent war footing is debilitating.

One might findoneself, as I did in late 1986, anticipating expenses in the near termthat require selling off holdings.  Given the choice between waiting afew weeks (and taking an extra tax hit) or selling in December withpreferential tax treatment, only a fool would choose the former.2) The fact that Brett can now construct _post hoc_ calculations ofwhat would have been more beneficial to investors is in many respectsbeside the point.  There was plenty of _Money_-style advice given tounsophisticated investors in late 1986 to "sell now and save ontaxes."  In case anyone missed it, there was no shortage of similaradvice late last year (in the NYTimes, e.g.), even though that advicewas based not on the foregone conclusion of enacted law (as in 1986),but merely on the *assumption* that Clinton would raise tax rates(without capping CG taxes, contrary to the current proposal).It's nice to think that investors always behave in their optimaleconomic interest.  Like assuming weightless ropes and frictionlesspulleys, though, this sort of thinking often fails to describeaccurately what happens in the real world.-- MORAL: Always Choose the Right Sort of Parents        Before You Start in to be Rough                                        - George AdeMark Eckenwiler    eck@panix.com    ...!cmcl2!panix!eck

Here we have a self-described libertarian    getting all sentimental over a religious and national entity   not exactly known for respecting individualism.   In somewhat   more detail it should be noted that the whole concept of a    religion, and especially a patriarchial one like Judaism    (or Islam, or Christianity) is obediance to rules and authority.   Leviticus, Deuteronomy, etc are FULL of "thou shalt"s and "thou   shalt not"s.   And of course Israel's concept of human rights, while   no doubt better than places like Syria's or Iraqs, is hardly the    stuff to warm the cockles of a libertarian's heart.---peter

Richard Hirschhaut, director of the San Francisco branch of the ADL, art dealer Roy Bullock and former policeman Tom Gerard were also named as defendants in the suit, filed in San Francisco County Superior Court.      The 19 accuse the ADL of B'nai B'rith, a group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, and the other defendants of secretly gathering information on them, including data from state and federal agencies.      The suit alleges they disclosed the information to others, including the governments of Israel and South Africa, in what it alleges was a ``a massive spying operation.''      The action is a class-action suit. It was filed on behalf of about 12,000 anti-apartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom the plaintiffs believe the ADL, Bullock and Gerard gathered information.      Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately  available for comment on Wednesday.      The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that Gerard, a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit, passed confidential police files on California political activists to a spy ring.      The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL, Bullock and Gerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL's offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles.      The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California, which prohibits the publication of information obtained from official  sources.  It seeks exemplary damages of at least $2,500 per person as well as  other unspecified damages.      Lawyer Pete McCloskey, a former Congresmen who is representing the plaintiffs, said the 19 plaintiffs included Arab-Americans and Jews -- and  his wife Helen, who also had information gathered about her.      One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens, a research scientist at the University of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli Defence Minister.      Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept on him in the 1980s, presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of Palestinians and his position on the Israeli-occupied territories.      According to court documents released last week, Bullock and Gerard both kept information on thousands of California political activists.      In the documents, a police investigator said he believed the ADL paid Bullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and Bullock received confidential information from the authorities.      No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case. The ADL, Bullock and Gerard have all denied any wrongdoing.  ...........  js

Which points to an anti-bias-against wrtblacks.In any case, for violent crimes and burglary and drug selling, blacks arereported 53%, arrested 44%, and are present in jails/prisons 47% (1988).Considering that 12% of the population is black, 6% are black males, andsome percentage of that is out of the high/low age groups, we do have asituation where (if I remember my old calculations right) 4% of thepopulation commits almost half of the really nasty crimes.Blacks with similar histories (crime) to whites get the same sentences,except in the South, where they receive around 20% less on paper!!-- There are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind ofenvironmental disaster.

The survey presented, according to Mr. Cramer,a value called the median- which one used this makes us believe that 1/2 of the males had 7.3 plus sex partners and1/2 of the males had 7.3 or less sex partners.  Homosexualsare purported to make up only 1%.  In this case, the majorityof people with 7.3 plus sex partners are heterosexual.It is my feeling that median was not the intended word usage.But if it is then we have little evidence to support Mr. Cramerclaims about gay promiscuity > hetero promiscuity.>>Many netters, Mr. Cramer included, often forget that the>American media are merely a number of businesses, who's>purpose in life is to make money for their owners and>stockholders.

Many more have inadequate coverage,meaning that they could be bankrupted by a major illness.(23) In fact,one  health  care  expert  says that because  only 1  percent  of  thepopulation  has   private   longterm-care  insurance,  "virtually  anyAmerican could be  impoverished by a prolonged disabling illness."(24)Additionally, as many as  40 percent of those  eligible for some formsof public aid do not  receive  it.

Then you can come home to something like this:    "Well, it's been a rough month," begins Johnnie Lawmaster.  "I just get laid off, and my divorce became final.  But I just wasn't ready for what happened this particular Monday."    That particular Monday was was December 16, the first day of the Bill of Rights' third century, the day when federal agents and local law enforcement officer broke into the house in Tulsa that always flew the U.S. flag.  When Lawmaster drove into the driveway that bleak afternoon, one of his neighbors had some news.    "'Ohmigod, John, you are in big trouble!' my neighbor tells me. 'Sixty police, federal agents and the bomb squad busted in you house, kicked down the door, cut locks off your gun safe.'  I couldn't believe it.  Then I walked inside.  What a nightmare."    It was no nightmare; it was horribly real life.  Apparently acting on information the Lawmaster possessed an illegal firearm, some thirty agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) teamed up with state and Tulsa police authorities, search warrant in hand, to search for a "Colt, AR-15, .223 caliber machine gun, unknown serial number."  The warrant, issued by U.S. Magistrate John Leo Wagner, also authorized agents to seize "any tools used in the alteration or modification of firearms, such as files or drills; documents, papers, books, records, and other tangible properties which identify occupants or owners of the property to be searched...."    Reports vary, but according to neighbors, the joint task force operation aimed at the unemployed warehouseman from a nearby hospital involved some 60 agents and local law enforcement personnel against Lawmaster.  They cordoned off the street; took station with weapons drawn in the back yard; used a battering ram to break through the front door; kicked in the back door; broke into his gun safe; threw personal papers around the house; spilled boxes of ammunition on the floor; broke into a small, locked box that contained precious coins; stood on a table to peer through the ceiling tiles, breaking the table in the process.  Then, they left.  The doors were closed but not latched, much less locked.  The ammo and guns were left unsecured.    "My front and back doors were pulled shut, but they were busted through and couldn't latch.  Anybody could have waltzed in there and stolen everything I own.  A child could have taken a gun.  The guns, the safe -- everything was open and laying around.  I keep all my magazines empty, but someone had loaded them.  While I was looking around in amazement, the gas, electric and water companies show up to turn the power off.  They said they were told to shut things down. Then I found the note.  "Nothing Found - ATF."    "They didn't make any attempt to notify me.  I've lived in Tulsa all my life and never got more than a traffic ticket.  How come they can't look that up, realize I've been law-abiding my whole life, then come to the door when I'm home?  They didn't leave someone here to watch over my private property.  They didn't even come by to explain what happened.  They just raided my home, ransaked it, left it wide open and left."    Lawmaster placed a phone call to the local BATF agent.  "I asked, 'Are you gonna' arrest me?' and he said, 'No.'  I asken him, "Who is going to repair and clean up my house?'  And he said, "If you're going to talk to me, come down to my office.'    "'I can't come down!' I said.  'My doors are broken!'  If I had been on vacation and I didn't have friendly neighbors, I would have lost everything I own.  Here I am a competent, responsible firearms owner, and the government leaves them open, unlocked, with ammo strewn around."    Lawmaster said the agent advised him, "If you want your door to lock and your gun safe to lock, you're gonna' have to pay for it yourself."    "'Oh, I'll come right down, alright,' I told him.  'I'll come down, but I'll bring my attorney.'  And he said, 'Well, you bring your attorney, and we won't talk to you.'"So if you don't want your tea party to be held in awkward silence, makesure your lawyer isn't there, there's a good chap.> It's very sad all those people died, especially the kids, but that's going> to happen in a free society whenever psychologically needy people hook up> with a charismatic nutcase.What a repulsive outlook on society.

Non-toxic tear gas?!?  Do you know what tear gas is?       I do: once upon a time I happened to be in a room when someone threw        a tear-gas grenade in (that was supposed to be a joke:).  The sensation        was incredible: I felt my eyes and nostrils were being torn apart.       I remember us - a bunch of young men in our early 20's - running out       like a herd of wild animals, knocking down the door and jumping       out of the windows (thank G-d we were on the first floor).       I can't imagine this kind of stuff being used against children.For them, the worst effect might not be the physical effects so muchas the psychological effect of being incapacitated without fullyunderstanding the cause.  Many years ago, I was accidentally exposedto a tiny dose of tear gas.  (It was in Athens, on the street leadingto the American Embassy; there'd been a march that had been broken upwith tear-gas; I must have stumbled into a remaining patch of gas thenext day.)  Aside from the tears, feeling sick to my stomach, etc.,the really horrible psychological effect was that of suddenly fallingto pieces and not knowing why it had happened---I was horrified andwondered what disease or other health problem I had.  (I didn't findout about the march and the tear-gas till hours later.)  I can imaginehow horribly disorienting this might be to very young children:suddenly crying uncontrollably and feeling sick, weak, and out ofcontrol of your body---and not knowing the cause.``This gives us a chance to try the Gas of Peace.''  Yeah, right.---30-Bob Ingria

The United States, withits people, have recognized that repression has taken place, with theloss and outright abrogation of civil liberties and constitutionalprotections of citizens. This recognition has taken the form of thecivil rights law (let's just discuss the federal level for now), suchas 18 USC 241 et. seq., 42 USC 1981 et. seq, et. al.   With this recognition of repression, at times manifested in theform of collective guilt, I want people to recognize denial. Though it can be said that white people numerically commit morecrimes in the United States, because white people are a majority,it can also be said that black people commit a disproportionateamount of crime in the United States, in their relation to theirnumbers in population.   My views are out of experiences when I was a police officerin a large metropolitan area, and of a citizen.

There is a vast difference>between Equal Justice under the Law and Egalitarianism.What I meant, if it was not clear, was the intersection set of liberaland libertarian philosophies of "natural rights" and how the government(and Constitutional interpretation in particular) fits into that philosophy.  This philosophy engages in the very serious practical error of endowing the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court with an almost totalitarian authority, completely outside of the consent or consensus of The People.  This is why Supreme Court nominations are such amazingpolitical fist-fights these days, because He who Controls the CourtRules the Country.  The people on the Court may well be trying to dothe best job they can, but they are at best a benevolent oligarch, evenif you approve of every Supreme Court decision ever.  Eventually, anoligarch will arise that will decimate that which you hold dear.  Try Supreme Court cases by Jury, and the problem would be mitigated a great deal.Those who would create broad, non-enumerated government powers at any level (as in European Parlamentary Democracies and the current de-factostandard in the U.S.) have essentially engaged in the same fundamental mistake, except that it is some different body that has the totalitarian, virtually unchecked (except by plurality election, death, or retirement), government power. >  And *why* should your community be allowed to stop my activities>when I'm not picking your pocket or defrauding you? Just because>you don't like it? Because you find it morally repugnant? This is like asking why the wind blows, unless you can prove thatthe fact of your engaging in certain activities has absolutely no effect whatsoever on any other human being who has not consented toyour engagement in those activities.  Very few human activities indeedfit into this category.  Even for those few that do, who would you empower to make the judgement of what is and is not a fully autonomous activity?  Who defines "picking my pocket" and "defrauding"?  Are economic assets a person's only assets,or are peace of mind, stability, confidence in a child's emotional environment, security, and many other things not also a part of a person'sassets?  What gives you the right to create a moral environment that aparent strongly objects to?  What gives you the right to create an environment of social unrest and instability?  If you say that what youdo does not have those effects, by what authority do you say that?  Whois empowered to make these value judgements?>How >would *you* feel if I got a gang together and found xtianity>(or insert your favorite cause here) morally repugnant and>passed laws to outlaw its free exercise? (all at a local>level, since that seems to be A-OK with you)>If the Federal Constitution explicitly prohibited you from doing so, the federal government would prevent you from doing so.  If it did not, andyou could muster enough local support to pass an amendment to the localConstitution (by, say, a 3/4 majority) empowering the local government to do so, then I would have to vote with my feet and move to a neighborhoodmore friendly to my own system of values.  This is not an ideal situation,but it is far better than the mess we are mired in right now.>> As to the "gang of pitchfork and torch wielding friends", there are very>> few restrictive local laws that I personally would advocate or vote for,>> since I am of the view that exercising government power over your neighbors>> should be done with extreme care and only when absolutely necessary.

The debate is not whether you or a>communitity would or would not vote away my rights; it is>the propriety of whether that should even be an *option*.When you define "rights" very broadly, there is no practical choice about whether people will or will not infringe upon your rights since these"rights" overlap.  Even when rights are defined very narrowly, the government has been empowered to prevent others from infringing on your rights.  The fundamental question is, by whose authority is that power created.  If you support the current situation with a "natural rights" Supreme Court (ratherthan an "original understanding" Supreme Court or, even better, SupremeCourt by Jury), you are consenting to having nine lawyers in Washington, D.C. create those powers out of the air.  In my "Fractal Federalism" scenario, it is a broad consensus of The People (i.e. the amendment process) that creates those powers.>> Certainly not the only cause, Mike, but people in a local neighborhood>> should have a voice in what goes on in that neighborhood.

Ammunition is not as dangerous when simply burned as itis when fired from a gun.  The brass case is not capable of holdingthe pressure generated by burning powder, and will (unless supportedby the walls of a gun barrel or chamber) simply split open.  Whilethis may cause small pieces of brass to fly around, it will notpropel the bullet with any significant velocity.In fact, it was not uncommon in years past to dispose of old loadedcartridges by burning them.  As long as you were not close enoughto take a piece of flying brass in the eye, you were reasonably safe.Thus, the detonation of loaded magazines or loose rounds might causeslight injury but would be unlikely to cause fatal bullet wounds.                               -- Alane --   /-----------------------------------------------------------------\\  /   NOBODY shares my opinions,    |    "I am a jelly doughnut"      \\ /    especially not my employer    |    -- President John F Kennedy   \\/-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\

It'struely a sad day for religious freedom in this country.  The BranchDividians may have been nutty (my general opinion of all religious people),but tax evasion and illegal possesion of firearms are certainly not groundsfor destroying a people.The killing of the four BATF agents was surey a dispicable act, but that wasan escalation of the confrontation which the BATF started.  War is badprecisely because of humanity's tendancy for escalation.  That principleapplies to all cases of warfare- whether it's between nuclear superpowers,feuding families or fledgling religious groups and our federal govt.  Whywas warfare chosen as the course of action when patience and subtlety wouldalso have worked?  Why is the petty letter of the law more important thanpeoples' lives and religious beliefs?  Perhaps the supposed professionals inour federal law inforcement agencies are just plain stupid.It was interesting to watch the 700 club today.  Pat Robertson said that the"Branch Dividians had met the firey end for worshipping their false god." Healso said that this was a terrible tragedy and that the FBI really blew it. However, I still feel that he's forgetting that every major religion in theworld had a similarly humble 'cult-status' beginning- even, and perhapsespecially, christianity.  It is perhaps worthwhile to consider that theBranch Dividians' apocalyptic prophecies have been fulfilled.

AsI've noted before, I'm not necessarily disputing the benefits of eliminating anti-competitive legislation with regard to auto dealers,barbers, etc.  One need not, however, swallow the entire libertarianagenda to accomplish this end.  Just because one grants the benefits ofallowing anyone who wishes to cut hair to sell his/her services withoutregulation does not mean that the same unregulated barbers should be free to bleed people as a medical service without government intervention.  (As some/many libertarians would argue.)  On a case by case basis, the cost/benefit ratio of government regulationis obviously worthwhile.  The libertarian agenda, however, does not callfor this assessment.  It assumes that the costs of regulation (of anykind) always outweigh its benefits.  This approach avoids all sorts of difficult analysis, but it strikes many of the rest of us as dogmatic, to say the least.I have no objection to an analysis of medical care, education, national defense or local police that suggests a "free market" can providea more effective, efficient means of accomplishing social objectivesthan is provided through "statist" approaches.   With some notableexceptions, however, I do not see such nitty-gritty, worthwhile analysis being carried out by self-professed libertarians.  jsh--Steve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM   "One thing about data, it sure does cut|  UUCP:    ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh the bulls**t." - R.

Even if the readers have the slightest idea as to what thewriter is referring to, it should be incumbent on Mr. Erwin to back up whathe says with at least a concrete example of perhaps even a reference or two.(For example, "Simon Zealotes" = the certain apostle having a nicknameconnected to a Jewish terrorist group)Even Josephus fails to make the kind of broad brush reference toChristians made above - he is quite silent as to the fate of the JewishChristian Church in Jerusalem, even though he took the time torecord the death of St. James (brother of St. John). On the subject of thefate of Jesus's family, including James (the brother of Jesus) we learnnothing from Josephus.Likewise, Tacitus condemns the Jews as being a particularly vicious people, getting many of the facts about Jewish history wrong inthe process. But even though Tactitus undoubtedly had the opportunityto learn much about the Christians during his tour in Asia Minor underDomitian, we find little to enlighten ourselves about the Christiansin either the _Histories_ or the _Annals_The writer's interpretation of _Acts_ is purely subjective asstated, and so one might expect him to elaborate a bit on just what aspectsof "cult psychology" are to be found there.

The following letter, which represents a small portion of the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical documents, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs, was sent to President Bill Clinton, members of Congress, editors, program directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and radio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people. On April 23 of every year, the people of Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the lost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their lives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations may live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and prosperously.------------------------- letter ----------------------------------During the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day, Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland, which is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocidein order to shift international public opinion away from its politicalresponsibility.2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish Genocide.3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism throughthe ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-SovietArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence throughterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supportersof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community frommaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorialdemands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish peoplewill unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victimsof the Turkish Genocide demand:1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian Dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish andKurdish people;3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officiallyrecognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuseto succumb to all Armenian political pressure;5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of 2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in theefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new generation has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politicallymature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, throughall necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the armed struggle. Therefore, the victims of the Turkish Genocide call uponall Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in the political, cultural and religious activities of the 78th Anniversaryof the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

Brett himself has actually posted the data previously.What declined from 84 to 89, as I remember it, was _percentincrease_in_deficit_growth, i.e. the rate of growth of the deficit (2nd derivative of total deficit with respect of to time) decreased.Brett apparently has numbed himself into thinking that the deficitdeclined.  If you keep spending more than you earn, the deficit keepsgrowing.  If you keep _borrowing_ at a lesser rate than you borrowedpreviously, the deficit increases.  You only decrease deficits when yourincome exceeds spending and you use the difference to pay off debts.Figgie's book paints the real data, pictorially, in gory detail.  Eachpresident, essentially ran up twice as much total debt, in half the time.Reagan/congress was simply awful.  Bush/congress was unbelievable.As a really rigorous aside to this thread.....During pledge night the other night on the public channel, there was an"economist" who gave an hour or so presentation.  His data was predictiveand based largely on population data. I don't know his name, but hisarguments were brilliant.  He confirmed, with data, what many of us knowwith common sense -- the boom of the 80's has nothing to do with governmentpolicy, particularly "supply side" policy, since taxes do not "cause" economic activities.  People cause economic activity.  More can be explained by watching population waves roll through the years and create cycles.  He has made models and predictions for years well intothe middle of next century.  It will be neat to see how accurate heis.Paul Collacchi

And with gay men, where both partners can prove statusthrough their constant verility then you are going to get a situationwhere there is a lot of sex.The difference is between het sex being rationed as a valuable commodityand gay sex being virtually unlimited due to the *appetites* of men.Straights suffer a bottle neck where women are concerned, gay men whodo not experience this bottle neck go to excess.>-- >Mark Walsh (walsh@optilink) -- UUCP: uunet!optilink!walshXavier

But the "values and systems that make the rich rich" all basically  amount to freedom of choice.   In New England in 1800 the entire economy was based on the small family  farm.   Farm economy households were economically diversified, producing  not only agricultural goods but also "manufactured" goods, especially   cloth.  Many farm women carded, spun, and/or wove, producing not only  cloth for their own family but also to sell, generating extra income.  But about this time the Industrial Revolution was underway in England  and by the 1820's it had moved to the US, in both cases in the form   of textile mills.  These mills could produce cloth far more efficiently  and cheaply than people at home.    The result was that an important source of home income was wiped out  and many of these women were compelled by economic circumstance to   go to work in these same mills in Lowell, Mass, or Nashua, NH, where  they worked 73 hour weeks in deafening, dangerous conditions, living   regimented lives and being exposed to cotton-dust and infectious dis-  eases due to the work.  Now people didn't *HAVE* to buy the cheaper factory-made cloth.   They were free to keep buying the home-made variety and support  their local economy . . . > Things are designed in such a way that in order to go with the system>and make money, everything ELSE we care about goes to shit.  . . . but (sorry for the cliche), "it takes two to tango".   The big  rich corporations achieved that wealth because we buy their stuff.  It used to be the case that the business center of a town was also   its social center.  You KNEW the merchants you did business with   or even local kids working behind the counter.   You would see  people on the street whom you knew and you could stop for a chat.  Nowadays local merchants are going out of business and people shop   at huge anonymous malls serving regional populations of hundreds of  thousands or millions.  You have no particular relationship with the  companies you do business with, and feel no particular commitment  to them, nor they to you.   Major components of what defines a "com-  munity" have been destroyed.   On the other hand the products we buy  at these malls are a lot cheaper due to economies of scale and foreign  manufacture, and they are probably of better, or at least more consistent,  quality.>                                                           I have to>constantly remind myself that the goal of human society is not to make>money.

The media has proven itself very accurateis the areas of presenting raw, undisputed data.  One goodexample would be the weather page in which high and lowtemperatures of the previous day for a large number oflocations are posting.  There is little evidence to showthat they are in error.The American media has failed us in its analysis of complexevents, however.  I'm sure that we can come up with manynews stories that have left us angry because so many factshave been ommitted.  Cases that come to mind are theinvasion of Panama, the war with Iraq, the disaster in Waco,the issues surrounding the acceptance of gays into themilitary, the war on drugs, and many others.The story that you bring to light was regarding the newsex survey.  While I'm sure that due to lazyness some ofthe data was ommitted from the article, I would venture toguess that the data that was presented did not deviatefrom the survey.  I do, however, think that it would befolly to have blind faith in a single newswriter'sanalysis of this data.  In this particular case, there waslittle analysis, and the reader was left to draw his/herown convictions.Many netters, Mr. Cramer included, often forget that theAmerican media are merely a number of businesses, who'spurpose in life is to make money for their owners andstockholders.  Revenues come largely from advertiserswho merely want maximum useful exposure per dollar.

EDT               THE PRESIDENT:  Terry, do you have a question?          Q  Mr. President, there's a growing feeling that the Western response to bloodshed in Bosnia has been woefully inadequate.  Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel asked you yesterday to do something, anything to stop the fighting.  Is the United States considering taking unilateral action such as air strikes against Serb artillery sites?          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first let me say, as you know, for more than a week now we have been seriously reviewing our options for further action.  And I want to say, too, let's look at the last three months.  Since I became President I have worked with our allies and we have tried to move forward, first on the no-fly zone, on enforcement of it, on the humanitarian airdrops, on the war crimes investigation, on getting the Bosnian Muslims involved in the peace process.  We have made some progress.  And now we have a very much tougher sanctions resolution.  And Leon Fuerth, who is the National Security Advisor to the Vice President, is in Europe now working on implementing that.  That is going to make a big difference to Serbia.          And we are reviewing other options.  I think we should act.  We should lead -- the United States should lead.  We have led for the last three months.  We have moved the coalition.  And to be fair, our allies in Europe have been willing to do their part.  And they have troops on the ground there.          But I do not think we should act alone, unilaterally, nor do I think we will have to.  And in the next several days I think we will finalize the extensive review which has been going on and which has taken a lot of my time, as well as the time of the administration, as it should have, over the last 10 days or so.  I think we'll finish that in the near future and then we'll have a policy and we'll announce it and everybody can evaluate it.          Q  Can I follow up?          THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.          Q  Do you see any parallel between the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and the Holocaust?          THE PRESIDENT:  I think the Holocaust is on a whole different level.  I think it is without precedent or peer in human history.  On the other hand, ethnic cleansing is the kind of inhumanity that the Holocaust took to the nth degree.  The idea of moving people around and abusing them and often killing them solely because of their ethnicity is an abhorrent thing.  And it is especially troublesome in that area where people of different ethnic groups live side by side for so long together.  And I think you have to stand up against it.  I think it's wrong.          We were talking today about all of the other troubles in that region.  I was happy to see the violence between the Croats and the Muslims in Bosnia subside this morning, and I think we're making progress on that front.  But what's going on with the Serbians and the ethnic cleansing is qualitatively different than the other conflicts, both within the former Yugoslavia and in other parts of the region.          Q  Mr. President, by any count, you have not had a good week in your presidency.  The tragedy in Waco, the defeat of your stimulus bill, the standoff in Bosnia.  What did you do wrong and what are you going to do differently?  How do you look at things?  Are you reassessing?  (Laughter.)          THE PRESIDENT:  I don't really believe that the situation in Bosnia -- it's not been a good week for the world, but I don't know that the administration could have made it different.          On the stimulus package, I'd like to put it into the larger context and remind you that in this 100 days we have already fundamentally changed the direction of an American government.  We have abandoned trickle-down economics.  We've abandoned the policies that brought the debt of this country from $1 trillion to $4 trillion in only a decade.            The budget plan, which passed the Congress, which will reduce the deficit and increase investment, has led to a 20-year low in mortgage rates, dramatically lower interest rates.  There are probably people in this room who have refinanced their home mortgages in the last three months, or who have had access to cheaper credit.  That's going to put tens of billion dollars coursing throughout this economy in ways that are very, very good for the country.  And so we are moving in the right direction economically.          I regret that the stimulus did not pass, and I have begun to ask -- and will continue to ask not only people in the administration, but people in the Congress whether there is something I could have done differently to pass that.  Part of the reason it didn't pass was politics; part of it was a difference in ideas.  There are really people still who believe that it's not needed.  I just disagree with that.            I think the recovery -- the economists say it's been underway for about two years, and we've still had 16 months of seven-percent unemployment, and all the wealthy countries are having trouble creating jobs.  So I think there was an idea base -- an argument there, that while we're waiting for the lower interest rates and the deficit reduction and the investments of the next four years to take effect, this sort of supplemental appropriation should go forward.          Now, I have to tell you, I did misgauge that because a majority of the Republican senators now sitting in the Senate voted for a similar stimulus when Ronald Reagan was President in 1983, and voted 28 times for regular supplemental appropriations like this.  I just misgauged it.  And I hope that I can learn something.  I've just been here 90 days.  And, you know, I was a Governor working with a contentious legislature for 12 years, and it took me a decade to get political reform there.  So it takes time  to change things.  But I basically feel very good about what's happened in the first 100 days with regard to the Congress.          Q  Waco --          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, with regard to Waco I don't have much to add to what I've already said.  I think it is a -- I want the situation looked into.  I want us to bring in people who have any insights to bear on that.  I think it's very important that the whole thing be thoroughly gone over.  But I still maintain what I said from the beginning, that the offender there was David Koresh.  And I do not think the United States government is responsible for the fact that a bunch of fanatics decided to kill themselves.  And I'm sorry that they killed their children.          Q  Mr. President, to follow up partly on Helen on your stimulus package and on your political approach to Capitol Hill, Ross Perot said today that you're playing games with the American people in your tax policy.  He was strongly critical of your stimulus package.  He said he's going to launch an advertising campaign against the North American Free Trade Agreement.  How are you going to handle his political criticism?  Will it complicate your efforts on the Hill with your economic plan?  And do you plan to repackage some of the things that have been in your stimulus program and try to resubmit them to the Hill?          THE PRESIDENT:  Let me answer that question first.  We're going to revisit all of that over the next few days.  I'm going to be talking to members of Congress and to others to see what we can do about that.  With regard to the economic plan, I must say I found that rather amazing.  I don't want to get into an argument with Mr. Perot.  I'll be interested to hear what his specifics are, but I would -- go back and read his book and his plan.  There's a remarkable convergence except that we have more specific budget cuts, we raise taxes less on the middle class and more on the wealthy.  But, otherwise, the plans are remarkably similar.            So I think it would be -- I'll be interested to see if maybe perhaps he's changed his position from his book last year and he has some new ideas to bring to bear.  I'll be glad to hear them.          Q  To follow up, sir, how do you plan to handle his political criticism?  He's launched a campaign against you.  Do you think you can sit back and just --          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I will ask you to apply the same level of scrutiny to him as you do to me.  And if he's changed his position from the positions he took in the campaign last year, then we need to know why and what his ideas are.  Maybe he's got some constructive ideas.            I think the American people have shown that they're very impatient with people who don't want to produce results.  And the one thing I think that everybody has figured out about me in the last -- even if they don't agree with what I do -- is that I want to get something done.  I just came here to try to change things.  I want to do things.  And I want to do things that help people's lives.  So my judgment is that if he makes a suggestion that is good, that is constructive, that takes us beyond some idea I've proposed that will change people's lives for the better, fine.  But I think that that ought to be the test that we apply to everyone who weighs into this debate and not just to the President.     Q  Mr. President, to go back to Bosnia for a minute.  You continue to insist that this has to be multilateral action, a criteria that seems to have hamstrung us when it comes to many options thus far and makes it look as if this is a state of paralysis.  The United States is the last remaining superpower.  Why is it not appropriate in this situation for the United States to act unilaterally?     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, the United States -- surely you would agree, that the United States, even as the last remaining superpower, has to act consistent with international law under some mandate of the United Nations.     Q  But you have a mandate and --     THE PRESIDENT:  They do, and that is one of the things that we have under review.  I haven't ruled out any option for action.  I would remind all of you, I have not ruled out any option, except that we have not discussed and we are not considering the introduction of American forces into continuing hostilities there.  We are not.       So we are reviewing other options.  But I also would remind you that, to be fair, our allies have had -- the French, the British and the Canadians -- have had troops on the ground there.  They have been justifiably worried about those.  But they have supported the airdrops, the toughening of the sanctions.  They welcomed the American delegation now in Europe, working on how to make these sanctions really work and really bite against Serbia.  And I can tell you that the other nations involved are also genuinely reassessing their position, and I would not rule out the fact that we can reach an agreement for a concerted action that goes beyond where we have been.  I don't have any criticism of the British, the French and others about that.          Q  Would that be military action?          Q  Mr. President, several of the leading lights in your administration, ranging from your FBI Director to your U.N. Ambassador, to your Deputy Budget Director to your Health Services Secretary, have issued statements in the last couple of weeks which are absolutely contradictory to some of the positions you've taken in your administration.  Why is that?  Are you losing your political grip?          THE PRESIDENT:  Give me an example.           Q  Example?  Judge Sessions said that there was no child abuse in Waco.  Madeleine Albright has said in this morning's newspapers, at least, that she favors air strikes in Bosnia.  All of these are things you said that you didn't support.          THE PRESIDENT:  First of all, I don't know what -- we know that David Koresh had sex with children.  I think that is undisputed, is it not?  Is it not?  Does anybody dispute that?  Where I come from that qualifies as child abuse.  And we know that he had people teaching these kids how to kill themselves.  I think that qualifies as abuse.  And I'm not criticizing Judge Sessions because I don't know exactly what he said.          In terms of Madeleine Albright, Madeleine Albright has made no public statement at all about air strikes.  There is a press report that she wrote me a confidential letter in which she expressed her -- or memo -- in which she expressed her views about the new direction we should take in response to my request to all the senior members of my administration to let me know what they thought we ought to do next.  And I have heard from her and from others about what they think we ought to do next.  And I'm not going to discuss the recommendations they made to me, but in the next few days when I make a decision about what to do, then I will announce what I'm going to do.  So I wouldn't say that either one of those examples qualifies speaking out of school.          Q  How about the Value Added Tax, Mr. President?          THE PRESIDENT:  What was that?          Q  The Value Added Tax -- Mrs. Rivlin and Miss Shalala both said that they thought that that was a good idea.          THE PRESIDENT:  I don't mind them saying they think it's a good idea.  There are all kinds of arguments for it on policy grounds.  That does not mean that we have decided to incorporate it in the health care debate.  No decision has been made on that.  And I have no objection to their expressing their views on that.  We've had a lot of people from business and labor come to us saying that they thought that tax would help make their particular industries more competitive in the global economy.  I took no -- that wasn't taking a line against an administration policy.          Q  Mr. President, a week ago a group of gay and lesbian representatives came out of a meeting with you and expressed in the most ringing terms, their confidence in your understanding of them and their political aspirations, and their belief that you would fulfill those aspirations.  Do you feel now that you will be able to meet their now enhanced expectations?          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don't know about that.  And I don't know what their -- it depends on what the expectations are.  But I'll tell you this:  I believe that this country's policies should be heavily biased in favor of nondiscrimination.  I believe when you tell people they can't do certain things in this country that other people can do, there ought to be an overwhelming and compelling reason for it.  I believe we need the services of all of our people, and I have said that consistently.  And not as a political proposition.  The first time this issue came up was in 1991 when I was in Boston.  I was just asked the question about it.          And I might add -- it's interesting that I have been attacked -- obviously, those who disagree with me here are primarily coming from the political right in America.  When I was Governor, I was attacked from the other direction for sticking up for the rights of religious fundamentalists to run their child care centers and to practice home schooling under appropriate safeguards.  I just have always had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect the rights of American individual citizens to live up to the fullest of their capacities, and I'm going to stick right with that.          Q  Are you concerned, sir, that you may have generated expectations on their end and criticism among others that has hamstrung your administration in the sense of far too great emphasis on this issue?          THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, but I have not placed a great deal of emphasis on it.  It's gotten a lot of emphasis in other quarters and in the press.  I've just simply taken my position and tried to see it through.  And that's what I do.  It doesn't take a lot of my time as President to say what I believe in and what I intend to do, and that's what I'll continue to do.          Q  Mr. President, getting back to the situation in Bosnia -- and we understand you haven't made any final decisions on new options previously considered unacceptable.  But the two most commonly heard options would be lifting the arms embargo to enable the Bosnian Muslims to defend themselves and to initiate some limited air strikes, perhaps, to cut off supply lines.  Without telling us your decision -- presumably, you haven't made any final decisions on those two options -- what are the pros and cons that are going through your mind right now and will weigh heavily on your final decision?            THE PRESIDENT:  I'm reluctant to get into this.  There are -- those are two of the options.  There are some other options that have been considered.  All have pluses and minuses; all have supporters and opponents within the administration and in the Congress, where, I would remind you, heavy consultations will be required to embark on any new policy.          I do believe that on the air strike issue, the pronouncements that General Powell has made generally about military action, apply there.  If you take action, if the United States takes action, we must have a clearly-defined objective that can be met.  We must be able to understand it and its limitations must be clear.  The United States is not, should not, become involved as a partisan in a war.            With regard to the lifting of the arms embargo, the question obviously there is if you widen the capacity of people to fight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace?  Will it lead to more bloodshed?  What kind of reaction can others have that would undermine the effectiveness of the policy?          But I think both of them deserve some serious consideration, along with some other options we have.          Q  Do you think that these people who are trying to get us into war in Bosnia are really remembering that we haven't taken care of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the last war and we couldn't take care of our prisoners and get them all home from Vietnam?   And now many of them are coming up with bills for treatment of Agent Orange.  How can we afford to go to any more of these wars?          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that's a good argument against the United States itself becoming involved as a belligerent in a war there.  But we are, after all, the world's only super power.  We do have to lead the world  and there is a very serious problem of systematic ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, which could have not only enormous further humanitarian consequences -- and goodness knows there have been many -- but also could have other practical consequences in other nearby regions where the same sorts of ethnic tensions exist.     Q  Did you make any kind of agreement with Boris Yeltsin to hold off either on air strikes or any kind of aggressive action against the Serbs until after Sunday?  And in general, how has his political situation affected your deliberation on Bosnia?     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I have not made any agreement, and he did not ask for that.  We never even discussed that, interestingly enough.  The Russians, I would remind you, in the middle of President Yeltsin's campaign, abstained from our attempt to get tougher sanctions through the United Nations in what I thought was the proper decision for them and one that the United States and, I'm sure, the rest of the free world very much appreciated.      Q  Do you wish, Mr. President, that you'd become more involved in the planning of the Waco operation?  And how would you handle that situation differently now?     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't think as a practical matter that the President should become involved in the planning of those kinds of things at that detail.  One of the things that I'm sure will come out when we look into this is -- the questions will be asked and answered, did all of us who up the line of command ask the questions we should have asked and get the answers we should have gotten?  And I look forward to that.  But at the time, I have to say, as I did before, the first thing I did after the ATF agents were killed, once we knew that the FBI was going to go in, was to ask that the military be consulted because of the quasi, as least, military nature of the conflict given the resources that Koresh had in his compound and their obvious willingness to use them.  And then on the day before the action, I asked the questions of the Attorney General which I have reported to you previously, and which at the time I thought were sufficient.  I have -- as I said, I'm sure -- I leave it to others to make the suggestions about whether there are other questions I should have asked.          Q  Mr. President, what is your assessment of Director Sessions' role in the Waco affair?  And have you made a decision on his future?  And if you haven't, will you give him a personal hearing before you do decide?          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I have no assessment of his role since I had no direct contact with him.  And I mean no negative or positive inference.  I have no assessment there.  I stand by what I said before about my general high regard for the FBI.  And I'm waiting for a recommendation from the Attorney General about what to do with the direction of the FBI.          Q  Mr. President, since you said that one side in Bosnia conflict represents inhumanity that the Holocaust carried to the nth degree, why do you then tell us that the United States cannot take a partisan view in this war?          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I said that the principle of ethnic cleansing is something we ought to stand up against.  That does not mean that the United States or the United Nations can enter a war, in effect, to redraw the lines, geographical lines of republics within what was Yugoslavia, or that that would ultimately be successful.          I think what the United States has to do is to try to figure out whether there is some way consistent with forcing the people to resolve their own difficulties we can stand up to and stop ethnic cleansing.  And that is obviously the difficulty we are wrestling with.  This is clearly the most difficult foreign policy problem we face, and that all of our allies face.  And if it were easy, I suppose it would have been solved before.  We have tried to do more in the last 90 days than was previously done.  It has clearly not been enough to stop the Serbian aggression, and  we are now looking at what else we can do.          Q  Yesterday you specifically criticized the Roosevelt administration for not having bombed the railroads to the concentration camps and things that were near military targets.  Aren't there steps like that that would not involve conflict --direct conflict or partisan belligerence that you might consider?          THE PRESIDENT:  There may be.  I would remind you that the circumstances were somewhat different.  We were then at war with Germany at the time and that's what made that whole incident so --series of incidents -- so perplexing.  But we have -- as I say, we've got all of our options under review.          Q  The diplomatic initiative on Haiti is on the verge of collapse.  What can you do to salvage it short of a full-scale military operation?          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you may know something I don't.  That's not what our people tell me.  I think Mr. Caputo and Ambassador Pezzullo have done together a good job.  The thing keeps going back and forth because of the people who are involved with the de facto government there.  It's obvious what their concerns are.  They were the same concerns that led to the ouster of Aristide in the first place, and President Aristide, we feel, should be restored to power.  We're working toward that.  I get a report on that -- we discuss it at least three times a week, and I'm convinced that we're going to prevail there and be successful.            I do believe that there's every reason to think that there will have to be some sort of multilateral presence to try to guarantee the security and the freedom from violence of people on both sides of the ledger while we try to establish the conditions of ongoing civilized society.  But I believe we're going to prevail there.          Q  Mr. President, would you care to make your assessment of the first 100 days before we make one for you?  (Laughter.)          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I'll say if -- I believe, first of all, we passed the budget resolution in record time.  That was the biggest issue.  That confirmed the direction of the administration and confirmed the commitments of the campaign that we could both bring the deficit down and increase investment, and that we could do it by specific spending cuts and by raising taxes, almost all of which come from the highest income people in this society --reversing a 12-year trend in which most of the tax burdens were borne by the middle class, whose incomes were going down when their taxes were going up, while the deficit went from $1 trillion to $4 trillion, the total national debt, and the deficit continued to go up.          We have a 20-year low in interest rates from mortgages. We have lower interest rates across the board.  We have tens of billions of dollars flooding back into this economy as people refinance their debt.            We have established a new environmental policy, which is dramatically different.  The Secretary of Education has worked with me and with others and with the governors to establish a new approach in education that focuses on tough standards, as well as increasing opportunity.  We have done an enormous amount of work on political reform, on campaign finance and lobbying reform.  And I have imposed tough ethics requirements on my own administration's officials.  These things are consistent with not only what I said I'd do in the campaign, but with turning the country around.  The Vice President is heading a task force which will literally change the way the federal government operates and make it much more responsive to the citizens of this country.            We are working on a whole range of other things.  The welfare reform initiative, to move people from welfare to work.  And, of course, a massive amount of work has been done on the health care issue, which is a huge economic and personal security problem for millions of Americans.            So I think it is amazing how much has been done.  More will be done.  We also passed the Family Leave bill.  A version of the motor voter bill -- that has not come out of conference back to me yet.  And everything has been passed except the stimulus program.  So I think we're doing fine and we're moving in the right direction.  I feel good about it.          Q  Sir, a follow-up.  Wouldn't you say, though, that one of your biggest initiatives, aid to Soviet Russia, is now practically finished -- if we can't pass a stimulus bill in our own country, how can we do it for them?          THE PRESIDENT:  Let me recast the question a little bit.  It's a good question -- (laughter) -- it's a good question, but to be fair we've got to recast it.  We have already -- the first round of aid to the Soviet -- to non-Soviet Russia, to a democratic Russia, is plainly going to go through, the first $1.6 billion.  The aid that we agreed with our partners in the G-7 to provide through the international financial institutions, which is a big dollar item, is plainly going to go through.  The question is, can we get any more aid for Russia that requires a new appropriation by the United States Congress?  And that is a question I think, Mary, that will be resolved in the weeks ahead, in part by what happens to the American workers and their jobs and their future.  I think the two things will be tied by many members of Congress.     Q  The tailhook report came out this morning, documenting horrendous and nearly-criminal conduct on the part of the Navy.  How much did you discuss the incident and what might be done about it with your nominee to be the Secretary of the Navy?     THE PRESIDENT:  First, let me comment a little on that.  The Inspector General's report details conduct which is wrong and which has no place in the armed services.  And I expect the report to be acted on in the appropriate way.  I also want to say to the American people and to all of you that the report should be taken for what it is, a very disturbing list of allegations which will have to be thoroughly examined.  It should not be taken as a general indictment of the United States Navy or of all the fine people who serve there.  It is very specific in its allegations, and it will be pursued.       The only thing I said to the Secretary-Designate of the Navy and the only thing I should have said to him, I think, is that I expected him to take the report and to do his duty.  And I believe he will do that.     Q  Mr. President, to back to Russia for just a minute.  The latest poll show that Mr. Yeltsin will probably win his vote of confidence.  But there seems to be a real toss-up on whether or not voters are going to endorse his economic reforms.       THE PRESIDENT:  I understand that.       Q  Can you live with a split -- (laughter) -- can you live with a split decision, though, or do you need both passed in order to then build support for Russian aid?     THE PRESIDENT:  I believe -- the answer to your question is, for the United States, the key question should be that which is posed to any democracy, which is who wins the election.  If he wins the election, if he is ratified by the Russian people to continue as their President, then I think we should do our best to work with him toward reform.          You know, we had a lot of other countries here for the Holocaust Museum dedication -- their leaders were here.  Leaders from Eastern Europe, leaders from at least one republic of the former Soviet Union; all of them having terrible economic challenges as they convert from a communist command and control economy to a market economy in a world where there's economic slowdown everywhere.  And in a world in which there's economic slowdown and difficulty, all leaders will have trouble having their policies be popular in a poll because they haven't produced the results that the people so earnestly yearn for.  You can understand that.            But if they have confidence in the leadership, I think that's all we can ask.  And the United States will -- if the Russian people ratify him as their President and stick with him then the United States will continue to work with him.  I think he is a genuine democrat -- small d -- and genuinely committed to reform.  I think that we should support that.     Q  Mr. President, Mr. Perot has come out strongly in what is perceived behind the line against a free trade agreement --NAFTA.  How hard are you going to fight for this free trade agreement and when do you expect to see it accomplished?          THE PRESIDENT:  I think we'll have the agreement ready in the fairly near future.  You know, our people are still working with the Mexican government and with the Canadians on the side agreements.  We're trying to work out what the environmental agreement will say, what the labor agreement will say, and then what the fairest way to deal with enforcement is.            The Mexicans say, and there is some merit to their position, that they're worried about transferring their sovereignty in enforcement to a multilateral commission.  Even in the United States, to be fair, we have some folks who are worried about that --about giving that up.  On the other hand, if we're going to have an environmental agreement and a labor standards agreement that means something, then there has to be ultimately some consequences for violating them.  So what we're trying to do is to agree on an approach which would say that if there is a pattern of violations --if you keep on violating it past a certain point -- maybe not an isolated incident, but a pattern of violation -- there is going to be some enforcement.  There must be consequences.  And we're working out the details of that.          But I still feel quite good about it.  And this is just an area where I disagree with Mr. Perot and with others.  I think that we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integrates more closely the Mexican economy and the American economy and leads us from there to Chile to other market economies in Latin America, and gives us a bigger world in which to trade.  I think that's the only way a rich country can grow richer.  If you look at what Japan and other countries in the Pacific are doing to reach out in their own region, it's a pretty good lesson to us that we had better worry about how to build those bridges in our own area.            So this is an idea battle.  You know, you've got a lot of questions and I want to answer them all, but let me say not every one of these things can be distilled simply into politics -- you know, who's for this and who's for that, and if this person is for this, somebody else has got to be for that.  A lot of these things honestly involved real debates over ideas, over who's right and wrong about the world toward which we're moving.  And the answers are not self-evident.  And one of the reasons that I wanted to run for President is I wanted to sort of open the floodgates for debating these ideas so that we could try to change in the appropriate way.  So I just have a difference of opinion.  I believe that the concept of NAFTA is sound, even though, as you know, I thought that the details needed to be improved.          Q  Mr. President, there was a tremendous flurry of interest earlier this month in the Russian document that purported to show that the Vietnamese had held back American prisoners.  General Vessey has now said publicly that while the document itself was authentic, he believes that it was incorrect.  Do you have a personal view at this point about that issue?  And more broadly, do you believe that, in fact, the Vietnamese did return all the American prisoners at the time of the Paris Peace Accord?          THE PRESIDENT:  First let me say, I saw General Vessey before he went to Vietnam and after he returned.  And I have a high regard for him and I appreciate his willingness to serve his country in this way.  As to whether the document had any basis in fact, let me say that the government of Vietnam was more forthcoming than it had been in the past and gave us some documents that would tend to undermine the validity of the Russian documents claim.          I do not know whether that is right or wrong.  We are having it basically evaluated at this time, and when we complete the evaluation, we'll tell you.  And, of course, we want to tell the families of those who were missing in action or who were POWs.  I think that we'll be able to make some progress in eliminating some of the questions about the outstanding cases as a result of this last interchange, but I cannot say that I'm fully satisfied that we know all that we need to know.  There are still some cases that we don't know the answer to.  But I do believe we're making some progress.  I was encouraged by the last trip.          Q  I'd like to follow up on that.  Before the U.S. normalizes relations, allows trade to go forward, do you have to be personally sure that every case has been resolved or would you be willing to go forward on the basis that while it may take years to resolve these cases, the Vietnamese have made sufficient offerings to us to confirm good faith?          THE PRESIDENT:  A lot of experts say you can never resolve every case, every one, that we couldn't resolve all the cases for them and that there are still some cases that have not been factually resolved, going back to the Second World War.  But what I would have to be convinced of is that we had gone a long way toward resolving every case that could be resolved at this moment in time, and that there was a complete, open and unrestricted commitment to continue to do everything that could be done always to keep resolving those cases.  And we're not there yet.            Again, I have to be guided a little bit by people who know a lot about this.  And I confess to being much more heavily influenced by the families of the people whose lives were lost there, or whose lives remain in question than by the commercial interest and the other things which seem so compelling in this moment.  I just am very influenced by how the families feel.          Q     your economic stimulus package, are you doing some kind of reality check now and scaling back some of your plans, your legislative plans for the coming year, including the crime bill, the health care initiative and other things?  Are there any plans to do that?  And also, did you underestimate the power of Senator Bob Dole?          THE PRESIDENT:  No, what I underestimated was the extent to which what I thought was a fairly self-evident case, particularly after we stayed below the spending caps approved by this Congress, including the Republicans who were in this Congress last year -- when we had already passed a budget resolution which called for over $500 billion in deficit reduction.  When they had voted repeatedly for supplemental appropriations to help foreign governments, I thought at least four of them would vote to break cloture, and I underestimated that.  I did not have an adequate strategy of dealing with that.            I also thought that if I made a good-faith effort to negotiate and to compromise, that it would not be rebuffed.  Instead, every time I offered something they reduced the offer that they had previously been talking to the Majority Leader about.  So it was a strange set of events.  But I think what happened was what was a significant part of our plan, but not the major part of it, acquired a political connotation that got out of proportion to the merits, so that a lot of Republicans were saying to me privately, "Mr. President, I'd like to be for this, but I can't now.  And we're all strung out and we're divided."            And I think we need to do a reality check.  As I said, what I want to know -- let me go back to what I said -- what I want to know from our folks and from our friends in the Senate on -- and Republicans or Democrats -- is what could I have done differently to make it come out differently.  Because the real losers here were not the President and the administration.  The real losers were the hundreds of thousands of people who won't have jobs now.  We could have put another 700,000 kids to work this summer.  I mean, we could have done a lot of good things with that money.  And I think that is very, very sad.  And it became more political than it should have.  But the underlying rationale I don't think holds a lot of water --that it was deficit spending.  That just won't wash.          Q     and redo --          THE PRESIDENT:  No.  I mean, you know, for example --you mentioned the crime bill.  I think it would be a real mistake not to pass the crime bill.  I mean, the crime bill was almost on the point of passage last year.  And they were all fighting over the Brady Bill.  Surely, surely after what we have been through in this country just in the last three months, with the kind of mindless violence we have seen, we can pass a bill requiring people to go through a waiting period before they buy a handgun.  And surely we can see that we need more police officers on the street.            That's another thing that -- I really believe that once we move some of that money -- not all, but some of it up into this jobs package to make some of the jobs rehiring police officers on the street who'd been laid off, that would be a compelling case.  I mean people are scared in this country and I think we need to go forward. I feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime bill.          Q  Mr. President, back to the tailhook report for a second.  That report contained very strong criticism of the Navy's senior leadership in general, but did not name any of the senior officers.  Do you believe that the senior officers who are implicated in this, including Admiral Kelso who was there one night in Las Vegas, should they be disciplined and do you believe the public has a right to know the names of the senior officers?          THE PRESIDENT:  You should know that under the rules of law which apply to this, I am in the chain of command.  There is now an Inspector General's report and the law must take its course.  If I were to answer that question I might prejudice any decisions which might be later made in this case.  I don't really think -- I think all I can tell you is what I have already said.  I was very disturbed by the specific allegations in the Inspector General's report, and I want appropriate action to be taken.            Until the proper procedures have a chance to kick in and appropriate action is taken, I have been advised that because I am the Commander-in-Chief I have to be very careful about what I say so as not to prejudice the rights of anybody against whom any action might proceed or to prejudice the case in any other way either pro or con.  So I can't say any more except to say that I want this thing handled in an appropriate and thorough way.          Q  Mr. President, could I ask you for a clarification on Bosnia?  You said that you were not considering introduction of American forces.  Does that include any air forces as well as ground forces, sir?          THE PRESIDENT:  I said ground forces.          Q  You said ground forces.  Could I ask you, sir, if you fear that using U.S. air strikes might  draw the United States into a ground war there?          THE PRESIDENT:  I just don't want to discuss our evaluation of the options anymore.  I've told you that there's never been a serious discussion in this country about the introduction of ground forces into an ongoing conflict there.          Q  With hundreds of thousands of gays in Washington this weekend for the march, did you ever reconsider your decision to leave town for this weekend?  Did you ever consider in any way participating in some of the activities?           THE PRESIDENT:  No.          Q  Why not?          THE PRESIDENT:  Because I -- and, basically, I wouldn't participate in other marches.  I think once you become President, on balance, except under unusual circumstances, that is not what should be done.  But more importantly, I'm going to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, a trip that presumably most of you would want me to make, to try to focus anew on what I think are the fundamental issues at stake for our country right now.  And I expect that I will say something about the fact that a lot of Americans have come here, asking for a climate that is free of discrimination; asking, basically, to be able to work hard and live by the rules and be treated like other American citizens if they do that, and just that.  And that's always been my position -- not only for the gays who will be here, but for others as well.            Thank you very much.                                 END1:48 P.M. EDT

Ipser, Jr., 1993>Here's my own top ten response to Mr. Ipser's list10.  It's about time we have a President that might actually stand up to the     military.  Our men and women in uniform must learn that the world does not     revolve around them, and that one of the things they're out there defending     is our right to be critical of them, even denounce them.9.   Let me explain something to you.  Environmental policy and industrial     policy MUST go hand in hand.  Our nation, and indeed, our planet cannot     afford to continue ignoring this as was done over the last twelve years.     Our industrial/environmental position has been downright SHAMEFUL! We     must have active government support of the key industries such as,     telecommunications, microelectronics, medical, biotech, and environmental     tech.  Meanwhile weed out old, inneficient, high-polution, industries     that are better left to other nations.  This will make us richer, help     produce new jobs, and help the environment.  To give credit where credit     is due, I heard a lot of this in a speech by Senator John Kerry (D-MA)     tonite.  In addition, it's time we get really, really serious about      issues like overpopulation, globabl warming, and ozone depletion.  The     planet on which we live should be our utmost priority!8.   It just so happens that that it takes money to make this country work,     to provide the services that people need, and to help solve the problems     that need to be solved.  Granted, some things can probably be done more     efficiently for less money, and should be.  But some things are going to     cost more money and I'm sick and tired of hearing everyone whining about     taxes all the time.  You want to live in my country, you pay your fair     share!7.   I can't believe what hypocrites people are when they ask people to give     up their lives for their country and then complain about taxes.  If you're     willing to send me off to die for some stupid obsession with fighting an     enemy which at best doesn't affect us and at worst really should be our     friend, then you have no right to tell me you shouldn't pay taxes!6.   Hey, I think the beaded curtains add a lovely 60's-esque touch!5.   Look, Canada, Europe, and Japan manage to provide health care for their     citizens (and, yes, basic health IS a human right which people are     entitled to).  If these nations aren't capitalist enough for you, then     I guess we've found something better than capitalism!  There is nothing     sacred about the capitalist system, and if something, be it socialism     or anything else, works better, then I say let capitalism die.4.   Make love, not War!3.   Contrary to popular belief, it is possible to be a male and a feminist     at the same time.  To discriminate against or to deny equal opportunity     to a MAJORITY of the population is just plain wrong, and trying to force     them into some sort of tradition role is even worse.  Women certainly      have as much to offer this world as men, and the day that gender     discrimination is finally broken it going to make all the revolutions of     the past few centuries seem like reform bills.  I look forward to it.2.   See number 10.1.   HEY MAN, ACADAMIA RULES!!            -Amar Chaudhary     Peace, Land, at Matzoh!

In 1838, the governor of Missouri,governor Boggs, issued his so-called "Mormon extermination order."  Theonly crime ("illegal activity") the Latter-day Saints had committed, wastheir religious affiliation, their anti-slave stance (Missouri stillallowed slave practices), and their growing numbers/influence in Missouri.I guess the Mormons "got what they deserved," because they refused to bowto the will of (corrupt and evil) secular authorities. This "disobedience"brought upon them persecution, murder, and finally forced expulsion fromtheir lands and settlements...In the 1850s, the so-called "Utah-War" was forced upon the early Mormonsettlers, and their "illegal activities" consisted no less in living astheir conscience dictated, and to be sovereign/independant in Utah's(or "Deseret Territory" as it was called at the time) constitutionaldaily affairs.  (In order to subdue this clear threat to the survival ofthe United States of America, an entire army under the command of GeneralJohnson (hence "Johnson's Army"), invaded the territory to "restore"Uncle Sam's law and order...)History has the uncanny ability to draw certain parallels between eventsthat might appear unrelated, but are very much the same in spirit andintent.  That same mob- or persecution-prone attitude is to be found inthis user-group: when we tried to organize "soc.religion.mormon" and/or"talk.religion.mormon," a whole bunch of "charitable" believers effectivelyblocked our intent to create a group to discuss topics related to Mormonismet al in an appropriate forum.  We really must be a "threat" to variousestablishments...  Frustrating our legitimate rights for proper representa-tion also belongs in the category of persecution.  It is ironic that thosewho oppose us, point to all kinds of "justifications" to do so, despitetheir claims of adhering to a gospel of love...In any regard, Mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities (andI don't even discuss how Uthan's were suckered into allowing part of theirlands in becoming nerve-gas and atomic bomb testing grounds...) is far frombeing trusted or righteous.  Have things really changed for the better?  Imay be a born cynic, but I have NO reason whatsoever that such has been thecase. In the early 1980s, I believe, the late President Kimball (lds churchleader), strongly protested federal attempts to locate the MX-"Peace Keeper"missile maze from being built in Utah (yet another "inspired" decision fromsecular authorities).  Fortunately, his opposition was influential enoughfor the feds to back off.Lest anyone believe I do not believe in government: I do, but NOT withoutquestioning the wisdom and constitutionality of their decisions andresolves.  The government's actions around the Mt. Carmel compound in Wacowas NOT wise, neither was it necessary.  David Koresh did NOT pose a greatthreat to the federal authorities or the security of this nation, and withJohn, I too wonder who or what's next...#|> We used to live in a country where everyone enjoyed the free exercise#|> of their rights to worship and bear arms.  Now we don't.##Does that include the right to murder little children?  How about killing#ATF officers?  I do not know much about the gun laws in Texas, but#Koresh's folks claimed to have grenades, grenade launchers, and rocket#launchers.  I am not sure that the NRA feels that this falls under#"right to bear arms."Who killed who?  What constitutional right did the ATF officers have toinvade upon private land and to force themselves into the compound?What REALLY caused the "murder" of the little children?  Could it be thatthe ATF/FBI presence has any bearing upon the events?  How would youinterpret the Mt. Masada events?  --Blame the Jews?  (What the heck didthe Romans do there anyway?  What business did the ATF/FBI has in Waco,Texas???)  The Branch Davidians NEVER posed any threat to society.David Koresh, no doubt, will be described as the "evil" guy (by theexecutioners), while the actions of all those "valiant and brave" officersmay have been "regrettable," but alas, "necessary" to serve some dubiouspublic/national interest. --I guess they are still figuring it out how tosell this one to the nation...#|> Of course, to Jews and Mormons this is just a broken record.

Says who? Why can mon & pop have FOA, but IBM be forced, and force isthe correct word here, to have REO? As purchase of IBM is voluntary, thenthere are very well defined procedures on how IBM chooses to do some thingsand chooses to do other things. Why not let those same procedures work foremployment policies?    >Similarly, if a landlord owns a number of apartment buildings    >in which he does not live, and which are managed by an    >independent management agency, then whose freedom of    >association are we protecting?

If the landlord and the tenant can't agree, then theyboth can cease from using each other's property.Suddenly, by arm waving, by magic, a landlord does not have FOA. And on whatbasis does the FOA of the landlord "disappear"?It seems that vague terms like "no contact with tenants" suffice.Well, I think FOA is one our most important rightts (in the top 2-3), and bygolly, if the State is going to make it suffer, I sure would like to see theheinous crime that justifies the removal of this right.I don't think "no contact" with the tenats is even a crime, much less somethingthat should cause severe interference with important rights.    >I suspect that the majority of the people in this country    >agree with my position on these extreme cases, particularly    >if they are presented in this manner.

I assume that when you say "publicly owned", you are talking about thosequasi-State companys that do NOT have shareholders.The companies on the Fortune 500, for example, are all privately owned. Theycan give you a list of all of their owners. They have no "anonymous",unknown to them, owners.    >By the way, the above analysis is based on the assumption    >that the right to freedom of association and the right to an    >equal opportunity are both fundamental human rights of equal    >importance.

And that is self-destructive of the whole argument, because itis based only on might makes right. Sort of like saying, "nobody has a rightto live", whereupon I whip out a gun and shoot you dead -- end of argument.-- There are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind ofenvironmental disaster. Weird, eh?These opinions are MINE, and you can't have 'em! (But I'll rent 'em cheap ...)

Geez, where have you been, Ryan?  I proposed this theory *months*ago.  Let's take it one step further, even.  If, as the surveys show,up to 33% of all men have *had* a homosexual encounter, then there mustbe an even *larger* percentage of people who have had homosexual eroticfantasies.  But if less than 10% of the population is gay, what can wesay about these people who don't identify as gay but have demonstratedgay potential.  Obviously, a large chunk of these people *chose* (or,more accurately, were forced to choose by force of religion and socialsanction) to put those feelings aside, to be heterosexual.   Obviously, Cramer and Kaldis fall into this category.   These people are the ones who are so hung up on "choice."Obviously, since *they chose*, everyone must have, and homosexuals arejust flaunting their "perversion" by choosing not to go along with whatsociety has dictated.   Of course, I'm that most awful of perverts.  I chose, I gleefullyadmit that I was heterosexual until I met the right man and *chose* toindulge in my homoerotic potential.  Take that!

How's that for an answer?  :-)Seriously, I believe that it depends on wether or not you aretalking about a governmental employer or not.  In this case, Ibelieve that there should be absolutely no discrimination,direct or indirect, period.  I feel this way not because it wouldoffend my moral sensibilities (which it of course would), butbecause the government is a coercive entity which we cannotescape.  It boggles my mind that in my lifetime, there were"whites only" drinking fountains in some parks, but no fountainsfor others, yet the taxes garnished to support those fountainscertainly were not applied to "whites only."  In essence, wecannot escape the coercive state.  Even Randy Weavers have to payproperty tax.  On the other hand, private employers are not amonopoly, and their businesses should be run by them, and not bythe government, unless they elect to turn their affairs over tothat government.#> Why?

But say I were to buya unit in another town, and have it managed by a third party.Let's say that I have a real aversion to Christians becauseof the stuff that they buy into hook line and sinker, andbecause of the lunatic schmucks that they try to get elected.I don't want any of those fish symbols hanging in the windowof a house that I own.

Would you admit to having had sex with other people at some considered abnormalrate (this applies to heterosexual men).  In fact, as one gay man and onestraight man put it, "men lie about the number of partners, because that'sthe thing to do"- our culture for the male almost requires this type ofresponse.  It may seem harmless and silly, but carries a large emotionaland mental price tag.I hear college male students everyday talking about their 'supposed' conquest.  They just have to look good to one another, at least in theireyes.  But also know that alot of this does go on, there are many collegemales (hetero) having a lot of sex with different partners.

Excellently put!Even as a libertarian, I have to admit government does do some things Ilike.  There is a beautiful performing arts complex in Ft.  Lauderdalethat was partially built with tax dollars (I don't know how much wasprivate and how much was stolen, I mean public) but it is beautiful andI enjoy it.  (Keep in mind, though, most of the people in the city willnever attend a single performance there, so they might feel differentlyabout having to help pay for it.)However, I have to disagree about it being desireable or efficient togive government intervention-power on a case-by-case basis.  In fact,we have a lot better luck maintaining our freedom of speech preciselybecause it is not decided on a case-by-case basis as much as otherissues.  Judges decide whether political speech is allowed on thesidewalk in front of the post office.  They do not try to decide justwhether pro-nazi, pro-choice, pro-life, or pro-tax political speechshould be allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office.  You canimagine the result if right to free speech was decided by the majorityon a case-by-case basis.Not so with economic issues.  Government does tell taxi-drivers exactlywhat they can charge, but not the bus lines or the lawyers.Just as it is not desireable to decide rights of free speech on acase-by-case basis, we should not decide rights to free enterprise on acase-by-case basis.There is hope that a government can be restricted from interferring withfree enterprise.  But there is no hope, in my opinion, of having agovernment that interferes with free enterprise in an "efficient"manner; I call it political market failure.Thus, if you value freedom and the abundance it produces, you have toswallow the "whole libertarian agenda."Roger Collins

That the US systemis based to a considerable degree on the UK model is pretty widely accepted.At the time there was no other major country with a representative body.The French plebicite had been suppressed for 140 years and its restorationeight years later would mark the start of the French revolution. After the UK system the major influences were the Dutch system and of coursethe classical systems. Nobody seriously suggests that Rome or Greece were models though because the political systems of both countries were acknowlegeddisasters. The main lesson learnt from Greece was that unless a federalstate was constructed a war would be inevitable. The Greek democracies werealways fighting amongst themselves which is how Rome managed to invade. Hadthe federal consitution been rejected the new Roman empire in the shape ofBritain would quite certainly have reabsorbed much of the colonies in duecourse. Moreover the states would have been at each others throats as soonas the Louisiana purchase situation arose during the Napoleonic period.Phill Hallam-Baker

It isclear that at least one of the survivors made the contradictory claim thatBD members had started the fire.>    BD's were not contemplating suecide, and there is no reason >    to believe they committed one.No reason?  How about these two:1.  Some of the survivors claimed that BD members poured fuel along thecorridors and set fire to it.  The speed at which the fire spreadis not inconsistent with this claim.2.  There was certainly a fire which killed most of the people in the compound.There is a very very good possibility that the FBI did not start thisfire.  This is a good reason to believe that the BD's did.3.  Even if the BD's were not contemplating suicide, it is very possible thatDavid Koresh was convinced (and thus convinced the others) that thiswas not suicide.  It was the fulfilment of a profecy of some sort.There are three possibilities other than the BD's self destruction:A.  They are not dead, but escaped via bunker,etc.  From reports of theinadequacies of the tunnels and the bodies found, I would rate thisas highly unlikely.B.  The fire was started by an FBI accident.  This is possible, but it would befoolish of us to declare this outright until more evidence can back it.Sure, it's possible that the armored vehicle knocked down a lanternwhich started the fire (why was there a lit lantern in the middle ofthe day near the edge of the complex?).  It's anecdotal evidence thathas been contradicted by other escapees.C.  The fire was started on purpose by the FBI.  This has been suggested bysome on the NET, and I would rate this possibility as utterlyludicrous.  This is what we in "sci.skeptic" would call an"extraordinary claim" and won't bother refuting unless someone givesany good evidence to back it up.So we are left with two reasonable possibilities.  That the fire was an FBIaccident and that the fire was started by the BD.  I find the latter morelikely based on the evidence I've seen so far.-- *Isaac Kuo (isaackuo@math.berkeley.edu)*       ___** _____/_o_\\_____*Twinkle, twinkle, little .sig,*(==(/_______\\)==)*Keep it less than 5 lines big.* \\==\\/     \\/==/

Since we are talking in theory and opinion, then I'll put in my $.02.First, a rebuttle. Personally, I love under-dogs. Unlike bandwagon jumpers, I abandon teams when they start winning. People thatcheer for winners just because they are winners are insecure people who areafraid to be associated with something negative.>The political implications are simple. If, as many socialists - and>Democrats - do, you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some >"equitable" way, then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a >loser to tell whose side you are on. That could be black women today, Asian>homosexuals tommorrow, and yes indeed, white men some yet to be determined>day when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that (39%) >minority.On this one point, I agree. The reason that people bash WASP's is because they have been on top for a long time. Whoever is on top isgoing to oppress whoever is below them so that they can stay on top.If Hannibal had pushed on to Rome after his victory at Cannae we mightall be bashing the blacks for oppressing us peacefull white people for all these centuries. I seriously doubt that if the blacks had conquered the world that they would have treated their colonies anybetter/worse than the whites did.The white race did some unspeakable things to the other races ofthe world. But they only did what any other conquering race would have done(ie. Khan). The real question is, should we carry over that blame to thepresent generation who didn't participate in the crimes? Would it do any good? Has it done Bosnia any good? They are fighting wars that stoppedhundreds, even thousands, of years ago. My opinion is, if there are inequities now, then let's changethem. But don't blame me for what my ancestors did. It wouldn't settleanything anyway.>Either way you go, the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be>popular - at least after you graduate from High School (but you'll still>be popular at High School reunions). But it beats being a Nerd, as I >would imagine Michael Douglas would now agree, and in the long run, it>is the only way to go.That's where you are dead wrong. You don't join up on a side just becausethey are winning. That makes you spineless. Winning, in high school andafter high school, is still the best way to be popular, but it doesn't makeyou right. All the best causes in history were loosing causes (with onlya couple exceptions). Winning only makes a difference to other people, notto yourself. And what good is the opinions of other people if they only carehow you appear (ie. a Winner).If you can't beat them, fight them every inch of the way. >Bill R.------------------------------------------------------------------------------"At that moment the bottom fell out of Authur's mind.

Even if it were possible, I think it is a bad idea since it smacksreal strongly of double jeopardy.  A civil case for damages is fine since thatis a trial that would proceed regardless of the first.  I think a bad precedenthas already been set in the King trial in L.A. and something like this wouldmake it worse.  Regardless of how bad anybody feels about this decision, itmust stand that charges of assault were not not proven against the threemarines and that's how it should stand.Frank (who is still mad, but now somewhat sane)--------------------------------------------------------------------------Frank R.

The same liberals you areupset about are also passing laws that make tough background checks for childcarepeople.#3Tell me, how would you feel if your employer fired you for your antigay post on theinternet?  Would you be upset ?  I`ll bet you would be pissed!To some, your posts ,ight make the company look bad.While your posts offend me I dont think it would be right for you to get fired overit.I dont believe the gay comunity is asking for hiring quotas like the affirmativeaction laws of the 60's did.My understanding is that the gay community just wants the same rights the srtraightshave.  I dont think people should have their leases cancelled when their landlordfinds out they are gay.  I dont think that when someone sees someone walk out ofa gay business and then blabs it all over work that the gay person gets fired.Do you REALLY think these are justified ?#4Clayton, I am told you are a parent a couple times over.Have you been following the strip in the paper "For Better or For Worse" ?I honestly want your opinion as a parent on the strip.  Do you really care about your childerenas much as friends of mine tell me ?  How much do you care about your childeren ?How much do you care about other people's childeren?  Do you care about MY childeren?Do you care about my sister's childeren ?If one of your kids told you he/she was gay, would you throw them out of your homein the middle of the night?Would you approve of your childeren driving down to San Francisco to trow bottlesat and beat up on gay people?  Would you condone your childeren beating up on someoneelses childeren ?I await your answers to these queastions.  PLease no flaming...This is to be a civilised discussion, from one father to another.

Actually, the median *is* defined as the 50th percentile.

Are there a lot# less male homosexuals than there used to be or are men# (perhaps women too) not as honest as they used to be about# there sexuality?  Presumably, the people that were polled inYou mean, in the 1940s, men and women were much more open abouttheir homosexuality than today?  Want to try that one again?# this survey were assured of their anonymnity so they should# have answered the questions honestly I suppose.  However, it# could be that gays feel so repressed and denigrated by society# that they didn't feel that they could be forthcoming about there# sexuality in something like a survey.  If this true then is it# possible that there is a lot more gays out there than we are led# to believe?# # Perhaps if Americans were more open about there sexuality---I think# most Americans aren't---then we might discover that there are really# quite a few more people out there who are orientated toward the same# sex---men and women included.  I'd venture a guess that there is a# lot of people out there who have considered having a relationship# with someone of the same sex at some point in there life.  Maybe they# didn't take their longings seriously, but this doesn't make these# longings any less valid.  Therefore, if Americans weren't so# repressed about their sexuality in general---as I believe they may be# ---then we'd see a lot more people "coming out of the closet".You mean, ignore study after study, so that we can continue to accept a study (Kinsey's) that is obviously wrong?  # As for myself, I'm a heterosexual and I've never considered having# sex with another man.  That's just the way I am...I could have just# as easily of been gay I suppose.  One of the big debates about# homosexuality is whether or not it's a type of behavior that is# learned or if one is just born that way.  IMHO, the more likely# explanation is that it's some combination of the two.Based on what, besides your own warm fuzzy feelings?# Here's something to ponder upon:  have any of you gay-bashers out# there ever considered that homosexuals probably deem their sexual# orientation as being a state of affairs that is just as much an# intrinsic and "natural" part of their life as heterosexuals do# about their own sexuality?  In other words, someone who is *truly*Alcoholics share that feeling, until they hit bottom.# gay may not be able to live any other way.  Even if they date someone# of the opposite sex or get married, in their *heart* they are still a# homosexual.  Likewise, if someone who is *truly* heterosexual forms# a relationship with someone of the same sex, then they are *still*# a heterosexual even though outward appearances may suggest otherwise.# # Scott Kennedy,  Brewer and PatriotUnless, of course, the problem is that homosexuality is a formof mental disorder, caused by childhood sexual abuse, as a number ofrecent works suggest.If homosexuals would stop using the government to impose theirmorality on others (antidiscrimination laws) and leave our childrenalone, I wouldn't care in the least what they did in private.

The federal government has an interest inthe intent of the perpetrators in the pursuit of preventing violations ofcivil rights. It's the way they broke the back of the Klan, by putting alot of people away for a very long time for harrassing blacks specifically.It is a principle that has been well recognized as constitutionally validsince over 100 years ago. It has been used whenever a select group wasgetting bashed or harrassed more than any other person would just for beingpart of a minority. It is the only way we made the defeat of the southstick after the Civil War. People who harrassed free blacks, when normallythey wouldn't find themselves harrassing just anyone walking around wereexpeditiously tried and jailed for 5 to 8 years until nobody wanted to tryit anymore. Now with the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection underthe law, the law can use multiple crime and severe penalty involving intentas much as is needed to protect even one human that is a hated minority tosomebody. They can call out the national guard just for them, as they didthe school girls in Alabama during desegregation in the 1950's, and thepresident can nationalize the state militia and turn the guns of themilitia that were being used to bar blacks right around to point at thethousands in the crowd with an order to shoot that they would have to obeyor face possible death by firing squad under the Uniform Code of MilitaryJustice for failing to obey a direct order while under arms! And by god,they did! Those southern boys turned right around an fixed bayonets! Andthe governor was left standing and was arrested by the federal marshallsthat had brought the order to nationalize the guard. And that's why we needsuch an ability in federal jurisdiction.-RSW-- * Richard STEVEn Walz   rstevew@deeptht.armory.com   (408) 429-1200  ** 515 Maple Street #1   * Without safe and free abortion women are   ** Santa Cruz, CA 95060    organ-surrogates to unwanted parasites.*   ** Real Men would never accept organ-slavery and will protect Women.  *

I disagree.  The system is not too slow, it was simply designed tohandle less than it has demanded that it handle.

Congress is more than capable of quick action, and has more thanenough power and time on its hands, if it confined itself to what itsoriginal jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy.       It is not a case of the system of government they created failing,but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specificallywanted to avoid.  Namely, a concentration of power.

There is no limit in the Constitution to the President's veto powerregarding what a bill is for.

Why is it not a reasonable restriction?  Because 51 Senatorsis the magic holy number upon which Laws must be based?  If 41 Senatorsfeel safe enough with their state constituencies to stand up and fillibuster isn't that *enough* to indicate there's a sufficient questionas to whether a law is a good idea or not to re-evaluate it?       Why one earth *should* 51% be sufficient to enact a law whichcovers 250 million people in very, very diverse places and livingin radically different conditions?  Why *shouldn't* a super-majoritybe required?       Any system in which the simple majority is given absolute powerto ignore the minority then the minority *will* be ignored.  I do notsee this as a positive thing.

Isit because too many people take French and German in college to makethe accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance.Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat whenthe fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctorswere just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strengthrather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socializedmedicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service.>"`You've got to remember, you've got a waiting list as well, but it's  >not as obvious.

For non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover whycertain procedures are in scarcer demand.  I have MD friends who can'tmake a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurancerates but because they won't get enough customers -- the CMA medicalmonopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so theymust move to larger places.  However, this does not refute debunkingof waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in theU.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. DennisE. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada'shealth insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is onesmall error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.>WOULDN'T NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE MEAN THAT AMERICANS WHO ARE NOW  >FULLY INSURED MIGHT HAVE TO SETTLE FOR LESS?  >>In Canada, provincial insurance covers all health costs except dental  >care, eyeglasses, prescription drugs, ambulance service, and private  >hospital rooms, -- so many Canadians do end up buying some private  >insurance. A policy to cover all of these things runs about #40 to $40  >a month.  Of course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germanycase, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the publicsector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extrainsurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. wardaccomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personalbenefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to becovered for basic care.At that point, they wouldn't even consider a "voucher" approachto broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make upthe difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.>******************************************************************  >>WOULDN'T FREE CARE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO RUN TO THE DOCTOR FOR EVERY  >ACHE AND PAIN?  >>People who get free treatment *do* go to the doctor and hospital about  >a third more often than those who have to pay a share of their medical  >bills.  >>Still, Canadians -- who pay nothing at the doctor's -- have a lower  >per-person health bill than we do.It is "free" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (twothings which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more likereal health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that whenworking in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was payingfor health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on mypay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but onlyannually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscalnaifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the Canadian Left forthat is part of their brainwashing agenda.The French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine's Summer 1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurancecoverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100%afterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a privatehospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospitalrate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the samecash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paidout-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So,the other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, notgleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public andprivate expenditures for total outlay using the same methods thatyield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.>ISN'T THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY JUST TOO BIG  >AND POWERFUL TO KILL?  >>Dismantling the health segment of our insurance industry would be  >"politically thorny," in the quiet words of one advocate for a  >national plan.

You can opt out in Canadaand Germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result becausethere are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.When private insurance realized how much money they'd make without therisks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxeamenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set onthe fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to patthemselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebeclast spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned againstany thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province'spublic health insurance plan.gld--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Gary L.

Hello, my friends, this is Dr. Beter.  Today is April 30,1982, and this is my AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 74.  It's now been almost one month since war broke out in the SouthAtlantic.  On the surface it seems that it's only a disputebetween Argentina and Great Britain over the barren, wind-sweptFalkland Islands and South Georgia Island.  In reality, it's farmore than that.   The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of agiant military operation.  During this month of April 1982,fierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the SouthAtlantic but also in the South Pacific.  Up to now most of thehostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship onall sides.  But as I say these words, the naval war in theSouthern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface.   Beginning today, April 30, a total naval and air blockade ofthe Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun.  At the same time acounterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.   To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period oftime, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter iscoming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines areoverextended.  Having come this far, Her Majesty's navy cannotsimply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks timewithout drawing blood from Argentina.  As a result the Britishwill be forced to undertake military operations very soon nomatter how risky they may be.   There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has nochoice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat.  Thatreason, my friends, is that the Royal Navy has already sufferedlosses in secret combat this month.  Up to this moment there willbe no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained bythe British fleet.  Only when publicly admitted fighting eruptswill the British dare to admit that they have suffered battlelosses.  To obtain that cover story, the British have no choicebut to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be riskingeven heavier losses on top of those already sustained.  In short,my friends, Her Majesty's navy has sailed into a trap.   The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange,ironic echoes of the past.  For weeks now we've been hearingcountless commentators referring to the British task force as an"armada" (quote).  The British of all people ought to be veryuneasy with that description.  The original Spanish Armada 400years ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force,but it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that itchanged the course of history--and it was none other than theEnglish navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada.   The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during thereign of England's Queen Elizabeth I.  The Armada was an invasionfleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England. They were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake.  Drakeand his small, fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armadaby changing the rules of battle.  The English fleet was equippedwith new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out ofreach.  From there the English pounded, smashed, and shatteredthe big ships of the mighty Armada.  When it was all over, barelyhalf the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port.  Drake'sdefeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world.  It openedthe door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start itsexpansion into a truly global empire.   Today, 400 years later, history seems to have come fullcircle.  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of theworld empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I, and nowthe cultures of England and of Spain are once again inconfrontation.  Once again a so-called armada is preparing forinvasion, but this time the armada is British, not Spanish.  Fourhundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day;today, the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene.   The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the DrakePassage around the southern tip of South America.  The defeat ofthe Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain'snaval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new British armada maywell break the back of what remains of the once glorious RoyalNavy.   My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are:Topic #1--THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLANDTopic #2--THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERETopic #3--THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR.Topic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this monthit looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century anda half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by GreatBritain.  During that entire time, British sovereignty over theFalklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have beencountless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which itcalls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothingin the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried aboutthem.   The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cubais from the United States, and they are not much of a prize. After 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewerthan 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short, theremote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over,and yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We arewatching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.   The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten allabout its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO'sdoorstep.  Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it'sgot at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers,submarines, assault ships--you name it.  Luxury cruise ships haveeven been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight. Wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activatedand sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships andsubmarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty andsent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40-ship force hasgrown steadily over the past several weeks into an armadanumbering over 70.  Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy hasalready been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.   Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What's thisfight really all about?  The most popular answer suggested in themajor media is "oil."  Vast deposits of oil are known to existunder the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands,but that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does itexplain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentinathis month, and oil explains even less about the Argentineseizure of South Georgia Island.   South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands withno known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to SouthGeorgia, the Falklands are an island paradise.  South GeorgiaIsland is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys,glaciers, and semi-permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable. On top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal orhistorical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect itstands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.   In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while byArgentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and tookover the Island.  For that and other historical reasons,Argentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina,not Britain.   But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  Ithas always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina orSpain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks evenmore unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentina'sleaders are military men and they think in military terms.  Theywere well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Islandcould not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they weresetting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Islandwas retaken by Britain.  So the question is: Why did Argentina'smilitary junta bother with the seemingly worthless South GeorgiaIsland at all?   My friends, the answers to all these questions are military,not political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses anenormous military secret.  It's a giant underground installationburied under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island. The real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secretinstallation, together with two other similar installations whichI will describe shortly.   The secret military complexes have been in existence for manyyears; they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclearwar timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here inWashington.  For the past two months I've been reporting thedetails of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtainand verify them.   The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September ofthis year 1982!!  It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threatthat caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now.   What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part ofthe Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war.  Themutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here--namely, theRockefeller cartel--and Russia's new rulers in the Kremlin arebehind the present crisis.  They are trying to ruin Phase #3 ofthe "PROJECT Z" war plan which I revealed last month.  That phaseis to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after bothRussia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WARONE.  As I mentioned last month, the key to this plan is theexistence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places aroundthe world.   The American Bolshevik military planners here in America areworking with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions ofother countries to set off war.  Having done that, they intend toride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy inGovernment war bunkers!  When the warring nations finally liesmoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shatteredremains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at thesecret weapons installations and bring their weapons into theopen.  They will confront the world with the only remainingfresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and usingthat military power, they will become the undisputed rulers ofthe world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan topave the way for world domination very soon by setting offNUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller carteland Russia's new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in arace against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.   Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here arebenefitting from war preparations which were started by theRockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years sincethe Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the UnitedStates Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the UnitedStates Government has been a house divided, torn by internalpower struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions. But before that, the United States had been dominated for decadesboth economically and politically by the Four RockefellerBrothers.   In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for worlddomination.  It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and halfsecret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28. It was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secretwhile appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all thedetails, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  Bydeliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled UnitedStates would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia. Then the secret weapons, including superweapons, would beunleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.   When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, theRockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by thelate 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early thatthe war being planned would have very different effects on theNorthern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers, the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the NorthernHemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--GreatBritain, France, Red China, and India.  By contrast, thestrategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere arerelatively few and far between.  In other words, it was expectedthat the coming nuclear war would be essentially a NorthernHemisphere war.   In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that seriousradioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areasnot initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far thewar clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there isvery little mixing between the air of the Northern and SouthernHemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet, cold air fromthe North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, thenit works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror imageof this process takes up the southern half of the planet. Northern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone,but very little of the air changes places.   The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the comingnuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere forgenerations to come; but if the calculations are right, theSouthern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war. This was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  Aquick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefellercartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As Idiscussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, NelsonRockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America duringthe war.  He accomplished this as so-called "Coordinator ofHemispheric Defense" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt. So that takes care of the South American continent and itsnatural resources.   Then there is the African continent.  There, too, Rockefellercontrol was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa,especially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to theefforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTERNo. 36.   Looking around the globe, the most important remaining landmasses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia andNew Zealand.  Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to theRockefellers.   The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret militaryinstallations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the comingwar.  By this means they expected to become the masters of thesurviving southern half of planet Earth after the NorthernHemisphere war.  Then, as the Northern Hemisphere graduallyrecovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empirewould be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the thirdgeneration Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty toinherit the Earth.   In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily afterthe war, some means would have to be available to projectmilitary power onto any land mass.  For example, revolts againstRockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from thebeam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwarmilitary domination of the world was found to be a navy.  Aminimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one basedin the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific.  Since thereserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after theNorthern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built inexisting shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be builtand they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is nosmall task; they take up a lot of space.  On top of that, it wasessential that the ships remain hidden after they were built. The best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard andnaval base into one over-all secret installation.  Finally, thesecret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclearattack; otherwise if its existence were ever discoveredprematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.   The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protectionagainst attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while allthese plans were still in the early stages of development, theanswer presented itself.  During a so-called banking trip toSweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hiddennaval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffswhich come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port isa gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed offwith enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the watera huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.   The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decidedthat a bigger, more secret, better protected version of theSwedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey ofcandidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey coveredcoastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areaswere rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong. Other areas were rejected because they were too close to theequator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were toomany people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecyimpossible.  Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen forthe secret naval installations be totally secure politically.   At last the sites for the secret naval installations wereselected.  In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand wasselected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71three months ago when I called attention to New Zealand's extremeimportance in the coming war.   In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealandnaval installation had to be divided up into two sites locatedclose together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of SouthIsland where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comesdown virtually to the water's edge.  The other part of theinstallation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island,which is off the tip of South Island.  The Stewart Islandfacility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem.   The New Zealand location met all the requirements.  Ever sinceWorld War II the government of New Zealand has been tied evencloser to the United States than to Great Britain.  The locationis far from the equator, and the installations are buried deepunder mountains, protected from nuclear attack.  They are alsotoo deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the NewZealand site is well situated to command the entire SouthPacific.   In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found. That site, my friends, is South Georgia Island.  It is locatedperfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic.  Thetall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secretinstallation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island. It is controlled by Great Britain whose government, like that ofNew Zealand, was willing to cooperate; and South Georgia Islandwas virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on thenortheast coast.  The whaling station was some 50 miles away fromthe secret new installation which was being built, but Britaintook no chances.  In 1965 the whaling station was closed down. Since that time there have been no inhabitants on South GeorgiaIsland except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists.   Construction of the secret naval facilities--two in NewZealand, one on South Georgia Island--began in the early 1960's. The techniques were adapted from those used previously to buildother large underground facilities, such as the NORADinstallation inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; however thesetechniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieveconstruction access directly from the sea instead of overland. In this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed inappearance both during and after construction.   The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to letships in and out were kept as small as possible and were wellcamouflaged.  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement, theentrances to the secret installations can be sealed up.  Whensealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless youknow exactly where it is; and unlike most large constructionprojects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lyingaround to attract attention.  The man-made caverns which housethe secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock anddebris was disposed of at sea.   Once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to beoutfitted for ship construction and docksite storage.  The fakedisarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributedgreatly to this task.  From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotalrole in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme.  He was then-Secretaryof Defense Robert McNamara.  All through the 60's McNamarapresided over the public paring back of America's visiblemilitary power.  This included the closing down and dismantlingof entire shipyards.  What we were not told was where all thatshipyard equipment went afterwards.  Where it went, my friends,was to the new secret installations which were being outfitted inNew Zealand and South Georgia Island!   The secret naval installations have been used as duplicationfacilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed andbuilt here in the United States.  As Defense Secretary CasparWeinberger told Congress recently, it is cheaper to build twoships at a time.  That is especially true if the second ship isan exact duplicate of the first.  This has become even more truein recent years through the use of computerized manufacturingtechniques.   The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secretinstallations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates ofcertain other ships and submarines.  They are all nuclearpowered--nuclear "subs"; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers;and yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them.  A secret twinwas built for the U.S.S. Nimitz, for the U.S.S. Eisenhower, andfor the newly-launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent.  All have beenfinanced through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that weconstantly hear about in the Defense Department; and all threecarriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraftwhose manufacture was financed the same way!   The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets areall duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels.  Even so, thesecret naval ships possess one key difference.   Last month I revealed that the so-called "Stealth Program" hassucceeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibilityshield.  This technique makes an object invisible from a distanceby distorting light waves in its vicinity.   A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going intocrash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all ofthe secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already beenoutfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment!  The Stealthprinciple is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanesbecause there is more room for the powerful equipment thatgenerates the field.   After NUCLEAR WAR ONE, the secret Stealth navy of the AmericanBolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left onearth.  It would be perfect for the intended role of worlddomination.  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, myfriends, but three years ago they lost control of the UnitedStates Military.  Now it's the American Bolsheviks who are incontrol, and they are bent on war.   These secret naval installations have precipitated what isbeing called the "Falklands crisis."Topic #2--In AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 73 last month I described"PROJECT Z", the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEARWAR ONE.   An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners hereare flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here inWashington.  It's a plan by which the United States will strikethe first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear warwith Russia.   Having set off the holocaust, the Bolsheviks here and incertain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortablewar bunkers.  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out instalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the UnitedStates and her allies.  Activating Phase #3 of their grandstrategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especiallytheir secret naval fleets.  With these they plan to conquer andrule what is left of the world.  The United States as we know itwill be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviksthemselves, this outcome will constitute victory.   Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed twomonths ago is still on track.  They are still shooting fornuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982!  Time isfast running out.   The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can towardwar; but, my friends, the Bolsheviks are not the only runners inthis race.  They have two deadly enemies, both of whom areequally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks.  One enemy of theBolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is thenew anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia; and now these twomutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts incertain ways.   In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that alimited, new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works betweenthe Rockefeller cartel and the Russians.  The January 26 meetingbetween Haig and Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland, was a turningpoint in the formation of this coalition.  It is now a reality,and is responsible for the so-called "Falkland crisis" nowdominating the headlines.  It should be emphasized that this newrelationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls farshort of a true alliance.  They have very major disputes to besettled between them, but for the time being they have called atruce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadlyenemy--the Bolsheviks here in America.   The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is toslow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war. If they can do that, time is on the side of the Rockefellercartel in certain political movements which I discussed lastsummer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67.  A slow-down in the nuclear wartimetable will also give more breathing space for additionalanti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented.   The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-Februarythat military action against the Bolsheviks was essential veryquickly.  No other type of action had any hope of taking effectfast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.   The exact details of the "PROJECT Z" war plan are not known toeither the Rockefellers or the Russians, but the general outlinesare known to be as I described last month.   It was decided that military action should be devised thatwould undermine Phase #3 of the Bolshevik war plan--that is, theBolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in theSouthern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled.  By workingtogether, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able todevise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone. The Rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled thesebases, provided detailed Intelligence about the best way toattack them.  The Russians with their enormous military machineprovided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.   It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable bothsecret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to beattacked.  Survival intact of either fleet would leave theBolshevik war plan still workable.   Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assaulton the New Zealand facilities was out of the question.  There wasno combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military forcewhich could possibly keep an attack secret from the outsideworld.  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off thevery war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent.   But the situation in the South Atlantic was a differentmatter.  In a way, the greatest asset of South Georgia Island wasalso its Achilles' heel.  The extreme isolation which protectedthe secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert militaryassault feasible.  The key lay with Argentina and herlong-standing claims to the Falkland Islands.   As I mentioned in Topic #1, the Rockefeller cartel hasdominated all of Latin America for decades.  Cartel operativeswere sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the governmentmilitary junta there.  The historic dispute over the FalklandIslands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, toenable the South Georgia base to be attacked.  The Argentinegenerals were not told everything about the situation by anymeans, but they were told enough to make clear what they were todo.   As an inducement to cooperate, the Argentine leaders werepromised handsome rewards.  They were guaranteed that after theshooting was over, the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentinehands.  This guarantee included the promise of covert militaryassistance as needed against the Royal Navy.  And to bolster thetroubled Argentine economy, it was promised that the Rockefellercartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves.  Withthese combined promises of military glory and financial rewards,the Argentine military junta agreed to the plan.   On March 19 Argentina carried out Act #1 in the joint attackplan.  A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things,landed at the abandoned old whaling station on South GeorgiaIsland.  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the oldbuildings and cart them off to sell.  While they were at it theyalso raised the Argentine flag over the work-site.  The British,always nervous about South Georgia Island, promptly reacted asexpected.  The British Antarctic survey ship "Endurance" put 22Marines ashore.  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore downthe Argentine flag.   The incident provided the desired excuse for the ArgentineJunta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to aboil.  From time to time in the past, Argentina has claimed thatSouth Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administeredthat way by Britain.  That argument is very flimsy but it nowcame in very handy.  It was nothing new to hear this fromArgentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot.   During late March, Argentine military forces startedassembling for an assault on the Falklands.  "Nothing new",thought the British high command.  Argentina has carried outthreatening maneuvers in the past many times.  It was believedthat they were about to do it again; but on April 2 Argentineforces did the unexpected.  After many past false alarms, thistime they actually invaded and seized the Islands.  All Argentinepublic statements emphasized the long-standing historical claimsto the Falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the nextday a small Argentine force also seized far-off South GeorgiaIsland.  The force was so small that it gave the appearanceinitially that it was just a side show from Argentina's point ofview; however, the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines wereoverpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13alleged scientists.  That was the moment of payoff in the jointRockefeller-Russian attack plan.   Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentineforces, a special commando team got onto the Island undetected. Based on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base, theteam moved to a location on the mountain directly above thecavernous secret base.  Special high-speed drilling equipment wasset up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russianmembers concentrated on military defense.  By late that evening,April 3, the military high command in London finally learned whatwas really taking place.  The secret South Georgia base was underattack by virtually the only means possible.  The jointRockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through themountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside.  It was only amatter of time until their drill would break through the ceilingof the giant hidden naval base.  Once the hole was made, the nextstep was obvious.  The Rockefeller-Russian team would put aweapon of some kind through the hole.  The best guess was that itwould be a nerve gas.   The shock waves that went through the highest levels of theBritish government on the evening of April 3 can hardly bedescribed, my friends.  The Thatcher government, like theso-called Reagan Administration here in America, is Bolshevikcontrolled.  That's why Margaret Thatcher always says, "Me, too"any time the Reagan Administration says or does anything againstRussia.  Both governments are party to the secret nuclear warplan in complete betrayal of the people of their respectivecountries, and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discoveredthat their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble.   Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a navalarmada to sail for the South Atlantic.  Haste was the order ofthe day.  The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceedingaround the clock.  The best estimates were that the drillingwould break through into the roof of the naval base in aboutthree weeks, on or about April 24.  If help did not reach SouthGeorgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed.  Theforces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defendthemselves under the circumstances.  Their mighty naval shipswere ships in a bottle.  They did not dare open the bottle tosail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed withtactical and nuclear weapons.  To open the blast-proof entrancedoors would be suicide.   On April 5, just two days after South Georgia Island wasseized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports. The same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister.  Hewas forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted theRockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attackpreparations.   That same day, April 5, New Zealand, the home of the othersecret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with Argentina. The two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on "RedAlert."  As a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twinbase were ordered to sea.  Several surface ships were already atsea undergoing "sea trials", but that still left seven (7) majorships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of thenuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier.   On that busy day of April 5, Argentina's Foreign Minister,Costa Mendez, was at the United Nations in New York.  He wasalarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy. Costa Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances fromcertain officials.  He got them!   For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with storiesabout the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet whilenegotiations went on.  That, my friends, was only a cover story. The Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly aspossible toward South Georgia Island.  If the task force arrivedin time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely.  Theofficial stories about "slow movement" of the British armada wereintended to give a cushion of time for that battle.  If need be,the fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island,then it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on theannounced schedule.  In this way the crucial importance of SouthGeorgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved.   It was initially expected that advance elements of the Britishfleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within twoweeks.  That would have been soon enough to attack the jointRockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before itwas completed.  But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made ashambles of the plan.   Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingentleft Ascension Island early April 14, two days before it wasannounced officially.  Shortly after they did so, they ran intotrouble.  Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in ona single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault onSouth Georgia Island.  The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge andcombat information center of the ship with neutron radiation.  Inmoments the ship was without any command, its communications andradar silenced.  Then a Russian "sub" closed in and quicklyfinished off this key British ship with torpedoes.  It brokeapart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly.  So far as isknown, there were no survivors.   This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced tworesults, both important:First, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlanticby the British armada.  The task force had to be regrouped into aconfiguration better suited for an enroute defense, but that costvaluable time.  Public announcements from London about theprogress of the fleet reflected this slowdown.  The timetable forarrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretchingout longer and longer.  All this bought extra time for the jointcommando team on South Georgia Island.  The drilling continued.The other result of the sinking was equally important.  Word wasflashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possibleaction.  It was obvious that the Russian Navy was gettinginvolved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy couldbe in big trouble.  During the dead of night, early April 15, theseven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases insouthern New Zealand.  They deployed to a secret operationalheadquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeastof New Zealand.  Their electromagnetic shields were operating toprovide protection from attack.  These shields make it impossibleto communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as Iexplained last month; but once they arrived at the Antipodes, theStealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shieldedcommunication cables to the Island headquarters.  The Antipodesheadquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the SouthGeorgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip ofSouth America.  The deployment of the available ships of theSouth Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the jointRockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for.  The ships had beenflushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place inNew Zealand!   The British ship's sinking of April 14 was also followed byother events.  On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving outof port.  The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in BuenosAires.  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality hewas there as a General, dealing with Generals.  Haig is the topGovernmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel, as I haverevealed in the past.  He was making sure that the Argentines didnot get cold feet and back down at that critical moment.  Fourdays later, April 19, Haig left for Washington.  As he boardedhis plane, Haig somberly told reporters, "Time is running out." And so it was, my friends, for the secret South Georgia base.   The very next day, April 20, the drill broke through into thehollowed-out cavern of the naval base.  Bolshevik militaryanalysts in London had not expected that it could be completeduntil at least the following weekend.  The British fleet wasstill out of range.   The weapon which the commando team inserted down through thelong hole was a small, compact Russian neutron bomb.  When it wasdetonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, theeffects were devastating.  The intense radiation instantly killedeveryone inside the base.  Also the heat and blast effects of thebomb are believed to have damaged all the ships insidesufficiently to badly disable them.   Meanwhile, Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were convergingon the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islandsawaiting orders.  From a distance, the ships were invisible tothe eye due to their protective shields, which also protectagainst beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for thetactics which the Russians employed.   Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven shipsusing their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF. As I have reported in the past, there is no method known by whichPRF can be jammed.  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locationsof the ships to the attack submarines.  The "subs" were armedwith special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed toexplode on impact.  More sophisticated torpedoes would have beenthrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protectiveshield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise rightthrough each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode. Within 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven BolshevikStealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them wenttheir Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected fromaround the world.   The South Pacific action took place just after sunset localtime.  The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23. That evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in publicwith the new British Foreign Minister, Francis Pym.  Pym waswearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taughtalways to display in public.  But not Haig.  Haig was grinningfrom ear to ear, and no wonder.  The joint Rockefeller-Russianmilitary operation had been a brilliant success.  The secretBolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out,bottled up inside South Georgia Island; and the South Pacificfleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled.  Byworking together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had wonthe secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere.Topic #3--As I say these words, news reports give the impressionthat war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic, but the realwar in the Southern Hemisphere is already over.  What we arewatching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath.  Thataftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands.  They have beenpromised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war.   At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressingfor a public announcement that the United States will side withBritain.  As soon as that takes place, military action will heatup fast around the Falklands.  Britain has no choice but tofight.  She has already suffered casualties which cannot beexplained without a public battle; but by fighting, theBolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating andtragic defeat for the Royal Navy.   Meanwhile, the Rockefeller strategists here are nowconcentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign.  Onall sides now we are hearing about the so-called "nuclear freezemovement."  There are documentaries, articles, publicity of allkinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war.  In recentmonths, there have even been referenda popping up on electionballots dealing with the nuclear war issue.  Medical doctors arebanding together to warn the public about what would happen ifthere were a nuclear war.   We are being told that all this is just popping upspontaneously.  We are now 37 years into the nuclear age andnothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yetnow we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans havespontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time.  If youbelieve that, my friends, I give up.  Movements like this never,and I mean never, develop without leadership, organization, andmoney--and plenty of it.   What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relationsmachine at work.  As I've explained in the past, the Rockefellercartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place.  If itdoes, they will lose everything because they are not in aposition to control it.  Instead, the deadly enemies of theRockefeller cartel, the Bolsheviks here, will win out if there isa war; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything inits power to prevent a nuclear war.   The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefellercartel creates certain temporary common interests between themand Russia; but as Russia's new rulers know very well, this doesnot spring from any great moral perspective on the part of theRockefeller group.  It's purely a matter of practical necessityright now for the Rockefellers.   The Russians regard the United States as a house divided, andthey are exploiting that division by working in careful ways withthe Rockefellers.  Their first priority is to rid the world ofthe deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclearwar; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day ofreckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day.   The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objectivewith their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda.  That objective isrenewed power--and power that moves them closer to their olddream of WORLD GOVERNMENT.  The Bolsheviks here have unwittinglyprovided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwarcampaign.  Under Bolshevik control, the so-called ReaganAdministration has become so hawkish that it's scaring people. The Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize onthat latent fear as a tool of power.   These days the smell of war is in the air.  The Falklandscrisis is helping to make that more intense.  The Rockefellerpropaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument thatsurrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war.  A newsuper-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill thebill.  It will have teeth!  As presently envisioned, the neworganization will be based in Geneva, Switzerland.  The workingname, though this may be changed, is the "World NonproliferationCouncil."  The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth ofnuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will beto use fear--the fear of war--to control us all.                       LAST MINUTE SUMMARY   Now it's time for my Last Minute Summary.  In this AUDIOLETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the so-calledFalkland Islands crisis.  The crisis erupted because of secretBolshevik-controlled naval installations in the SouthernHemisphere.  These have been attacked by joint action of theRockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow downthe nuclear-war timetable.  The attacks were successful, but theresults remain to be seen.  One result, though, is that the RoyalNavy has now been drawn into a trap.  Britain's Waterloo at seamay well be at hand.   My friends, two factions are struggling for control over ourUnited States--the Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks.  Theydiffer in style but both seek to control us through fear.  If weare ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through thepower of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only hope.  As the Scripturetells us, our Lord "...has not given us the spirit of fear; butof power, of love, and of a sound mind."  We must learn to wagepeace.  As our Lord declared long ago, "Blessed are thepeacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God."   Until next month, God willing, this is Dr. Beter.  Thank you,and may God bless each and every one of you.

O'KeefeHARD BY THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT, within clear view of the JeffersonMemorial, an easy stroll down the Mall to the majestic Lincoln Memorial,has arisen, on some of the most hallowed territory of the United States ofAmerica, a costly and dangerous mistake.  On ground where no monument yetmarks countless sacrifices and unheralded achievements of Americans of allraces and creeds in the building and defense of this nation, sits today amassive and costly edifice, devoted above all to a contentious and falseversion of the ordeal in Europe during World War II, of non-Americanmembers of a minority, sectarian group.  Now, in the deceptive guise oftolerance, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum begins a propagandacampaign, financed through the unwitting largess of the American taxpayer,in the interests of Israel and its adherents in America.     How did the federal government allow the creation of such amonstrosity?  What is its meaning for American policy and for Americanvalues?  And what must the American people do to regain control of the landtheir servants in Washington handed over to a foreign interest and toestablish an enterprise thereon, whether a museum or otherwise, informed byand conducted according to American principles and interests?[Photograph captioned, "The five-story, $150 million US Holocaust MemorialMuseum in Washington, D.C. was built and is operated by a taxpayer-fundedfederal agency.  In the foreground is the museum's six-sided "Hall ofRemembrance."ORIGINS     In the late 1970s, during the presidency of James Earl "Jimmy" Carter,a propaganda campaign to promote the "Holocaust," the alleged systematicslaughter of some 6 million Jews by the Germans during World War II, wasorganized and carried out from Hollywood and New York. As Benjamin Meed, animportant functionary of the council which controls the Holocaust museum,wrote in 1990:                        Almost a dozen years ago, a new phenomena [sic] developed.  The     Holocaust was introduced into schools, colleges, and universities.     Television broadcast programs on the Holocaust and millions of     Americans watched them.  Soon, Americans took great interest in the     lessons of the Holocaust, its uniqueness and its universal message.(1)     Why the urgency of this campaign? Two factors were paramount:  first,the beginnings, more than three decades after the end of World War II, ofan objective scholarly assessment of the facts of the alleged German policyto exterminate European Jewry.(2)     Second, the need to justify Zionist theory and practice in the face ofunprecedented international resistance to Israeli intransigence (includingthe famous UN General Assembly Resolution which equated Zionism withracism), and to defend Israel's aggressive policy under the leadership ofthe former terrorist, Prime Minister Menachem Begin.(3)THE U.S. HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL COUNCIL     In 1978 President Carter, his administration beleaguered at home andabroad, succumbed to pressure from the new "Holocaust" lobby (and thusAmerica's influential Israel-first minority) by creating, through executiveorder, the President's Commission on the Holocaust.  Two years later, onOctober 7, 1988, Congress passed--unanimously--a law establishing theUnited States Holocaust Memorial Council, charged principally withconstructing and overseeing the operation of "a permanent living memorialto the victims of the holocaust" and with providing "for appropriate waysfor the Nation to commemorate the Days of Remembrance, as an annual,national, civic commemoration of the Holocaust..."(4)     A priceless tract of public land was turned over to the council, and,after years of costly delay (during which the U.S. Holocaust MemorialCouncil's budget swelled from $2.5 million to over $18 million a year), theU.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum has been completed and readied for openingon April 22, 1993.A SECTARIAN, ALIEN AGENDA     The Holocaust Memorial Council, besides soliciting tens of millions ofdollars in tax-deductible donations to finance the Holocaust museum, hasbusied itself with promoting an agenda of unalloyed support for minority,Zionist ends.     The membership of the council, a U.S. federal agency, has beenoverwhelmingly Jewish since its founding in 1980.  The council's twodifferent chairmen--Elie Wiesel and Harvey Meyerhoff--have both beencommitted to the support of the state of Israel, and the chairs of thecouncil's most important committees have been likewise Jewish and Zionist.     The chief fundraiser for the Holocaust museum, Miles Lerman, wasformerly American vice chairman for the State of Israel Bonds Organization,promoting tax-free investment in a country which receives by far thelargest amount of U.S. foreign aid per year.  Working the same wealthyJewish Americans he has long dealt with in his fundraising for Israel,Lerman has helped raise nearly $160 million in tax-deductiblecontributions.  The biggest donors have been rewarded by having variouscomponents of the museum named for them, e.g. the Wexler Learning Center.     Nor is erecting and operating the Holocaust Memorial Museum the onlyfunction with which the Holocaust Memorial Council has been charged.Another of its duties is to commemorate the Days of Remembrance for Victimsof the Holocaust, which Congress has raised to "an annual, national, civiccommemoration of the Holocaust."  Like the Israeli Yom Hashoah (Day of theHolocaust), on which they are based, the Days of Remembrance are datedaccording to the lunar Hebrew calendar, and thus like Passover or Chanukah,fluctuate from year to year. These foreign days of lamentation arecurrently celebrated, under the flag of the republic, to prayers and chantsin Hebrew, in governmental settings from the Capital Rotunda to city halls,across the land.  Need it be stated that no group of American victims ofpersecution, let alone another foreign group, enjoys any such federallymandated and tax-supported day, or days, of recognition?THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM'S ONE-SIDED "HISTORY"     Although the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council during its early yearsmade noises about recognizing the ordeals of non-Jews during World War II,by every indication from advance literature published by the council, theU.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum is relentlessly Judeocentric.  While,according to a preliminary ground plan of the permanent exhibit, here andthere are nods to non-Jewish groups oppressed by the German NationalSocialists (never to groups victimized by Germany's enemies, above all byStalin's USSR), the larger holocaust of World War II, which claimed anestimated 75 to 80 million lives around the world, is ignored in preferenceto the Jewish ordeal. Thus, to cite just one telling example, the museum's"Life before the Holocaust" exhibit refers strictly to *Jewish* life beforethe Holocaust.(5)     Where, in fact, non-Jews figure in the Museum, they figure largely asvillains: the Germans and their allies and collaborators; the WesternAllies, including America, who refused to accept a large immigration beforethe war; the American political and military leaders who refused toauthorize costly bombing raids on the Auschwitz "gas chambers."        RED LIBERATORS?     The museum's message that support for Jews is the sole measure ofdecency during World War II leads to anomalies which, in an American museumraised on ground hallowed to the principles of liberty on which thisrepublic is based, can only be called shocking.  That the victims of WorldWar II atrocities by the Allies--massacres such as the fire-bombing ofTokyo and Dresden, the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Sovietslaughter of their Polish prisoners at Katyn, the mass rapes carried out bythe Red Army at the war's end--receive no mention is deplorable.  But themuseum's treatment of the armed forces which defended Stalin's savageSoviet tyranny is nothing short of grotesque.     In the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, Communists appear only in theguise of "resistance fighters" and "liberators."  For example, thesubmachine gun and false papers of Samuel Weissberg, a Communist Partymember who rose to high rank in a Communist guerrilla group in NorthFrance, are on honored display, no less precious a relic than the standardheaps of shoes and hair, in the museum's permanent exhibit.(6)     Even more unsettling is the honor given to Stalin's notorious RedArmy, which compiled a bloody and shameful record of atrocities acrossEurope during, and after, the war.  As the U.S. Holocaust MemorialCouncil's newsletter fulsomely puts it, "Flags will hang in the museum tohonor the millions of Soviet soldiers who drove Nazi forces westward andwho were the first Allied forces to liberate and publicize the existence ofthe camps."  In the words of Council chairman Harvey Meyerhoff, thesemartial banners of the Red tyranny have a single association: "Much morethan simply wartime memorabilia, these military artifacts are a significantcontribution to memory, one that will remind future generations of thepivotal role Soviet forces played in defeating Nazism..."(7)     What must the millions of Americans originating or descending from theEuropean nations--Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, [former] Yugoslavia--for which the Red "military artifacts" symbolized invasion, tyranny,oppression and persecution of religion think as they see the fierce armiesof *their* persecutors hailed as "liberators"?ISRAEL IN THE MUSEUM     Just as one might guess from the circumstance that the museum'sdirector, Yeshayahu Weinberg, and the head of its "Learning Center,"Yechiam Halevy, were brought in from Israel, the museum's treatment of thestate of Israel is adulatory.  An emotive tribute to the founding of Israelis an integral part of the exhibition.  That the establishment of Israel,and its expansion in subsequent wars, has meant colonial occupation andoppression for millions of the land's native Palestinians, anddispossession and exile for millions more, goes unmentioned--anothergrotesquery in an American museum supposed to instruct in the dangers ofintolerance and disregard of human rights.  As for the momentouscollaboration between Hitler's German state and the Jewish Agency in the1930s, which through the Ha'avara Agreement enabled the transfer of vitalcapital and the influx of tens of thousands of highly skilled Jewishimmigrants to Palestine, that is passed over in utter silence.(8)"HISTORICAL CORRECTNESS"     The Holocaust Museum's skewed history is not simply a matter of one-sidedness and omission.  The museum has further committed itself to a fixedand final interpretation of the surprisingly scanty and sometimes suspectevidence for a German policy of annihilating European Jewry, largely in gaschambers, in numbers approaching 6 million.  This despite a considerablebody of research and scholarship that has arisen over the past two decadesin many lands, and which contests, by academic means, the substance of theHolocaust "extermination thesis."(9)     That the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council is aware of the work of therevisionists is clear: The council's literature is replete, not withsubstantive refutations of revisionist scholarship, but with slander andpolemic.  To cite one characteristic example, the _U.S. Holocaust MemorialMuseum Newsletter_ of May, 1992 featured a front-page attack on Holocaustrevisionism by Professor Deborah Lipstadt of Occidental College in whichthe author decried the revisionists for producing material that lookedscholarly, then lauded the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum as "among themost efficacious ways" of "combating this pernicious trend," *whileneglecting to specify a single error of revisionist scholarship.*(10)     The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council recognizes that there is ahistorical debate on the holocaust, but takes official notice of thedissenting position only to attack it.  That an American institution,supported by the taxes of all Americans, should commit itself to inflexiblehistorical orthodoxy--in the service of a single American minority--is anintolerable imposition on our First Amendment rights, as well as a mockeryof the Western, and American, ideal of objective scholarship.A CENTER FOR EDUCATION?     U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council Chairman Harvey Meyerhoff has stated:"The museum is primarily an educational institution."(11)  From thecouncil's own literature, however, it is clear what Meyerhoff means byeducation.  The "role-playing" for children as well as adults who visit themuseum (visitors are to be issued "identity cards" bearing the name andalleged fate of various Holocaust victims); the high-tech computer andvideo effects and the recordings of speech and music which augment themuseum's tendentiously described artifacts; and the museum's goal, asproclaimed by its Zionist fundraising chairman, Miles Lerman, of ensuringthat "Children in Dubuque, families in Tucson, and schoolteachers inAtlanta will learn the history and the lessons of Auschwitz as thoroughlyas they learn the history of their own communities"--all these show thatthe U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum is a *propaganda* enterprise that seeksto indoctrinate all Americans in a uniquely and partisanly Jewish (andZionist) version of not merely the past, but the present and thefuture.(12)THE AMERICAN RESPONSE     What is the American response to a partisan museum constructed in aplace solemnly consecrated to the heroes and the values of our republic, tobe lavishly operated with taxpayer dollars at a time when, even in ourcountry's capital, thousands sleep homeless in the shadow of our nationalmonuments?  What is the American response to an ambitious propaganda agendathat aims to impose a sectarian "Holocaust remembrance" in schools whereour children cannot pray, in town halls and federal buildings from whichthe religious symbols of the majority are banned in the name of freedom ofworship?     Over two centuries ago, Thomas Jefferson wrote: "To compel a man tofurnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which hedisbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical."(13)     Nearly 150 years ago, Abraham Lincoln said: "I insist that if there is*anything* which it is the duty of the *whole people* to never entrust toany hands but their own, that thing is the preservation and perpetuity oftheir own liberties and institutions."(14)     The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, and the council which runs it, asagencies of the government in which the American people is sovereign, mustbe removed from the special interest that now controls it.     The scope and purpose of the Museum must be expanded, from its presentone-sided emphasis on foreign Jewish sufferings, real and imagined, inEurope during the 1930s and 1940s to a compassionate yet realistic concernfor *all* victims, but above all for *American* victims, of historicinjustice.     The Museum must be made a place where Americans of every heritage, andscholars of every viewpoint, may gather, educate, and be educated, withoutaccusation and in the absence of propaganda.  Until it is, the men andwomen who founded and built and suffered and fought and died for America,of every race, nationality and creed, will rest uneasy.NOTES     1. _The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Newsletter_(Washington, D.C.), August, 1990, "Survivors Play Major Role inEstablishing the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum," p.1.

This fits in well with a report inthe New York Times from April 18, 1993:***********************************Scores of Girls in Egypt Faint in ClassroomsBy Chris HedgesCairo, April 17The khamseen, the blustery sandstorms that arrive every spring, havebrought with them not only the usual clouds of grit and dust but alsowhat the authorities describe as collective hysteria.Hundreds of teen-age girls have been fainting en masse in classrooms,breaking out in sobs and complaining of unpleasant smells and nausea.[...]"There is no clinical reason for it," said Dr. Ahmed Rashed at AgouzaHospital, where dozens of girls have been tested.  "It's justhysteria.  We have carried out blood tests, urine tests, every kind oftest we can think of and nothing has shown up."More than a thosand young girls between 12 and 18 have sufferedattacks in some 40 schools across the country since the first caseswere reported over two weeks ago.[...]Lawmakers and commentators have attributed the fainting to everythingfrom food posoning to a plot by unamed enemy agents to make Egyptianwomen infertile. Similar attacks have been reported from time to time through Europe.One was reported about a decade ago in the Israeli-Occupied GazaStrip. Islamic fundamentalist leaders have blamed the Israeli secret servicefor the spells.  "This is all the work of the Mossad," said a militantcleric in Imbaba, a Cairo slum.  "They are seeding capsules around thecountry that release something into the air that can't be detected.It has a special effect on the hormones of young girls.  It is part ofa plot to destroy Egypt."  [Where have seen this argument before?  Because there is no  evidence for the conspiracy, therefore it must be true...][...]Health Minister Ragheb Dewidar said that neither medical orenvironmental tests had found any contaminant and that the cause waspsychological.  "If one girl who is popular or a leader feels faintfor some reason," he said, "the others start believing that they aresuffering from the sypmtoms."But no one is taking the matter lightly.  Prime Minister Atef Sedkihas held regular mettings with Mr. Dewidar to discuss the attacks.Government officials say they are determined to bring the phenomenonto an end."Parents and teachers should fight against these rumors and accept theresults of our scientific analysis," Education Minister Hussein KamalBahadeen said.***********************************You can't make this stuff up.

EDT               SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you in the thousands of communities around the country that are taking part in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.          You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas Jefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he has been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education here in this great country.  The success of our democracy according to Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational system.          His philosophy of government, his belief in the importance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest here this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us President Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in the Chamber of Commerce studios.            Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for taking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite network and we welcome you here this evening.          Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.  And, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening also.          I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure many of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that you'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In Washington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.          I believe the President has a few words that he might want to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that at this time.  It's great to have you.          THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.          I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob Reich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making, along with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people from school to the work place.          I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts, recognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this economy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to work together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to make things happen.          This satellite town meeting is a good example of that kind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home state pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart Corporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I appreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all the rest of you.          I have tried as hard as I could to move toward constructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about this being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson believed in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in education; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and third, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.            If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this beautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful cherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change with changing times.          For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we can compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight --about what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless we do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in government, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase our investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the long run.          We also have to have people who can carry their load.  And in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven or eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system and continues into the work force where education must go on for a lifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can learn.          And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing we're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership between the Labor Department and the Education Department and the private sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that would create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many thousands that have a strong education component so our young people can be learning and working at the same time.          Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good place we can begin, I think, the discussion.          SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.          Each month we get together and talk about ways that all citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And tonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours can prepare students for this world of work.          This week, the Education Department and the Labor Department are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called Summer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.  The aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged areas of the country.            Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it somewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your words is that so important?          THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.  First of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may have had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want them to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may forget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year over the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already taught before.          Secondly, we want to help these young people progress, not only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is learning because we think that the best and most productive workers will have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to succeed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.          SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are disadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go into the next year, is really even greater.            Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs throughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this educational component of training.          SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr. Secretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer or for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with education is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people, for example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning geometry.  But when they actually are there building something or working on something, and they can see the exact and direct application of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a lot of young people -- just that sense of connection between education and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.  It's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of young people even beyond the summer.          SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.            Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship program, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it developing.          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why it's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade will not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people get in a high school diploma.            If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries of young people that had at least two years of good post-high school education was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not go up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because they weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their employers.          So we think America has a big economic interest in trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school but don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes two years of further training either in a community college, a vocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in this budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states and with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in a way that would be customized essentially by the business community, based on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could revolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and the earnings of American workers.          SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think you know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the people watching this program -- that the business community and educators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many of our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In fact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The people watching this program probably are the ones who are most directly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley and I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes already out there.          SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight about youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning  career academies.  And what features all those programs that deal with this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of these school-to-work programs might have that   are important?          SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and you and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much longer than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business community is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're doing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The Chamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these kinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've aimed to work very closely with the Chamber.          The business community is going to be actively engaged in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and helping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.          Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is one of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these players in a community come together and work together and cooperate together.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and the business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody is talking, but they're not really working together in a common strategy.          And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick, would be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic excellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a tracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to make it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be eligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year college, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're talking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation skills for on-the-job learning.          And again, those are the critical components.  It's already being done.          THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one point based on my personal experience at home -- the business community has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are the job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught, but also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort of partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the second-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and influence them.  So I think that's very important.          And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at the federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some funds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the quality of these programs, because that's really what's going to determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.          SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of course, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery program for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about long-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr. President, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the communities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be coming forth before too long.          THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I were both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.            I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals that the governors drafted, along with representatives of President Bush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in Congress that will actually define the things that the national government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the children of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those goals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school ready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school graduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are confident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are second to none in math and science; that are schools are safe, disciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took them out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of life-long learning in this country.          And each one of those goals there's a national role, a state role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector role.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is; and then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job is and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality that we need to meet.          It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.  Not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their money, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and partnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.          SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms of its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform efforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.          Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to the telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of course, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and I wonder if you would comment on that.          SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of our young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they don't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system of community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had national skill standards to which they could aspire and which employers would understand as a national credential, many of these young people would actually find that they were much more eligible for jobs.          Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to college, but you have a whole level of people who have certain technical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If you don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to develop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working with the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private industry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other institutions to rally around, as well as our business community.          SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go ahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce Todd of Austin, Texas.          Q  Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and Riley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who have heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me simply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with much of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are very supportive.            We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our summer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to have over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much as 3,500 with the federal assistance.            Much of the question that we had designed you have answered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But the question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day would be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round is even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year-round basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the local community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's something that we believe is very important to success in this effort.          SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.          THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to answer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling, and thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.  I've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.            First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer program and that will move a lot of these young people back into schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in the private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're working on that.          Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the Congress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to build in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job training programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give heavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you asked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being trained on a year-round basis.          And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said a moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen as work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people actually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when they're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and we hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget cuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue raisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be able to do just what you seem to want based on your question.          Bob, do you want to say anything?          SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out of my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing, and that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in addition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of jobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.  It's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the economy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything else.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I think this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or greater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going to be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything right, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.          SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000 will be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into next year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it will be -- action plans with every state where we can be working together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And then the state, with all the various school districts, a very important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I think everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that moving.          The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.            Doctor?          Q  Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to be on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school and work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since its inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two alternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages we have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an extremely effective learning strategy.          And over the years, we've come to believe that there are several principles that are very important in bridging the school and work.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with practice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure to careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and lastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the development of high performance competencies.            My question, then is:  How can the general education faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with transition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies can you suggest to achieve this integration?          SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think -- and we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting work going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next guests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists   in that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to them and we can discuss it later.          You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?          THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one thing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as clear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more explicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics is very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish what I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is vocational learning and what is academic learning.          I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think we should have a strong component for people who are in the vocational program.          SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to rethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and work combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're important for all students.  It's not just a special group of students that needs them.          Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United States -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream experiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and 12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience and then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on to college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they can go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and career directions.          But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often goes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work-related work within the classroom, within our schools.          SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's going to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I think you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank you and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and your ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.                                   END9:00 P.M. EDT

HEY MAN, ACADAMIA RULES!!Barf.You mean the same economic theorists who say things like "for the sakeof convenience in mathematical modeling we will first assume there isno wealth creation" now get a crack at implementing their PhD thesis inreal life?Go back to your textbooks on macroeconomic theory. Look in the first chapterof that book, introducing the field of macroeconomic theory. Right therein chapter 1, section 1, is a statement like the following:"As it is difficult to predict and model wealth creation,especially in an economy where wealth creation is inherentlythe province of individuals who create new inventions anddiscover new ideas, we will assume for the rest of thisbook that there is no wealth creation."We do not assume the lack of weath creation in the real world,however the mathematical modeling of such an inherentlyunpredictable subject is impossible. Even though we assumeno wealth creation, we do believe that for most mathematicaleconomic modeling such an assumption is reasonably validas it allows us to make predictions which then can be tested."So the guys who are running the store for Clinton and company are nowassuming that wealth creation does not exists. They are (borrowing anidea from the Hitchhiker's Guide) too advanced to think of these simplethings.To be honist, I would rather have an engineer with years of experiencebuilding bridges design the next bridge, rather than a theoreticalphysicists with a freshly minted PhD and no experience do the same job.- Bill WoodyNormally I don't post (or even read most of the postings) in this newsgroup.If you would like to reply to this message and want me to see the reply,then I guess you will just have to reply directly to me.

Reserve Officers Say Demographics Ignored in Nominations toClose Naval, Marine Reserve Centers To: National Desk, Defense Writer Contact: Herbert M. Hart of the Reserve Officers Association of          the United States, 202-479-2258   WASHINGTON, April 13 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The Reserve OfficersAssociation of the United States has alerted the Defense BaseRealignment and Closure Commission that the services failed to givesufficient weight to demographics in recommendations made to close56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve centers.   In letters to the closure commission and to all 86 members ofCongress with affected locations in their constituencies, includingSen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, ROA charged that the developers of the Navy-Marine listignored demographics of the civilian population, particularly priorservice personnel.   ROA's executive director, Maj. Gen. Evan L. Hultman, AUS (Ret.),suggested "concern that the only plausible alternative is that theyare intentionally attempting to foreclose the Naval Reservecomponents from maintaining even today's relatively low level ofparticipation in their parent service's Total Force of the future."   He asked the commission "to remove from consideration alllocations without sufficient and convincing demographic data towarrant approval of the requested action."   "Only a few of the 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserveinstallations on this list are large enough to have a significantimpact on the community, if closed," wrote Hultman.  "The majorissue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a largepercentage of the existing locations."   Hultman reminded the commission, "The fact that the vastmajority of the Reserve installations on this list do not comeclose to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in thisprocess certainly supports the thesis" that these actions aresimply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the Navy andMarine Corps Reserve.   ROA also noted "that at the end of the 1960s, when the number ofNaval Reservists was approximately the same as today, there were 480Naval Reserve facilities.  If the Navy recommendations areapproved, there will be less than 200 Naval Reserve facilities."

We know that certain Apostles had nicknames connecting them to>Jewish terrorist groups. For the average inhabitant of the Roman Empire>(especially after centuries of political instability and terror), the>Roman policies in Palestine were heartily approved of. When studied witha>knowledge of cult psychology, Acts is eerily familiar, especially today.1. The mother church did disappear at the time of the Roman attack. Jamesthe Just was judicially murdered a few years earlier, but there isevidence that the church survived him. There is no evidence that it stillexisted after the assault on the city. The individuals historicallyassociated with that church disappear at that time. 2. The followers of Jesus included a number of individuals whose nicknamessuggested connections with the Jewish terrorism of the time (Zealotes,Iscariot, "Sons of Thunder").3. For cult psychology, there's an extensive literature.4. For an understanding of the motivation of the members of the Jerusalemchurch, there is a mixed collection of sources. The Anchor Bible has someinteresting articles, but one thing I've noticed about biblicalscholarship is that intellectual honesty and a skeptical approach arenotably lacking. You basically have to spread your net wide and thenwinnow. (For example, Allegro and Schoenfeld have some interesting ideas,but they were both "over the top.") Many interesting ideas have not beenfollowed up, mostly due to religious reasons. What was the connection ofearly Christian theology to Samaritan dualism and proto-gnosticism? (SeeStephen's speech in Acts for a Samaritan interpretation of thecrucifixion.) Schweitzer's interpretation of Jesus's motivations could beupdated, especially now that we have the Essene and Chenoboskianmaterials. And so it goes. (For instance, the convincing statisticalevidence concerning the authorship of the Pauline materials has beencompletely ignored by biblical scholars.)I don't track this area much any more. (My coursework is 20 years old.) Ihave a personal theory that the synoptics were written in Syria during thecourse of the Jewish Revolt. I suspect Mark was written before the fall ofJerusalem as an apology to get the Romans and Roman-sympathizers off theback of the local Greek Christians. Matthew and Luke were written withsimilar goals, but incorporating additional materials.

Fante} \\endauthor\\date {April 20, 1993} \\enddate\\endtopmatterIn a letter to the FBI, David Koresh said: ``Do you want me topull back the heavens and show you my anger?! ... fear me.''  The 51 daystandoff between federal agents and the Branch Davidians ended on April 19in what appeared to be a mass suicide by fire.  Now that the multi-milliondollar standoff is over, a few things remain: cleaning up the mess, andassigning blame.\\From the onset of the April 19 tear gas attacks by federal agents, PresidentClinton already started passing the buck by saying ``Talk to the attorneygeneral or the FBI... I knew it was going to be done, but the decision was{\\it entirely theirs}.  {\\it They} made the tactical decision.'' EnterAttorney General Janet Reno.  After most of the Branch Davidians died,Reno said she took ``full responsibility'' for the decision.  ``I approvedthe plan'' she said adding that she ``did not advise him [Clinton] as to thedetails.''  In fact, she told Clinton that it was ``the best way to go.''As the fire was roaring through the Branch Davidian's compound Clinton saidthat he was ``deeply sadened by the loss of life'' and in the same breath that``the law enforcement agencies involved in the Waco siege recommended thecourse of action pursued today.''  Later he went on to say ``I stand by that[Reno's] decision.''\\How did this all begin?  At 0930 on February 28 agents of the Bureau ofAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) launched a full-scale, high-profileassault on the Branch Davidian's compound.  This raid was muchmore than an assault on a group suspected of possessing illegal weapons.  Theassault was a planned media circus used as a propaganda device of the BATFto show their might and just purpose.\\At the onset of the ``no-knock'' raid, gaggles of heavily armed BATF agentsmade their way inside the compound without identifying themselves or statethat they had a warrant until long after the shooting began.Silently, the agents made their way to the compound's buildings and startedtheir ``search'' by charging at the buildings and throwing concussion grenadesand ordering the cult members to come out of the buildings.\\If unknown persons dressed in black ninja costumes and combat fatigueswere to attack you, throwing grenades and brandishing firearms, would you notassume that these people are criminals and attempt to defend yourself?  Thetactics employed by the BATF provoked the battle.\\The initial assualt by the BATF was not successful.  Unfortunately, liveswere lost on both sides.  But, had the assault been a success, the liberalmedia would have praised the BATF by showing the footage of BATF agentscarting away a bunch of gun-wielding religious nuts.  Of course, anyviolation of the cult's rights would have been overlooked and the mediawould proclaim America's fortune in having super-cop organizations like theBATF that can systematically ``take out'' terroristic groups such as theBranch Davidians.\\As far as I can see, the BATF and the FBI dropped the ball - just likePhiladelphia did in the 1985 MOVE crisis which left 11 dead, 250 homeless,and a city block razed.It appears that the BATF has adopted the shoot-first tactic of no-knockraids to execute search warrants.  Don't let the BATF convince you thatthe no-knock raid was justified.  No-knock assaults make sense when lookingfor, say, drugs that can easily be hidden or disposed of in a few seconds.The BATF was looking for illegal weapons, not drugs that could be hidden orflushed down the toilet in a matter of a few seconds.  What ever happened to``This is the police!  You are surrounded...''?  {\\it This policy of no-knockraids, by federal and local agencies, should be restricted}.  Further, the useof military firepower against presumed innocent citizens is a very scary idea,and is why the Davidians were justified in using lethal force to ensure thattheir fourth ammendment rights [``the right of the people to be secure intheir persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searchesand seizures''] are not denied.\\\\\\\\noindent Matthew L.

O'KeefeHARD BY THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT, within clear view of the JeffersonMemorial, an easy stroll down the Mall to the majestic Lincoln Memorial,has arisen, on some of the most hallowed territory of the United States ofAmerica, a costly and dangerous mistake.  On ground where no monument yetmarks countless sacrifices and unheralded achievements of Americans of allraces and creeds in the building and defense of this nation, sits today amassive and costly edifice, devoted above all to a contentious and falseversion of the ordeal in Europe during World War II, of non-Americanmembers of a minority, sectarian group.  Now, in the deceptive guise oftolerance, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum begins a propagandacampaign, financed through the unwitting largess of the American taxpayer,in the interests of Israel and its adherents in America.     How did the federal government allow the creation of such amonstrosity?  What is its meaning for American policy and for Americanvalues?  And what must the American people do to regain control of the landtheir servants in Washington handed over to a foreign interest and toestablish an enterprise thereon, whether a museum or otherwise, informed byand conducted according to American principles and interests?[Photograph captioned, "The five-story, $150 million US Holocaust MemorialMuseum in Washington, D.C. was built and is operated by a taxpayer-fundedfederal agency.  In the foreground is the museum's six-sided "Hall ofRemembrance."ORIGINS     In the late 1970s, during the presidency of James Earl "Jimmy" Carter,a propaganda campaign to promote the "Holocaust," the alleged systematicslaughter of some 6 million Jews by the Germans during World War II, wasorganized and carried out from Hollywood and New York. As Benjamin Meed, animportant functionary of the council which controls the Holocaust museum,wrote in 1990:                        Almost a dozen years ago, a new phenomena [sic] developed.  The     Holocaust was introduced into schools, colleges, and universities.     Television broadcast programs on the Holocaust and millions of     Americans watched them.  Soon, Americans took great interest in the     lessons of the Holocaust, its uniqueness and its universal message.(1)     Why the urgency of this campaign? Two factors were paramount:  first,the beginnings, more than three decades after the end of World War II, ofan objective scholarly assessment of the facts of the alleged German policyto exterminate European Jewry.(2)     Second, the need to justify Zionist theory and practice in the face ofunprecedented international resistance to Israeli intransigence (includingthe famous UN General Assembly Resolution which equated Zionism withracism), and to defend Israel's aggressive policy under the leadership ofthe former terrorist, Prime Minister Menachem Begin.(3)THE U.S. HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL COUNCIL     In 1978 President Carter, his administration beleaguered at home andabroad, succumbed to pressure from the new "Holocaust" lobby (and thusAmerica's influential Israel-first minority) by creating, through executiveorder, the President's Commission on the Holocaust.  Two years later, onOctober 7, 1988, Congress passed--unanimously--a law establishing theUnited States Holocaust Memorial Council, charged principally withconstructing and overseeing the operation of "a permanent living memorialto the victims of the holocaust" and with providing "for appropriate waysfor the Nation to commemorate the Days of Remembrance, as an annual,national, civic commemoration of the Holocaust..."(4)     A priceless tract of public land was turned over to the council, and,after years of costly delay (during which the U.S. Holocaust MemorialCouncil's budget swelled from $2.5 million to over $18 million a year), theU.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum has been completed and readied for openingon April 22, 1993.A SECTARIAN, ALIEN AGENDA     The Holocaust Memorial Council, besides soliciting tens of millions ofdollars in tax-deductible donations to finance the Holocaust museum, hasbusied itself with promoting an agenda of unalloyed support for minority,Zionist ends.     The membership of the council, a U.S. federal agency, has beenoverwhelmingly Jewish since its founding in 1980.  The council's twodifferent chairmen--Elie Wiesel and Harvey Meyerhoff--have both beencommitted to the support of the state of Israel, and the chairs of thecouncil's most important committees have been likewise Jewish and Zionist.     The chief fundraiser for the Holocaust museum, Miles Lerman, wasformerly American vice chairman for the State of Israel Bonds Organization,promoting tax-free investment in a country which receives by far thelargest amount of U.S. foreign aid per year.  Working the same wealthyJewish Americans he has long dealt with in his fundraising for Israel,Lerman has helped raise nearly $160 million in tax-deductiblecontributions.  The biggest donors have been rewarded by having variouscomponents of the museum named for them, e.g. the Wexler Learning Center.     Nor is erecting and operating the Holocaust Memorial Museum the onlyfunction with which the Holocaust Memorial Council has been charged.Another of its duties is to commemorate the Days of Remembrance for Victimsof the Holocaust, which Congress has raised to "an annual, national, civiccommemoration of the Holocaust."  Like the Israeli Yom Hashoah (Day of theHolocaust), on which they are based, the Days of Remembrance are datedaccording to the lunar Hebrew calendar, and thus like Passover or Chanukah,fluctuate from year to year. These foreign days of lamentation arecurrently celebrated, under the flag of the republic, to prayers and chantsin Hebrew, in governmental settings from the Capital Rotunda to city halls,across the land.  Need it be stated that no group of American victims ofpersecution, let alone another foreign group, enjoys any such federallymandated and tax-supported day, or days, of recognition?THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM'S ONE-SIDED "HISTORY"     Although the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council during its early yearsmade noises about recognizing the ordeals of non-Jews during World War II,by every indication from advance literature published by the council, theU.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum is relentlessly Judeocentric.  While,according to a preliminary ground plan of the permanent exhibit, here andthere are nods to non-Jewish groups oppressed by the German NationalSocialists (never to groups victimized by Germany's enemies, above all byStalin's USSR), the larger holocaust of World War II, which claimed anestimated 75 to 80 million lives around the world, is ignored in preferenceto the Jewish ordeal. Thus, to cite just one telling example, the museum's"Life before the Holocaust" exhibit refers strictly to *Jewish* life beforethe Holocaust.(5)     Where, in fact, non-Jews figure in the Museum, they figure largely asvillains: the Germans and their allies and collaborators; the WesternAllies, including America, who refused to accept a large immigration beforethe war; the American political and military leaders who refused toauthorize costly bombing raids on the Auschwitz "gas chambers."        RED LIBERATORS?     The museum's message that support for Jews is the sole measure ofdecency during World War II leads to anomalies which, in an American museumraised on ground hallowed to the principles of liberty on which thisrepublic is based, can only be called shocking.  That the victims of WorldWar II atrocities by the Allies--massacres such as the fire-bombing ofTokyo and Dresden, the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Sovietslaughter of their Polish prisoners at Katyn, the mass rapes carried out bythe Red Army at the war's end--receive no mention is deplorable.  But themuseum's treatment of the armed forces which defended Stalin's savageSoviet tyranny is nothing short of grotesque.     In the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, Communists appear only in theguise of "resistance fighters" and "liberators."  For example, thesubmachine gun and false papers of Samuel Weissberg, a Communist Partymember who rose to high rank in a Communist guerrilla group in NorthFrance, are on honored display, no less precious a relic than the standardheaps of shoes and hair, in the museum's permanent exhibit.(6)     Even more unsettling is the honor given to Stalin's notorious RedArmy, which compiled a bloody and shameful record of atrocities acrossEurope during, and after, the war.  As the U.S. Holocaust MemorialCouncil's newsletter fulsomely puts it, "Flags will hang in the museum tohonor the millions of Soviet soldiers who drove Nazi forces westward andwho were the first Allied forces to liberate and publicize the existence ofthe camps."  In the words of Council chairman Harvey Meyerhoff, thesemartial banners of the Red tyranny have a single association: "Much morethan simply wartime memorabilia, these military artifacts are a significantcontribution to memory, one that will remind future generations of thepivotal role Soviet forces played in defeating Nazism..."(7)     What must the millions of Americans originating or descending from theEuropean nations--Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, [former] Yugoslavia--for which the Red "military artifacts" symbolized invasion, tyranny,oppression and persecution of religion think as they see the fierce armiesof *their* persecutors hailed as "liberators"?ISRAEL IN THE MUSEUM     Just as one might guess from the circumstance that the museum'sdirector, Yeshayahu Weinberg, and the head of its "Learning Center,"Yechiam Halevy, were brought in from Israel, the museum's treatment of thestate of Israel is adulatory.  An emotive tribute to the founding of Israelis an integral part of the exhibition.  That the establishment of Israel,and its expansion in subsequent wars, has meant colonial occupation andoppression for millions of the land's native Palestinians, anddispossession and exile for millions more, goes unmentioned--anothergrotesquery in an American museum supposed to instruct in the dangers ofintolerance and disregard of human rights.  As for the momentouscollaboration between Hitler's German state and the Jewish Agency in the1930s, which through the Ha'avara Agreement enabled the transfer of vitalcapital and the influx of tens of thousands of highly skilled Jewishimmigrants to Palestine, that is passed over in utter silence.(8)"HISTORICAL CORRECTNESS"     The Holocaust Museum's skewed history is not simply a matter of one-sidedness and omission.  The museum has further committed itself to a fixedand final interpretation of the surprisingly scanty and sometimes suspectevidence for a German policy of annihilating European Jewry, largely in gaschambers, in numbers approaching 6 million.  This despite a considerablebody of research and scholarship that has arisen over the past two decadesin many lands, and which contests, by academic means, the substance of theHolocaust "extermination thesis."(9)     That the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council is aware of the work of therevisionists is clear: The council's literature is replete, not withsubstantive refutations of revisionist scholarship, but with slander andpolemic.  To cite one characteristic example, the _U.S. Holocaust MemorialMuseum Newsletter_ of May, 1992 featured a front-page attack on Holocaustrevisionism by Professor Deborah Lipstadt of Occidental College in whichthe author decried the revisionists for producing material that lookedscholarly, then lauded the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum as "among themost efficacious ways" of "combating this pernicious trend," *whileneglecting to specify a single error of revisionist scholarship.*(10)     The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council recognizes that there is ahistorical debate on the holocaust, but takes official notice of thedissenting position only to attack it.  That an American institution,supported by the taxes of all Americans, should commit itself to inflexiblehistorical orthodoxy--in the service of a single American minority--is anintolerable imposition on our First Amendment rights, as well as a mockeryof the Western, and American, ideal of objective scholarship.A CENTER FOR EDUCATION?     U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council Chairman Harvey Meyerhoff has stated:"The museum is primarily an educational institution."(11)  From thecouncil's own literature, however, it is clear what Meyerhoff means byeducation.  The "role-playing" for children as well as adults who visit themuseum (visitors are to be issued "identity cards" bearing the name andalleged fate of various Holocaust victims); the high-tech computer andvideo effects and the recordings of speech and music which augment themuseum's tendentiously described artifacts; and the museum's goal, asproclaimed by its Zionist fundraising chairman, Miles Lerman, of ensuringthat "Children in Dubuque, families in Tucson, and schoolteachers inAtlanta will learn the history and the lessons of Auschwitz as thoroughlyas they learn the history of their own communities"--all these show thatthe U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum is a *propaganda* enterprise that seeksto indoctrinate all Americans in a uniquely and partisanly Jewish (andZionist) version of not merely the past, but the present and thefuture.(12)THE AMERICAN RESPONSE     What is the American response to a partisan museum constructed in aplace solemnly consecrated to the heroes and the values of our republic, tobe lavishly operated with taxpayer dollars at a time when, even in ourcountry's capital, thousands sleep homeless in the shadow of our nationalmonuments?  What is the American response to an ambitious propaganda agendathat aims to impose a sectarian "Holocaust remembrance" in schools whereour children cannot pray, in town halls and federal buildings from whichthe religious symbols of the majority are banned in the name of freedom ofworship?     Over two centuries ago, Thomas Jefferson wrote: "To compel a man tofurnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which hedisbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical."(13)     Nearly 150 years ago, Abraham Lincoln said: "I insist that if there is*anything* which it is the duty of the *whole people* to never entrust toany hands but their own, that thing is the preservation and perpetuity oftheir own liberties and institutions."(14)     The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, and the council which runs it, asagencies of the government in which the American people is sovereign, mustbe removed from the special interest that now controls it.     The scope and purpose of the Museum must be expanded, from its presentone-sided emphasis on foreign Jewish sufferings, real and imagined, inEurope during the 1930s and 1940s to a compassionate yet realistic concernfor *all* victims, but above all for *American* victims, of historicinjustice.     The Museum must be made a place where Americans of every heritage, andscholars of every viewpoint, may gather, educate, and be educated, withoutaccusation and in the absence of propaganda.  Until it is, the men andwomen who founded and built and suffered and fought and died for America,of every race, nationality and creed, will rest uneasy.NOTES     1. _The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Newsletter_(Washington, D.C.), August, 1990, "Survivors Play Major Role inEstablishing the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum," p.1.

So they haveto go to a proper legislative body to get such a law enacted.

Libertarians and anarchists are not alone in being uncomfortablewith the use of state sponsored coercion.  The notion that coercion canbe virtually eliminated in a society (or more properly that once it iseliminated on the part of the state it is no longer worth serious consideration) is a view that is peculiar to libertarians and anarchists.  For example, does "non-initiated force" (coercion) include tax collection?Does it include the minimal level of regulation of commerce envisionedby Adam Smith?  Since coercion can be exercised by actors other than thestate, how is the state to deal with it?  Exclusively through after thefact arbitration/legal compulsion?  >>The means to reaching such a restricted government is another topic>which I'll address briefly.

I'd venture to point out, however, that if libertarians couldn't convince at least 85% of a group of "seminar participants" to "embrace" their philosophy, their propaganda skills need to be honed.  Frankly, however, it is no great trick to create a government for a society in which (almost) everyone is assumed to agree about what is a propergovernment policy.  Once that is assumed, all sorts of annoying formalitiescan be dispensed with, elections, police, etc.  And as Mr. Marx said,the state will just wither away.  On the way there, however, would you like to explain how eliminating virtually all policies that restrain private coercion in the current society will help us to live happier lives? Or is it likesocialism; just some short-term pain that we'll have to bear until everyone has had the benefit of "re-education" through regular "seminar" training?jsh>>Roger Collins--Steve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM   "One thing about data, it sure does cut|  UUCP:    ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh the bulls**t." - R.

THOSE INTREPID ISRAELI SOLDIERS    Israeli soldiers have sexually taunted Arab women in the occupied Gaza Strip  during the three-week-long closure that has sealed Palestinians off from the  Jewish state, Palestinian sources said on Sunday.  The incidents occurred in the town of Khan Younis and involved soldiers of the Golani Brigade who have been at the centre of house-to-house raids for Palestinian activists during the closure, which was imposed on the strip and occupied West Bank.  Five days ago girls at the Al-Khansaa secondary said a group of naked soldiers taunted them, yelling: ``Come and kiss me.'' When the girls fled,  the soldiers threw empty bottles at them.      On Saturday, a group of soldiers opened their shirts and pulled down their pants when they saw girls from Al-Khansaa walking home from school. Parents  are considering keeping their daughters home from the all-girls school.      The same day, soldiers harassed two passing schoolgirls after a youth escaped from them at a boys' secondary school. Deputy Principal Srur  Abu-Jamea said they shouted abusive language at the girls, backed them  against a wall, and put their arms around them.  When teacher Hamdan Abu-Hajras intervened the soldiers kicked him and beat him with the butts of their rifles.  On Tuesday, troops stopped a car driven by Abdel Azzim Qdieh, a practising Moslem, and demanded he kiss his female passenger. Qdieh refused, the  soldiers hit him and the 18-year-old passenger kissed him to stop the  beating.  On Friday, soldiers entered the home of Zamno Abu-Ealyan, 60, blindfolded him and his wife, put a music tape on a recorder and demanded they dance. As the elderly couple danced, the soldiers slipped away. The coupled continued dancing until their grandson came in and asked what was happening.      The army said it was checking the reports.                 ....................        ISRAELI TROOPS BAR CHRISTIANS FROM JERUSALEM  Israeli troops prevented Christian Arabs from entering Jerusalem on Thursday  to celebrate the traditional mass of the Last Supper.      Two Arab priests from the Greek Orthodox church led some 30 worshippers in prayer at a checkpoint separating the occupied West Bank from Jerusalem after soldiers told them only people with army-issued permits could enter.      ``Right now, our brothers are celebrating mass in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and we were hoping to be able to join them in prayer,'' said Father George Makhlouf of the Ramallah Parish.      Israel sealed off the occupied lands two weeks ago after a spate of Palestinian attacks against Jews. The closure cut off Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza Strip from Jerusalem, their economic, spiritual and cultural centre.     Father Nicola Akel said Christians did not want to suffer the humiliation of requesting permits to reach holy sites.      Makhlouf said the closure was discriminatory, allowing Jews free movement to take part in recent Passover celebrations while restricting Christian celebrations.      ``Yesterday, we saw the Jews celebrate Passover without any interruption. But we cannot reach our holiest sites,'' he said.      An Israeli officer interrupted Makhlouf's speech, demanding to see his identity card before ordering the crowd to leave.                    ...................

The focus of their intent ishis sexual orientation, and so the law applies to them as well. Thenational government retains the right to make any laws necessary tosufficiently deter and punish any crime against someone's civil rightsuntil that behavior becomes so well punished that nobody even tries it!The fact is, that at last count, gays were not beating straights for theirsexual orientation. Thus, the law is getting applied only to the straightswho indulge themselves. The federal government or judiciary has the rightto enforce the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under law evenif it takes 1000 possible charges against people who would violate them.

At   least one history I have read formed the opinion that they left for the   US not to practice religious freedom but to practice religious intolerance.Sigh, see what our school systems are producing?  Total confusion!The original English settlers were, probably, the most intolerant lotof people to ever assemble.  However, the Founding Fathers(Washington, Jefferson, Madison, etc.), practically made it theirlife's work to ensure that religious intolerance would not destroytheir great experiment... a democratic republic.I strongly suggest that those interested get some of Jefferson's andMadison's writings. Particularly good is Madison's "(something)andRemonstrance", [yea, I'm litterate and have functioning memory cells:-( ].  IMHO, Jefferson and Madison were the two greatest American'swho ever lived. Although both were products of their time (Jeffersonwas a slave owner), they were able to see more clearly than theircontemporaries, and for that matter, more clearly than most modernpoliticians. Their prose is the epitome of eloquence. I don't knowabout y'all, but reading the Declaration of Independence give memental goosebumps. (For those who have never read it, I am appending acopy of it.)--In CONGRESS, July 4, 1776The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America,When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for onepeople to dissolve the political bands which have connected them withanother, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate andequal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitlethem, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that theyshould declare the causes which impel them to the separation.We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are createdequal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienableRights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit ofHappiness.  That to secure these rights, Governments are institutedamong Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of thegoverned.  That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive ofthese ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it,and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on suchprinciples and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shallseem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.  Prudence,indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not bechanged for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experiencehath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils aresufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to whichthey are accustomed.  But when a long train of abuses and usurpations,pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce themunder absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, tothrow off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their futuresecurity.Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such isnow the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systemsof Government.  The history of the present King of Great Britain is ahistory of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in directobject the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.  Toprove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessaryfor the public good.He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressingimportance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent shouldbe obtained, and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attendto them.He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of largedistricts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right ofRepresentation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them andformidable to tyrants only.He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their publicRecords, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance withhis measures.He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing withmanly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to causeothers to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable ofAnnihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise;the State remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers ofinvasion from without, and convulsions within.He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for thatpurpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners;refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, andraising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing hisAssent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure oftheir offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms ofOfficers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies, without theconsent of our legislatures.He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior tothe Civil power.He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign toour constitution and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent totheir Acts of pretended Legislation:For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:For protecting them by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders    which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:For depriving us in many cases of the benefits of Trial by Jury:For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring    Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and    enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example    and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into    these Colonies:For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and    altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested    with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.He has abdicated Government here by declaring us out of his Protectionand waging War against us.He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, anddestroyed the lives of our people.He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries tocomplete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begunwith circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in themost barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilizednation.He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seasto bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners oftheir friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavouredto bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless IndianSavages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destructionof all ages, sexes and conditions.In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress inthe most humble terms.  Our repeated Petitions have been answered onlyby repeated injury.  A Prince, whose character is thus marked by everyact which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a freepeople.Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren.We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature    to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and    settlement here.We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity,    and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow    these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections    and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice     and of consanguinity.We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our    Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies     in War, in Peace Friends.We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, inGeneral Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of theworld for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by theauthority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish anddeclare.  That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to beFree and Independent States; that they are Absolved from allAllegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connectionbetween them and the State of Great Britain is and ought to be totallydissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have fullPower to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establishCommerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent Statesmay of right do.  And for the support of this Declaration, with a firmreliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge toeach other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.New Hampshire: Josiah Bartlett, William Whipple, Matthew ThorntonMassachusetts: John Hancock, Samual Adams, John Adams, Robert Treat Paine,    Elbridge GerryRhode Island: Stephen Hopkins, William ElleryConnecticut: Roger Sherman, Samuel Huntington, William Williams, Oliver WolcottNew York: William Floyd, Philip Livingston, Francis Lewis, Lewis MorrisNew Jersey: Richard Stockton, John Witherspoon, Francis Hopkinson, John Hart,    Abraham ClarkPennsylvania: Robert Morris, Benjamin Rush, Benjamin Franklin, John Morton,    George Clymer, James Smith, George Taylor, James Wilson, George RossDelaware: Caesar Rodney, George Read, Thomas McKeanMaryland: Samuel Chase, William Paca, Thomas Stone,    Charles Carroll of CarrolltonVirginia: George Wythe, Richard Henry Lee, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Harrison,Thomas Nelson, Jr., Francis Lightfoot Lee, Carter BraxtonNorth Carolina: William Hooper, Joseph Hewes, John PennSouth Carolina: Edward Rutledge, Thomas Heyward, Jr., Thomas Lynch, Jr.,    Arthur MiddletonGeorgia: Button Gwinnett, Lyman Hall, George Walton--Gerry Roston (gerry@cmu.edu)    | I cannot conceive of a God who rewards andField Robotics Center,          | punishes his creatures, or has a will ofCarnegie Mellon University      | the type of which we are conscious inPittsburgh, PA, 15213           | ourselves.

And remember that the actual health care is deliveredby private entities who collect from the public insurance voluntarily.Again, they can't force a private entity to spring to life to pay them.Plus, there is the matter of culture and values ...

The competition is fake if it exists at all, because they'reall interlinked.  Look in Der Spiegel or Stern (my girlfriend is inour German department  and her uncle is a private practicioner inSaarbrucken) ... no ads for health insurance.  While Canada organizesby province, Germany organizes the paperwork around big corporationsand regional offices.   But remember that we have provinces that havethe same population as some major German corporations.  Germans havepublic health insurance, just that it is brokered by smaller entities(actually, brokerage of basic by private firms who'll sell extrainsurance to fill out their policies, sort of a voucher system,was one of the first ideas floated in Canada, too).Remember, the Germans don't have HMO's ... a telling sign, 'cosRochester does and they're also a company town.>But there was a Washington Post article recently about that that said>Canadian doctors often use myelograms instead of MRIs, which require>spinal injections and can cause seizures and headaches.

If much or some of it were true, you'd have to takeus for idiots for tolerating it.  And given that our insurance wasinstalled during a period when there were only Liberal and Torygovernments federally and provincially, and the socialists are stillchafing, they would've pressed for real socialized medicine to fixthings ... think about it.

Ignore the solid, inescapable fact that we've existed as long as humans have.  Fear us.  Go ahead.  Laugh at us if it makes you feel better.  We both know you're just whistling in the dark.

You're not part of the norm.  You're part of a minority--YES, a minority!--with supreme, o'erweening arrogance.  Your hubris will topple, because it always has, because those with intelligence know it to be a clown's costume.Wow, that was pretentious!  I sometimes wonder why I waste my talents on zeroes like you.

It's all to clear these days, from thecomments of the "president" and the rationalizations of his supportersin these groups, that in a liberal Democratic vision of America onlya certain select few people can expect to have civil rights enforced, and this administration intends to enforce laws, apply the Constitutionand obey the laws only when it suits them to do so.

Carmel "camp" on Monday.Neither is Atty. General Reno.  The issuance of tear gas might have not beenthe best idea to achieve the extrication of the Branch Davidians, butprevious attempts through negotiation had fallen through and the FBI had said that this was to end asap.One person and one person ONLY is to blame for this. Vernon Howell aka David Koresh. It was he who issued the order to start shooting at the BATF agents when they went to serve the arrest warrant on Feb 28. It was the Davidians who KILLED four law enforcement agents, and injured several others. It was Koresh who refused to peacefully walk out of the compound and fight out the legalities in a court of law, with a jury of 11 citizens. (note: I can't saya jury of his peers, as his writings indicate that he thought that he was Jesus. It would be pretty difficult to find that many self-appointed prophets in the North Texas area.)As for who started the fires in the building, there have been numerous localnews reports with interviews with some of the rescued people stating in facttheir own people were starting the fires.  Once again, it wasn't Reno, or Clinton who lit the matches in this. It was Vernon Howell. The only people in the building I feel sorry for are the children who perished in the blaze,as they had no choice in the matter. The rest of them had every chance.So Steven, please scrape up your pennies and nickels and go buy yourself aclue.Tom-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Tom Hyatt                                  I'm a diehard Saints fan, so i've    thyat@sdf.lonestar.org                     suffered quite enough, thank you!

Maybe it was thegovernment; maybe it was Koresh.  I wouldn't immediately rule out thegovernment just because the FBI said that a couple of cult memberstorched Koresh's wood-frame house.  I think that the credibility of theFBI and the cigarette cops is questionable at best; at worst they arebald-faced liers.  I read in a newspaper today that one of the BDs thatsurvived the fire said that one of the tanks that crashed through theirwood-frame house knocked over a lantern which later on caused thecompound to errupt in flames.  Also, I have heard that one of the cultmembers who earlier said that he and another individual started the fireis no longer claiming that he did it.  Moreover, he and possibly theother person may not have even really said that they did it in thefirst place---we only have the FBI's WORD ON THIS.  I'll believe it whenI hear from a cult member's own mouth and not before then.The FBI claims that they saw two cult members starting the fire.  Theyclaimed that the two were clad in black clothing and were wearing gasmasks.  Hmmm...  Sounds like they might have been describing an ATFagent to me.  Weren't the cigarette cops wearing black?  Note:  thisis just speculation on my part.  Still, it is something to think about.Here's something else to ponder upon:  the two agents that were plantedin the compound might have done something to start that fire.  I don'tknow if they did it deliberately or not---if they did at all---but Iwould like to see statements from these two agents on the events thattranspired during that day.  I think that they would be ratherenlightening don't you think?  They were inside the compound so theyought to have a real good idea of what went on in there.  Of course ifthey did help burn down the house then I doubt that they would bevery forthcoming with any information.The FBI also mentioned that fire errupted in multiple locations in thecompound.  They *may* have said this so that people might be morelikely to be convinced that the BDs started the fire.  However,consider that if the FBI did light-up that house would they admit toit?  I think not.  Imagine the public outrage that would ensue ifpeople discovered that the FBI killed 86 people.  Obviously, the FBIwould do its best to suppress the truth and make people think the BDsstarted the fire.  Fire can spread in unusual ways in a wood house---fires burning in more than one location in a house isn't inconsistentwith a house fire.  The tear gas cannisters---which do produce heatdespite what you may have been told by the media---may have contributedto starting the blaze.  Also, it was very windy on the day of thefire.  Flames and burning debri might have floated over to parts ofthe house that weren't already on fire.  Like I said the verdict isn'tin yet.

There is norational reason to give an "abortionist" a "value" 10 million times thatof a fetus.  (Why not 10 billion, for instance...oh, but then you wouldloose on the deal.)Instead we should look at what is *really* involved in each abortion.There is the loss of a human life, a life that would otherwise haveeventually become a member of society.  That is certainly a non-zerovalue.  There is the physical and emotional suffering of a woman whofinds herself with an unwanted pregnancy, and the greater sufferingcaused by the refusal of society to allow her to deal with it.  Thatwoman is *already* a member of society.I argue that the cost of suffering of a *real* member of society isfar greater than the loss of a *potential* future member of society.Now, as for your "deal".  Suppose you "pay" the value of all the sufferingof every woman who *was* denied an abortion, or *would have been* deniedan abortion, under your desired position.  And "we" will "pay" the valueof all the potential future members of society that never became a part ofit (or *would* not have been a part of it, under *our* desired position).Think about it.Of course, I expect you will object to my argument that suffering ofon-going life is worse than loss of just-starting life.  If so, pleaseput forth some rational argument for how the life of a (currently)non-sentient creature is somehow worth the suffering of a sentient being.(I figure if I ask enough places, and such an arguement exists, I shouldeventually see it.)-Rob

Janus, Ph.D.and Cynthia L. Janus, M.D., John Wiley & Sons (pub), 1992) has thefollowing:Table 3.14Have you ever had a homosexual experience?          Men.

This number is consistent with Kinsey, Pomery,Gebard (1953), Bell & Weinberg (1967, 1974), and Rice (1987) in thefinding that 9% of the male population is actively homosexual, withan further breakdown (Bell & Wienberg, 1978) of 4% exclusively so and5% self-identifying themselves as "bisexuals."   (pp 69, 70)   As for debunking Kinsey, the following article is an importantlesson for everyone to read:Was Kinsey a Fake and a Pervert?by Philip Nobile     Far out on the grassy knoll of sexology, there is a cult ofprochastity researchers who claim that the late Alfred Kinsey was asecret sex criminal, a Hoosier Dr. Mengele, who bent his numberstoward the bisexual and the bizarre in a grand conspiracy to queer thenation and usher in an era of free sex with kids.       But what really riles these critics is Kinsey's towerin~ culturalinfluence.  His bestselling surveys-- Sexual Behavior in the Human Male(1948) and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953)-- tore thesheets off the country's erogenous zones and undermined midcenturymorals.  His charts and graphs, based on detailed histories of 12,000men and women, demonstrated that practices generally considered rareand/or 'abnormal'-- masturbation, extramarital relations,homosexuality, and even barnyard bestiality, were as American asstrawberry shortcake.       Yet for a hard core of these heterosexual supremacists, aided andabetted by Pat Buchanan and the religious right, the zoology professorfrom Indiana University remains the evil genius behind the sexrevolution and a target for character assassination.       Judith Reisman, the prosecution's expert witness at theMapplethorpe trial in Cincinnati, is the leader of the anti- Kinseyrevisionists as well as his Inspector Javert.  In 1983, during a radiointerview with Pat Buchanan in Washington, Reisman accused Kinsey ofhaving been inolved in "the vicious genital torture of hundreds ofchildren."  She speculated that he kidnapped and drugged ghetto boys inorder to carry out clandestine orgasm tests.       Now, seven years later, Reisman has revived her charges in adifferent book, titled Kinsey, Sex and Fraud, just released by thesmall and religiously oriented Huntington House in Lafayette,Louisiana.  Her coauthor is Ed Eichel, a Manhattan psychotherapist whohas invented a new style of intromission ("the coital alignmenttechnique") that supposedly triggers simultaneous orgasm withconsiderable regularity and thereby increases compatibilty between thesexes.  In the book Eichel contends that "Kinsey deliberately cookedthe gay stats because, being an oddball himself, he wanted to advancethe 'denormalization' of heterosexuality."       If the authors are right, then the world- famous Kinsey Reportsare, as the introduction boldly asserts, "the most egregious exampleof scientific deception in this century."  And if they are wrong,Kinsey, Sex and Fraud is a shameful smear.     Despite the less- than- stellar credentials of Kinsey'sdetractors, legends are not what they used to be.  Martin Luther Kingmay have committed plagiarism.  Bruno Bettelheim slapped young mentalpatients around.  Father Bruce Ritter, the founder of Covenant House,preyed on runaway boys.  Closer to Kinsey, Masters and Johnson havebeen disgraced for faking it in one way or another.       So it should not surprise anybody that Kinsey, who filmed strangepeople having sex in his attic, may have had skeletons in the closet.The problem is that Reisman does not seem to have the intellectualprowess to pull off the job.       As a thinker, the woman is no Madame Curie.  The 55-year-oldformer songwriter for Captain Kangaroo has little professionalstanding, no current university position, and no peer-reviewpublications, though her creative 1983 resume was padded with phantomaccomplishments.  For instance, it listed a book as her own-- Take Backthe Night: Women on Pornography-- that was actually written and editedby others.  Then there is her Ph.D. in Speech Communication fromCleveland's Case Western Reserve University.  Although Reisman has nobachelor's degree, Case granted her a master's in 1976 and a doctoratein 1979.  Her dissertation was on the commentaries of a localoctagenarian TV commentator.  But on the resume, Reisman gave thispiece of scholarship a fancy Hautes Etudes moniker-- to wit: "TheApplication of Aristotelian and Systems Analytic Theory to Mass MediaEffects."     When Reisman burst into prominence on Buchanan's program, it waslove at first sight for Al Regnery, the outwardly anti- porn head of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in Ed Meese'sJustice Department.  Regnery was a young law-and-order conservative andamateur social philosopher who wanted to help change the sexualclimate of the United States.       After Reisman's sensational radio session, the sexual equivalentof Joe McCarthy's Wheeling speech, Regnery summoned her to meetings to discuss mutual interests.  First he tried to shovelher $800,000 for a quasi-Frankenstein study that was going to measurethe brain chemicals of men and boys who looked at arousingphotographs.  Guffaws on Capitol Hill killed the original proposal, but$734,000 in govemment money went to Reisman anyway for plan B- a probeof child images in the cartoons Playboy, Penthouse, and Hustler.  (Incredibly, this grant surpassed the entire budget of theattorney general's pornography commission.)      When the overpriced and oversold project was completed in 1986,it was immediately shelved by an embarrassed Justice Department.  Thatspring, Regnery resigned from his post only days before the NewRepublic carried this admission that he had kept porno magazinesaround the house.       Notwithstanding the six-figure humiliation, Reisman went on toscratch out a niche on the ioony right.  As the darling of the sexcranks, she deplores subversive phenomena like shaved genitalia inmen's magazines and blames AIDS on gays.  Kinsey, Sex and Fraud isReisman's latest grasp for respectability.  Pat Buchanan, of course, isputting his Krugerrands on Reisman's ultimate vindication.  "This bookis social dynamite," he says in a blurb an the front cover.  Heespecially liked the antigay parts.  Smacking his lips in hissyndicated column, he declared, "It may just blow the sewer cap offKinsey's monumental reputation, reestablish homosexuality as a 1-in-50aberration, expose the Gay Rights movement as a paper tiger, and evenput at risk the enormous sex industry built upon Dr. Kinsey's'research.'"     The blockbuster charge at the heart of the cluttered andrepetilive j'Accuse is that Kinsey was a sex-mad pedophile whomolested little boys in Nazi-type experiments and recorded theirorgasms in his male volume/ A similar charge was first recited at theFifth World Conference on Sexology in Jerusalem in 1981 to no effectbefore being recycled by Reisman for Buchanan in Washington in 1983.     Here is how Reisman and Eichel repackaged the Mengele business inKinsey, Sex and Fraud:     Mengele-like 'scientific' experiments on infants and childrenwere the basis for Kinsey's conclusions...  on childhood sexuality.     Somewhere and sometime in the course of the project, Kinseyappears to have directed experimental sex research on several hundredchildren aged from two months to almost 15 years.     This, of course, would implicate Kinsey and his team inpromoting, and perhaps participating in, the criminal activity.     In the opinion of this book's authors, that is exactly how partof Kinsey's child sexuality research took place.     Donning his psychohistorian's cap and citing an FBI manual onchild molesters as a guide, Eichel casually diagnoses Kinsey as ahomosexual pedophile with the perfect motive for doing exactly asReisman said:       [Kinsey] placed himself in professional and nonprofessionalpositions where he had access to young boys, such as Y.M.C.A.  campcounselor, boys' club leader, and Boy Scout leader-- activities hekept up 'during his college and graduate yeaers, and even after hismarriage."      As crude as his analysis seems, Eichel was more than happy toelaborate even further in a recent phone interview.  "If you've everbeen around boy- lovers, pedophiles, they are absolutely compulsive,"he averred.  "Everything in his life is directed at getting children.  Ididn't mention this in our book but the caption under Kinsey's highschool picture was a quote from Hamlet: 'Man delights me not, no,[sic] nor woman neither.' What do you think they were picking up on?"      Before weighing what Reisman and Eichel pass off as proof ofKinsey's sex crimes, something must be said about Kinsey's scientificmodus operandi.  He was a fiendish collector.  As a young zoologist witha D.Sc.  from Harvard, he collected 4 million gall wasps and 1.5million related insects.  When he switched to sex exploration afteragreeing to teach a marriage Course at Indiana University in 1938, hewas no less curious or acquisitive.  Nothing that mammals did in therealm of reproduction was foreign to him.  He compiled masses of eroticmaterials including toilet wall inscriptions from male and femalejohns that highlighted differences in sexual psychology and flms ofmating in 14 species of animals that showed an amazing similarity inoral eroticism.       Naturally, the sexual response of children, the genesis of eros,fascinated him.  It was impossible to understand the sexual behaviorsof adults without examining their origins.  And so with the fervor ofhis bughunting days, Kinsey collected information about kids, thougheven his worst enemies-- until Reisman and Eichel-- refrained fromlinking him personally to his data on preadolescent sex.       Kinsey said plainly in the male volume that he got information onthe sex life of young boys from people who had sex with them: "Some ofthese adults are technically trained persons who have kept diaries orother records which have been put at our disposal."  Although hegathered much boyhood data from the memories of his subjects and theobservations of parents and nursery school teachers, he treated thedocumentary materia! of the pedophiles as pure gold.  There was nothinglike it in the literature.       Kinsey's main source, a 63-year-old govemment worker, was alsothe most unforgettable character he had ever met.  This man, whosehistory took 17 hours to log, had sex with over 600 boys and 200 girlsas well as 17 of 33 family members including his father andgrandmother.  A sexual hobbyist and passionate record-keeper, he gaveKinsey detailed accounts of orgasms that he observed in preadolescentboys.  Relying on the man's meticulous research, which involvedfollowing some boys for as long as 16 years, Kinsey was able toidentify for the first time six distinct types of male orgasm-- someof which involved violent contortions at the peak of release-- as wellas the speed and the capacity of climax.       What Freud had only imagined about childhood sexuality, Kinseyhad reported as fact.  Children were indeed erotic beings from thecradle.  "These data on the sexual activities of younger male providean important substantiation of the Freudian view of sexuality as acomponent that is present in the human animal from earliest infancy,"he concluded without raising eyebrows in 1948.       Then along came Judith Reisman.  Ignorng the legitimacy ofKinsey's inquiry, she beheld the ghost of Mengele in Bloomington.  Shewas appalled by the thought of infant ecstasy and read torture in theportrayals of prepubertal orgasm rendered by the government worker.And she dared to say that Kinsey was a sex criminal.       Well, was he or wasn't he? Let's go to the text.  There is noevidence in Kinsey, Sex and Fraud-- no witnesses, no paper, noteven atrace of hearsay-- that implicates Kinsey in either planning orpartaking in child sex experiments.  After 12 years on the trail,Reisman has uncovered just two sources to back up her original charge-- amazingly enough, Kinsey himself and Wardell Pomeroy, Kinsey'scoauthor on both reports, to whom Reisman has never spoken.  It turnsout that her whole case rests on a few passages in the male volumeiand in Pomeroy's 1972 biography titled Dr. Kinsey and the Institutefor Sex Research.     After frisking every "the" and "and" in both books, Reisman cameup with what she believes are "smoking" sentences.  To establishKinsey's alleged role in the planning, she says that "there is a hint"in the fifth chapter of the male volume that Kinsey "directed" theorgasm studies on kids.  She cites his tell-tale quote from a critic ofarmchair psychoanalysis demanding that "writers...test theirtheories...by empirical study and statistical procedures."  Then shecombines this quote with Kinsey's statement that some of theobservations of his pedophile sources "were continued over periods ofmonths or years until the individuals were old enough to make itcertain that true orgasm was involved."       Putting two and two together-- Kinsey's empiricism and lengthyexperimentation-- she arrives at her hint.  But realizing this dogwould not hunt, she devoted but a single paragraph to Kinsey'ssupposed planning before shifting to the issue of his personalinvolvement.  As for the alleged participation, after poring overPomeroy's biography, Reisman found several hidden clues suggestingKinsey's likely hands-on approach to kiddie sex.  Here the chain ofreasoning is more complex.  She points out that Kinsey was interestedin clitoral measurements, collecting sperm and filming sex in hisattic.  Since Kinsey did indeed mislead Indiana University about thepurpose of his cinematography-- he said that he was filming "animalsex"-- Reisman asserts that a "similar misrepresentation may yet applyto Kinsey's child sex experiments."  Catch the "may"!     Reisman was also struck by Kinsey's doubting Thomas attitudetoward the never before recorded climax of female rabbits: "Kinsey,according to Pomeroy, was the type of person who needed to see thingsfor himself.  Pomeroy gave the example of orgasm in the female rabbit.Because he had not personally witnessed this event, Kinsey haddifficulty in accepting its reality, even on the strength of testimonyfrom a distinguished scientist.  How then did Kinsey testify to theactuality of orgasm in a 5-month-old infant from the mere 'history' ofa sex offender?" (But, of course, he did not: he depended on theirrecords.)      From this fantastic alchemy of conjecture mixed with clitorides,sperm, attic cumshots, and climax-in-cottontail has Reisman defamedthe legendary Kinsey.     Paul Gebhard succeeded Kinsey as the director of the KinseyInstitute and now lives in retirement outside Bloomington.  Reached bytelephone, Gebhard defended the pedophile connection and deniedReisman's nasty imputations.  "I don't understand the resistance ofpeople like Reisman to studying the sexuality of children," Gebhardsaid more in exasperation than anger.  "That is where sex begins.  Wewere happy to take data wherever we found it.  Even though pedophilescommit criminal acts, they are usually not violent folks.  Theywouldn't be very successful if they were.  One of our best sources wasa headmaster of a boys' school who maintained a kind of alumni cluband sometimes went to the weddings of his former students.  As fordirecting experiments, that's absurd.  We never told any of oursubjects what to do.  lt was against our principles.  Almost all of thepedophile material was retrospective anyway.  Nor did we ever conductsex experiments with children ourselves.  That would have been highlyinappropriate."       I asked Gebhard if Kinsey had ever seen a child in a sexualsituation.  "I think a mother once brought in a little girl who humpedher teddy bear and Kinsey watched it."       As for Kinsey's sex life, it is still shrouded inconfidentiality.  He was married to the same woman for 35 years andfathered four children.  Apparently, there are no huge sexualrevelations, although rumors of homosexuality have persisted withoutconfirmation through the years.  Gebhard took his boss's history backin the '40s, but he refuses to discuss what he knows.  "We neverdivulge anything about anybody's history, whether dead or alive," hesays.       Reisman said no to an interview for this article on the groundsthat I had once worked for Penthouse-- not to mention the fact that wehave been debating each other in various forums for the past fiveyears.  In keeping with our contentious history, she took a swipe at mein her book for continuing "the Kinsey practice of euphemizingincest."  My offense was using the biblical variant "lying with a nearrelative" in a 1977 article on the subject of incest.  As a synonym forintercourse, "lying with" appears eight times in Genesis.       Ed Eichel is a different story.  Though seemingly obsessed byKinsey like his coauthor, he was friendly in long conversations.  Hetold me that he began to smell a big baised agenda in sexology when hewas a student in New York University's Human Sexuality program in theearly '80s.  "It was literally a gay studies program for heterosexuals,"he says.     Around 1985, Eichel came upon Reisman's critique of Kinsey andthe conspiracy theory started to sink in: the sex establishment wasruled by a Kinseyan bisexual bund advocating the overthrow of theheterosexual norm.  No wonder he was having such a rough time promotingthe joy of simultaneous orgasm-- anything that enhanced sexualcompatibility between men and women inevitably raised objections.     Eventually, Eichel exchanged philosophical fluids with Reisman,and from this union Kinsey, Sex and Fraud was born.  Eichel's maincontribution to the book is discovery and analysis of a Kinseyconspiracy that supposedly seeks "the establishment of bisexuality asthe balanced sexual orientation for normal, uninhibited people" which,by destroying the traditional family structure and normal sexualbehavior, "would open the way for the second and more difficult step--the ultimate goal of cross-generational sex (sex with children)."       When I pressed him for specific references to back up hisoutrageous contentions, he said weakly, "You don't think Kinsey isgoing to come right out and say that everybody is basically bisexualand should have sex with kids, but this is implicit in the Kinseyreports."       Meanwhile, Eichel is demanding a congressional investigation ofKinsey and his data.  Perfect.  That's just what the country needs-- aHouse Un-American Sexual Activities Committee, looking under beds andasking people if they are now or have everbeen a reader, a sympathizeror-- God forbid-- a subject of Dr. Alfred Kinsey.

EDT               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I guess I'm just prepared to take questions today.          Q  George, Bob Dole says that the Clinton administration's policy on Bosnia is a failure and that he wants the United States to take the lead in lifting the arms embargo so that the Bosnian Muslims can defend themselves.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, President Clinton has said that that suggestion is under active consideration.  Obviously, this is a tragic situation in Bosnia.  And if the Bosnian Serbs don't come to the negotiating table in a constructive way, we'll look seriously at pressing for lifting the arms embargo.  In the meantime, we're going to continue to press for a tough sanctions resolution in the U.N.  We're going to continue to work on the Serbs to come to the negotiating table.  But the prospect of an arms embargo is something the President certainly will consider if the Serbs don't come to the table.          Q  How much longer are you going to give them to come to the table, George?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on that right now.          Q  It's been a long time.          Q  On February 19th, the President mentioned the value added tax in Ohio.  And when he was asked about it later by reporters, he said -- quote -- "That is a radical change in the tax system of the United States.  It's something I think we may have to look at in the years ahead."  Questioned again about it later he says, "It is not something that is now under consideration.  If we start considering it, I'll tell you."  It wasn't a trial balloon or anything, he said.  I was just discussing the tax response to a question.  Donna Shalala, quoted in USA Today this morning -- quote -- "Certainly we're looking at a VAT."  What's gone on?          Q  The same with Alice Rivlin this morning.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The health care task force is reviewing a number of options.  They haven't made any decisions yet.  And as I have said from this podium time and time again, we're not going to comment on decisions that haven't been made.          Q  But you have also said from this podium time and time again --          Q  Wait a minute.  Whoa, Nelly.  Whoa.            Q     that that was not under consideration.          Q  Yes.  Clinton says, "It is not something that is now under consideration."  Is that no longer true?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe the working group, as Ms. Shalala says, has looked at this prospect, but no decisions have been made of any kind.          Q  Well, I know.  But he said he'd tell us about it if it was ever under consideration.  I take it that now he is and he didn't tell us about it or --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Did he say if it was under consideration or if it was something to be proposed?          Q  "If we start considering I'll tell you."          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If it's something to be proposed?          Q  "If we start considering it, I'll tell you."  That's a direct quote.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The task force has looked at a number of different options.  They have not made any decisions yet.  The President has not made any decisions yet.  This is -- one of the proposals under consideration by the task force was to go out and cast as wide a net as possible for different ideas on how to reform the health care system.  They have cast a very wide net.  They have looked at hundreds of different proposals -- probably thousands of different proposals.  But the President has not made any decisions.          Q  Well, is the President aware of their consideration of this option?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he's been briefed on any preliminary conclusions or anything like that from the task force on this specific proposal of any kind.  I don't know that that's gotten to his level.  He started yesterday to go through with the task force a very wide range of decisions and I don't believe that that's been presented to him, no.          Q  Well, he's not relying on the USA Today to tell him what his task force is considering in the way of taxes.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he's going through it in a very deliberate fashion.  There are a number of decisions that have to be made.  I don't know that this proposal has reached that decision-making point.          Q  If this is still under consideration, that's a change, at least from what we've been told by Dee Dee, I think about three weeks ago or so.  She said, that is not an option, talking about the -- had a big argument with somebody over this, so I remember it specifically -- and said it not once, but twice.  Is that not the case?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if this has been presented to the President as something that is being looked at at some level in the task force.          Q  It was ruled it out, though.  I mean, unlike other options that you've kept in the mix, this one specifically was ruled out.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, this is something that is being looked at, but no decision has been made of any kind.  I mean, it doesn't -- it's not necessarily material until you get to the decision-making phase.  The working groups are looking at hundreds of different options.          Q  If it was ruled out before and it's not ruled out now, then something has changed, George.  Yes, no?          Q  When a guy says in February --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the working groups are looking at the widest possible range of options.          Q  So something's changed.  They weren't looking at it before; they're looking at it now.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know if the working groups have gotten to that point yet.  They are casting a very wide net.          Q  How was it possible that you and Dee Dee were able to sell -- definitively rule it out as an option previously and now are saying that, in fact, it is being considered?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, the working groups are looking at a wide range of options.  They have not --          Q  Do you deny that you and Dee Dee ruled it -- flatly ruled it out on several occasions in the past month?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't deny that -- I mean, those are the President's words.  Those are very clear.          Q  Subsequent to the President's words, do you deny that within the last month you and Dee Dee have both publicly ruled it out?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about the timing.  I think what we did was refer back to the President's words and say they stand.          Q  So don't they stand any longer?          Q  March 25th, Clinton said for the next four to five years it was ruled out.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, those words -- the President did say that in February.  The working groups are on a separate track, and as I said, I don't believe --          Q  Separate from the President?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't believe this has been presented to the President.          Q  Are they considering something that the President --          Q  Has ruled out?          Q     has ruled out?  I mean, will the President consider a VAT tax?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, the working groups have not presented this to the President.  They have looked at a wide range of options.  I suppose that if an argument is made, he will clearly listen to it.  That does not mean he has decided to do it.          Q  Can we put this another way?  In his answer in Ohio, he looked at the VAT in terms of restructuring the whole tax system.  Under those -- that was the circumstance that he said it might be considered at some future point.  Is that no longer the case, or is that the only way that he can see a VAT emerging?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I guess I'm not sure exactly what you're asking.          Q  He talked about the VAT in the context of a restructured tax system, not as a specific way to finance health care, for example.          Q  Or anything else.          Q  Or anything else.          Q  It was always in the context of substituting for other taxes at a time of a dramatic overhaul of the whole tax system.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.          Q  Has that change, too?          Q  Is that still his view?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I haven't spoken about those specific comments.  I think -- I can just go back to it -- are the working groups -- have they examined the possibility of a VAT?  Yes, they have.          Q  Certainly we're looking at a VAT, she said.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They have examined the possibility of a VAT.  Has it been presented to the President?  Has he made a decision?  No, he has not.          Q  What kind of a deal do you have when you've got the President's appointed task force, obviously not oblivious to his ruling something out except in the context of some huge down the line reform, goes ahead on its own and considers a tax which he has specifically ruled out in any context other than much later, and then goes ahead and announces that that's what they're looking at?  Is the President concerned about that sort of thing?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that the President's concern is to make sure he gets the best health care proposal possible.  He's concerned with making sure that they have the most thorough process for examining all the possible alternatives, all the different alternatives.  If a decision is made to go forward with something like that it's certainly something the President will explain and justify.  But no decision has been made along those lines.          Q  What does it mean exactly, though, when the President rules something out?  Does it mean it can get back on the table later if a more persuasive argument is made?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's just -- that's indisputably true.  If you -- but, at the same time, he has not ruled it in.  He has not made a proposal.          Q  What makes him open to it now when he wasn't open to it before?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's certainly willing to listen to the argument.          Q  Was he willing to listen to the argument for a short-term tax this year, and he wasn't willing to listen to it in Chilicothe?  He's now open to it --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The context of his comments was that it was not something -- he wanted to be clear that this is not something he was proposing, not something he was floating.          Q  Not something he was considering.  Those are his words -- "It's not something that's now under consideration.  If we start considering it, I'll tell you."  You're now acknowledging, are you not, that it is under consideration and --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm acknowledging that the task force has studied this proposal.  I am also stating that the President has not made a decision on it.          Q  But the door is open for the President to reconsider including this as part of --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously, the working groups are looking at it.  Again, but the President has not made a decision.          Q  Do you know if they will make a presentation on behalf of the VAT to him?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that.  I assume that if -- I don't know what stage they are it in proposing.  I don't know that they're going to make the conclusion that this is something they should present to him.  I know this is something the working groups are looking at.          Q  Do you understand, George, that none of us are asking these questions in context of a decision that the President has made, only about what the President is considering?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I understand that, and I am acknowledging that the working groups have examined the issue of a VAT.          Q  And the President will consider it?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I assume that he will consider the argument if it is presented to him.          Q  Does that mean the President -- that working groups think that when the President says no, he means maybe?  (Laughter.)          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that means that the working groups are trying to do the most thorough job possible.          Q  George, can I ask you another question about Bosnia?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.  (Laughter.)          Q  No, he wants us to stay on this.          Q  Let's do gays in the military.  (Laughter.)          Q  No, he got out of that swamp.          Q  I think we've gotten the bottom line on that VAT.  Reggie Bartholomew, your Special Ambassador in Belgrade, today said that if the Serbs do not accept the agreement that has been worked out -- quote -- "We will do our part to pursue the lifting of the arms embargo together with our allies."  That seems to go a bit further than what you've just said --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sounds almost exactly what I just said.          Q  Well, do you accept -- in other words, you accept what Reggie --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President has said that this is something that's under consideration.  It is something he will consider if the current actions don't bring the Serbs to the table.          Q  Isn't there some kind of timetable here?            MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, there is a timetable.  There's going to be a vote on the U.N. resolution in about 10 days.          Q  That's on sanctions, that's on tightening the sanctions.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's right, that's sanctions.  And we believe that that will ratchet up the pressure, and we hope that that will bring the Serbs to the table.  As you know, Mr. Bartholomew also met with Mr. Churkin of Russia, and they are also working on ways to bring the Serbs to the table.  We will continue to pressure them in many different ways and this is one possible option as well.          Q  The question is whether there's a timetable for consideration or a vote on a decision on lifting the arms embargo, not the sanctions.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The next vote in the U.N. is on sanctions.  As far as I know, there are no votes scheduled on lifting the arms embargo.  But it is something that we have discussed both internally and with our allies.          Q  Why did Reggie Bartholomew tell the Serbs that the U.S. would do that?  What was the point of his telling them that?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, clearly, I mean, this is something that's under consideration, and this is something that we take quite seriously if they do not come to the table.  They should know the consequences of failing to come to the table.          Q  Have they been given a deadline?          Q  Warren Christopher has been saying the same thing and it hasn't seemed to change the Serbs' behavior in the least.  Why should the Serbs take any heed of a threat to lift the arms embargo when so far everything that's been done has had no effect on the fighting in Bosnia?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't accept the premise of your question.  It has had an effect; the embargo is having an effect.            Q  What effect?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If the Serbians choose not to heed our warnings, then they will face the consequences.          Q  What effect has it had in Bosnia?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the effect that it has had on the Serbians, it has tightened up -- they are not getting their shipments through.  We can brief more fully --          Q  In Bosnia, George.  In Bosnia what effect has it had?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it's hard to say if it's stopped the aggression to date.  That is why we're continuing to press for the Serbians to stop.  But we believe that over time we will continue to weaken the Serbs and that will have   an effect.  I'm not saying it's going to happen overnight; it clearly hasn't happened overnight.  But we believe that over time the sanctions can weaken the Serbs.  If it fails to work and if the Serbs fail to come to the negotiating table, we'll move forward with the embargo.          Q  Isn't there a working deadline, George, of the 24th -- the same date as the U.N. -- the scheduled U.N. vote?  Hasn't the United States said, along with many of the other NATO allies, that if the Serbs aren't willing to sign on to the peace accord by then, that we'll seek -- haven't we said that we will seek --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We've said continually we're going to --          Q  But on that deadline?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't have a specific date, but we're going to move forward with the resolution, the U.N. resolution, by around that time.  And if that fails to take effect, if that fails to bring the Serbs to the table, we will clearly consider other actions.          Q  Isn't this awfully incremental?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're taking a step-by-step approach.  We're ratcheting up the pressure and we're going to continue to do that.          Q  Is there a possibility, George, that by the time all these incremental steps are taken the Serbs will have achieved their goals and then what's the purpose?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the purpose is to get the Serbs to stop the aggression.  We are pursuing that goal on many different fronts.  We are pursuing it through the U.N.; we're pursuing it through direct talks; we are pursuing it through tightening the sanctions.  And we will consider lifting the arms embargo.  We are turning the screws up on the Serbs and we will continue to do that.          Q  But if the efforts have been unsuccessful in getting the Serbs to stop the aggression how effective will any campaign be to have the Serbs give back what they've gained?  I mean, once they're entrenched --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't speculate on that.  We're going to continue to press for them to come to the table now.  We're going to continue to find ways to stop the aggression.  But I can't see into the future.          Q  George, on the stimulus package, House Republicans say they're going to hold a series of town meetings on Saturday to try and explain the details of your package.  They cite polls which show that the more people learn about it, the less they like it.  What's your strategy to counter that?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The strategy we have is the one we're going to continue.  As you saw, the President today pointed up the very real benefits of the summer jobs program that this package will provide:  700,000 new summer jobs this summer for kids in inner cities and suburbs to do productive work.  We are also going to point out the benefits of the highway money, the investments in highways.  We're going to point up the benefits of immunization.  We're going to point up the benefits of Head Start.  We are going to say that the Republicans have a choice:  they can take action to create jobs or they can perpetuate the gridlock of the last four years.           Q  Does it concern you, though, that the House now, the House Republicans are after you as well as the Senate?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The House Republicans voted against it before.  They made a mistake then; they're making a mistake now.          Q  George, does it strike anybody in the administration that it's a bit strong to describe, as the President did this morning, the summer jobs program as -- quote -- "a reaffirmation of a promise of America"?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  I think it's the promise of America to give kids a chance to reach their full potential.           Q  Government-funded jobs?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  To give people a chance to work?  Absolutely.  That is the promise of America.          Q  I want to follow up on something I asked yesterday -- where does 700,000 summer jobs, where does that figure come from?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is on top of.  I did look at it.  There are currently 600,000 summer jobs in the pipeline.  This will be on top of the 600,000, so it will be a total of 1.3 million.          Q  The 700,000 would be created by the stimulus package?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.          Q  Where does that number come from?  Because we've been told all along that the stimulus package would create 500,000 new jobs.  And according to Panetta, that breaks down to something like 200,000 full-time jobs and 150,000 summer jobs.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, but the summer -- that's when you do their full-time equivalence.  I mean, 700,000 individuals will receive jobs this summer.  When you calculate it for the full-time job effect, you have to do -- I don't know what the exact formula is.          Q  Seven hundred thousand part-time jobs --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- 150,000 or --          Q  One to four because it's three months.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Thank you.          Q  Can I follow up on that?  Did the President misspeak this morning when he said that some of the government money for these summer jobs will pay for private -- for kids to work in the private sector?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not necessarily.  I mean, I think that there will be grants available.  That's one of the ways that you pay for the jobs.  At the same time, he's also issued a challenge to the private sector to hire kids on their own as well.            Q  Tax dollars, for instance, would pay for kids to work at Time-Warner?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the Time-Warner is actually somebody coming forward and actually doing a grant.  That's going to be the bulk of it.  There could be isolated instances, though, where there would be grants to businesses.          Q  Has the President spoken with any Senate Republicans this week?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, but there's been a lot of contact with Senate Republicans in the White House.          Q  At a lower level.  But the President hasn't?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has not, no.          Q  Getting any closer to get the votes?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're continuing to work on it.           Q  Anybody leaning your way?          Q  On Haiti, The New York Times seems to be reporting something of a breakthrough in Aristide's attitude towards the coup leaders.  Can you confirm that there has been this change, and what impact will it have on the process?  And what did Pezzullo have to say yesterday in his report?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Pezzullo did brief the principals.  I can't confirm what's actually happening in the talks.  I would leave that to the negotiators themselves.  But Mr. Caputo has returned to Haiti.  We have received a briefing here at the White House from Ambassador Pezzullo.  And as we have said time and time again, we believe that assurances of security are important to a final resolution to a broader political settlement.          Q  George, yesterday you offered some selective breakdowns of how the stimulus would impact some states and cities.  Can we get a complete breakdown by state of how these jobs would be impacted?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we have it for most states, yes.  And I think we can get it out.          Q  Could you make that generally available?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe we can.          Q  And could you do it by the component of the stimulus?  In other words --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if we can do -- I know that we can do it by summer jobs and other jobs.  I don't know how deeply it can be broken down.  But clearly, we can break it down into summer jobs and other jobs.          Q  And can I follow up?  Is this the information that Jeff Eller and the rest of the White House is using in the ads in the states?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they're ads, but they're press releases.          Q  Can you describe what those press releases contain?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  All we're doing is pointing out the benefits of this package to various states.  For instance, I know that today Senator Dole is heading up to Vermont and New Hampshire.  And I would point out that the stimulus package, the jobs package creates 1,000 jobs in Vermont.  It creates 2,000 jobs in New Hampshire.  And the people of those states should remind him that this is important.           Q  Where are the releases going?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They go to the states.          Q  To whom?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We can get them.  It's no problem.          Q  Can we get it?          Q  Why don't you put them out here as well?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we can.          Q  This afternoon?  Would that be possible?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'll have to check.  I don't know.  But as soon as we can.          Q  Are you focusing these press releases on states where there are moderate or pragmatic Republican senators?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're trying to get as many as we can.  It's actually quite difficult to pull this together and we're doing our best.  We're putting them out as we get them.          Q  Why are you so closely tracking Senator Dole's schedule?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I was just following it.           Q  Are press releases going along to states where he's visiting?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure.  I think that probably there are press releases going to Vermont.  (Laughter.)          Q  Will there be a man in a chicken suit waiting?  (Laughter.)          Q  George, as the President goes about the business of defending what's in his stimulus package, he doesn't address what seems to be the Republicans' main point, that you're funding it with deficit spending rather than "if it's so important, why not come up with the funding for it" seems to be the Republican argument.  And how do you answer that?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What was answer is, we are paying for it over time.  And if you look at our budget, we pay for this package over time.  We believe right now the economy needs a jump-start for jobs.          Q  You're not claiming, are you, that that doesn't add to the deficit this year?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm saying we're paying for it over time.  I didn't say that.          Q  I know that, George.  But I mean, from the beginning, the question -- we do have annual budgets and things --deficit spending will pay for that this year, will it not?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  This year they clearly will.  But over time our budget fully pays for this program.          Q  What you're saying is that there are savings that would cover this if it were this year in future years?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  That's exactly what I said.          Q  I know that, but there is going to be outstanding debt, it will add to the national debt from this year --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, we're reducing the deficit by $500 billion -- $514 billion over the next four years.          Q  You mean you're reducing it below what it would have been?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Exactly.          Q  In fact, you're adding a very large amount to the national debt over the period of --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  But we're reducing it far more from what it would have been.  That's true.            Q  Washington-type reduction.  (Laughter.)          Q  You're getting to be a grumpy old man.          Q  George, has any decision been made about the White House or the President's participation in the gay rights march coming up in a week and a half?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on the President's schedule now.  I believe he's going to be at the Senate Democratic retreat in Jamestown that weekend.          Q  Will he address it by phone?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about that.  It's a little far out, but I believe he's going to be in the Senate retreat.          Q  So will he have the leaders in a day or two before the speech?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  I would expect that at some point he would meet with the leaders of some of these groups.  I don't know the schedule on it, though.          Q  Will there be an AIDS czar appointed prior to or in conjunction with the event?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.          Q  April 22nd is Earth Day.  What is the President going to do to mark that, and is it the case that he is going to sign the biodiversity treaty that day?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know there's been some work on the biodiversity treaty.  I don't know about signing it that day, but I would expect he'll have a statement on Earth Day or right around then.          Q  Where is the work on the biodiversity treaty?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'd have to check with Katie McGinty.  I just know that there's been some work done, but I don't know exactly what.          Q  When is Earth Day?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The 22nd, I think.          Q  Why is it you know that he is going to have a statement on Earth Day but you don't know if he's going to have a statement on the gay rights march?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I said I don't know if he's going to meet or when he's going to meet.          Q  Do you have a statement on the gay rights march?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't, actually, no.  I wouldn't be surprised if he did, though.          Q  Do you have some details on the Miyazawa visit?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a working visit on Friday and the President is looking forward to that in discussing a number of issues including Russian aid and the Japanese stimulus package and the trade issues between the two countries.          Q  There was some expectations that a second aid package to Russia was going to be unveiled at the G-7 meeting and, if I understand, it hasn't happened.  Why is that or what's the status on that?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The G-7 meeting is still going on and, as you know, Secretaries Bentsen and Christopher have talked about the outlines of a possible package.  But we're going to continue to consult with Congress and our G-7 allies on that.          Q?    We will not then make any kind of announcement during the two-day meeting?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The meeting's not over yet.            Q  Is that when you're going to make one?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not ruling out the possibility.          Q     the President's going to announce it tomorrow.          Q  Bentsen said that.          Q  Yes, Bentsen said it would be tomorrow.          Q  So did Christopher.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'd have to look at that, but I believe it is more likely that the announcement will come out of Tokyo.          Q  George, has there been further consideration here about going to -- sending the President out to Los Angeles?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that there's -- it's not something we've ruled out.  We don't have a date set for it.          Q  George, you all have a position or do you support Immigration's plan to settle 4,000 Iraqi prisoners in the United States?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the first I've heard of it.          Q  George, there was a report today about the --          Q  Fortunately.  (Laughter.)           Q     about the pace of appointments and says that President Clinton is behind President Bush in the number of positions that people have been nominated for.  Are you going to speed up the pace of nominations or where do you stand with it?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We filled 814 of the President's appointments.  And it's broken down -- we have 384 Schedule C; 147 noncareer SES; 213 PAS full-time.  I'm not sure what that means --(laughter) -- 70 PA full-time.  And this is about the same -- it's about the same pace of President Bush.  Obviously, as you move along farther, once you -- each level of appointment actually has a multiplier effect and frees up far more appointments.  So we expect the process to speed up.  But we're at the pace of Bush.  Obviously we'd like to get these done as quickly as possible.            I would point out that the FBI background checks and the background check is far more comprehensive and it takes more time than our predecessors, and that is part of the holdup.  But we're working on it.          Q  Is that because of Nannygate?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's an awful big part of it, yes.          Q  In the story this morning, you were at approximately the same pace as Bush in making appointments, but way behind in winning confirmations.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's where the background checks comes into play.  That's the problem.          Q  That's the background checks problem?  Because I mean, you have a Democratic Senate --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, that's not the -- you make the appointments, and then it takes quite a bit of time to fill out all the forms and have the background checks done.  That's exactly where the problem is.          Q  What's the President doing this afternoon, and what's on the plan for tomorrow?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's got some meetings -- just office meetings this afternoon for the most part, on a variety of issues that -- probably a half-dozen different issues.  And then he'll be -- tomorrow we'll have an event, probably again focused on the stimulus and jobs package out of here at the White House.  And Friday is the Miyazawa meeting.          Q  Will you be releasing his tax return tomorrow, George?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Either tomorrow or Friday.          Q  Is there going to be a pre-briefing regarding the Japanese Prime Minister's visit tomorrow?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about tomorrow, but we'll probably get something done, as we usually do, for these visits.          Q  Was Reverend Jackson here this morning and do you know what that was about?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He was here.  He met with a group of us here at the White House, including Mack McLarty.          Q  Who?          Q  Reverend Jackson.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Reverend Jackson.  Mack McLarty, me, Gene Sperling, Bruce Reed, Jeff Watson, Mark Gearan.           Q  Talking about Haiti?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We talked about general urban policy.  He is about to go to Los Angeles.  He was just back from Mississippi, where we had a good victory last night; and he's going on to Los Angeles.          Q  Did he request the meeting?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Actually, no.  He's in continual contact with the President.  He had written a letter on a variety of issues, and so we asked him to come in and talk about it.          Q  George, Dole is having a fundraiser for Jeffords tonight in Vermont.  Have you guys been  in contact with Jeffords at all on this?     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's been some contact, sure.          Q  Can you tell us about the contacts?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure --           Q  Do you know who contacted him or what was said?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that Howard Paster talked to him and they just has a general talk about the package.          Q  And did he express his support for it now, or is he --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't divulge the details of the conversation, but there have been conversations.          Q  The L.A. Times is reporting that abortion --elective abortions is likely to be included in the basic health care package.  Is this something the President is considering?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again --          Q  Along with the VAT?  (Laughter.)          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's certainly something that's been looked at, but no decisions have been made.          Q  What was the question?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The L.A. Times story on whether abortions will be covered by the President's health plan.          Q  Did the President in his meeting -- did you in your meeting with Reverend Jackson ask his advice, solicit his advice about what kind of stance the White House should take in the wake of the verdict in L.A.?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we certainly talked about the situation in Los Angeles and the long-term prospects for economic development and other issues.          Q  For instance, did you discuss whether it would be helpful for the President to go there or not?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we discussed a wide range of issues related to Los Angeles.  That was certainly one of them.          Q  Letting you perhaps go out on the way you came in, I need to go back to Bosnia just for a second and ask --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, good.          Q     your reaction to Margaret Thatcher's comments that you're just sitting by and watching a massacre.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, we've been pushing very hard on a number of fronts for more aggressive action.  We will continue to do that.          Q  Can you tell us if you've made any progress in your talks on the stimulus package getting a compromise?  I mean, we don't have any feel except talks are ongoing.  Have you talked to like 20 people or --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know the numbers.  We've talked to several people and we've had wide-ranging sessions.            Q  Anyone leaning your way?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't get into that.  We're just going to keep working through Tuesday.          THE PRESS:  Thank you.                                 END                    1:10 P.M. EDT     #56-04/14

Pricy OPEC oil impacts both Germany,Japan and many other "industrial rivals" more than these two.

How about these two:1.  Some of the survivors claimed that BD members poured fuel along thecorridors and set fire to it.  The speed at which the fire spreadis not inconsistent with this claim.2.  There was certainly a fire which killed most of the people in the compound.There is a very very good possibility that the FBI did not start thisfire.  This is a good reason to believe that the BD's did.3.  Even if the BD's were not contemplating suicide, it is very possible thatDavid Koresh was convinced (and thus convinced the others) that thiswas not suicide.  It was the fulfilment of a profecy of some sort.There are three possibilities other than the BD's self destruction:A.  They are not dead, but escaped via bunker,etc.  From reports of theinadequacies of the tunnels and the bodies found, I would rate thisas highly unlikely.B.  The fire was started by an FBI accident.  This is possible, but it would befoolish of us to declare this outright until more evidence can back it.Sure, it's possible that the armored vehicle knocked down a lanternwhich started the fire (why was there a lit lantern in the middle ofthe day near the edge of the complex?).  It's anecdotal evidence thathas been contradicted by other escapees.C.  The fire was started on purpose by the FBI.  This has been suggested bysome on the NET, and I would rate this possibility as utterlyludicrous.  This is what we in "sci.skeptic" would call an"extraordinary claim" and won't bother refuting unless someone givesany good evidence to back it up.So we are left with two reasonable possibilities.  That the fire was an FBIaccident and that the fire was started by the BD.  I find the latter morelikely based on the evidence I've seen so far.-- *Isaac Kuo (isaackuo@math.berkeley.edu)*       ___** _____/_o_\\_____*Twinkle, twinkle, little .sig,*(==(/_______\\)==)*Keep it less than 5 lines big.* \\==\\/     \\/==/

It'struely a sad day for religious freedom in this country.  The BranchDividians may have been nutty (my general opinion of all religious people),but tax evasion and illegal possesion of firearms are certainly not groundsfor destroying a people.The killing of the four BATF agents was surey a dispicable act, but that wasan escalation of the confrontation which the BATF started.  War is badprecisely because of humanity's tendancy for escalation.  That principleapplies to all cases of warfare- whether it's between nuclear superpowers,feuding families or fledgling religious groups and our federal govt.  Whywas warfare chosen as the course of action when patience and subtlety wouldalso have worked?  Why is the petty letter of the law more important thanpeoples' lives and religious beliefs?  Perhaps the supposed professionals inour federal law inforcement agencies are just plain stupid.It was interesting to watch the 700 club today.  Pat Robertson said that the"Branch Dividians had met the firey end for worshipping their false god." Healso said that this was a terrible tragedy and that the FBI really blew it. However, I still feel that he's forgetting that every major religion in theworld had a similarly humble 'cult-status' beginning- even, and perhapsespecially, christianity.  It is perhaps worthwhile to consider that theBranch Dividians' apocalyptic prophecies have been fulfilled.

She provoked Koreshinto killing the children.The situation in Waco was similar to a hostage situation with a madman holding a gun against the head of an innocent person.In such a situation, a person who provokes the madman and causes him to pull the gun's trigger is responsible for the death of thehostage.

Since then, President Clinton has directed that a number of steps be taken to move this process forward.  The Administration is announcing a number of steps today in order to underscore its deep commitment to a new and closer partnership with Russia based on its government's commitment to reform.Executive Review of Cold War LawsPresident Clinton and President Yeltsin discussed the desirability of reviewing and updating U.S. laws and regulations to reflect the end of the Cold War.  Congress has already acted to revise many laws to reflect the fact that a communist Soviet Union has been replaced by a democratic Russia and other independent states.  However, many laws and regulations remain that contain language and restrictions that fail to reflect the end of the Cold War and that unnecessarily undermine relations with Russia and the other new independent states.The President today has ordered an Executive review of laws and regulations so that, where appropriate and consistent with U.S. security and other national interests, such provisions can be revised or removed.  He has asked Ambassador-at-large Strobe Talbott to coordinate this review on an expedited basis.  The President has indicated that he will welcome congressional efforts to help this review proceed as quickly as possible.This review will weigh all considerations that pertain to revision of such provisions, and the initiation of the review may help to remedy some of the circumstances that have justified such provisions in the past.  For example, because the Russians are eager to have their status changed under the Jackson-Vanik legislation, President Yeltsin personally assured President Clinton in Vancouver that he would look into individual cases involving continuing restrictions on emigration from Russia.  By addressing such issues, this review can help strengthen the bonds of trust and partnership between the U.S. and Russia, and betweenthe U.S. and the other new independent states.Review of COCOMIt is also time to consider expeditiously with America's allies the future of another Cold War institution -- the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM).  The United States has begun a thorough review of how to reorient export controls to the post-Cold War world, in which Russia is no longer viewed as a potential adversary, but as a potential ally in combatting the proliferation of sensitive technology.Steps to Improve the Security RelationshipThe President also has taken steps to move ahead on a range of efforts discussed in Vancouver that can strengthen U.S. security and improve our security relationship with the Russians and the other states.Accelerated Deactivation of Nuclear WeaponsIn Vancouver, the two Presidents discussed accelerating the process of deactivating nuclear strategic systems scheduled for elimination under the START I Treaty.  President Clinton has directed the Department of Defense to complete this process well in advance of the seven year reduction period outlined in START I.  In addition, the United States, together with Russia and the other relevant states of the former Soviet Union, will be exploring programs under Nunn-Lugar to help them to accelerate this process.Multilateral Test BanThe two Presidents agreed at Vancouver that negotiations on a multilateral nuclear test ban should commence at an early date, and that the two governments would consult with each other accordingly.  The United States looks forward to beginning consultations with Russia, our allies, and other states, on the specific issues related to this negotiation.  The United States expects to start this consultative process within the next two months.    DetargetingThe two Presidents also began a dialogue on the issue of nuclear targeting at Vancouver.  As the United States and Russia move into a new relationship of strategic partnership, there is a need to reexamine many of the assumptions and means employed in the past to safeguard U.S. security against a nuclear adversary.  The Administration is beginning a comprehensive review of measures that could enhance strategic stability, including recent proposals for detargeting nuclear missiles.   Other Measures to Create a New Security RelationshipIn response to the incident involving a collision between US and Russian submarines last month, Secretary Aspin will be ready to discuss ways to avoid such incidents in the future with Russian Defense Minister Grachev during his visit to the United States in late May.Secretary Aspin will also be prepared to move forward with Defense Minister Grachev in May to develop a combined training program between our two military forces and to prepare for joint exercises in peacekeeping, such as that authorized by the UN Security Council.  The United States looks forward to broadening such training and exercises to include other peacekeeping contributors, in order to improve inter-operability, readiness, and planning for multilateral peacekeeping operations.  The US and Russia are working together to convene a May Ministerial Meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss proposals for enhancing the UN's peacekeeping capability and to move consideration of the Secretary-General's Agenda for Peace from the discussion to the implementation phase.  The U.S. is also working with the Russians to focus specifically on improvements in the financing and management of UN operations.  The purpose of these initiatives will be to cooperate on peacekeeping for our participation in UN or CSCE sponsored actions.Multilateral and Bilateral Partnership with ReformFinally, the Administration continues to move ahead on a range of initiatives aimed at striking a partnership with economic and political reformers throughout Russia and the other states.  The Administration is continuing work with our G-7 partners to assemble the package of multilateral assistance that Secretaries Bentsen and Christopher recently negotiated in Tokyo.  And the Administration is continuing consultation with Congress over the further efforts the U.S. will take to assist the process of reform in Russia and the other states.                           *    *    *The Administration believes these steps can increase American security while improving the relationship between the U.S. and Russia, and between the U.S. and the other new independent states.                               -30-

(I won't necessarily defend himon other issues.)  There were NEVER any specific projects included in the CommunityDevelopment Block Grant portion of the President's proposal.  CongressionalRepublicans, in an effort to discredit the stimulus package, selected whatthey felt were silly sounding projects from a wish-list of POTENTIAL projects prepared by the US Mayors' Conference before the stimulus packagewas ever proposed.  (The document in question was designed to pressure theWhite House to increase the size of the block grant proposal submittedto Congress.  It didn't work.)The $2.56(?) billion proposed in the stimulus package came nowhere closeto covering the total estimated cost of the original wish-list.  If itwere passed, communities would have to select which projects to fund andat what level.In the case of Spokane, Wa., Tom Foley's home district, no one everexpected to be able to refurbish a local swimming pool (one of the Republicans' examples) FROM THE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE STIMULUSPACKAGE since the estimated cost of doing so exceeded the total amount of block grant funds the city would receive from the stimulus package for ALL projects.  The plan, instead, was to use the money on public housing constructionand remodeling to cope with a severe housing shortage.  (Yup, there areplaces where that is true.)  The swimming pool improvements were near thebottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city.  The $3 millionor so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressingpriorities.If the block grants are cut from the stimulus package, it is these projectsthat will be affected by the lack of funds.  And that is why the Clintonadministration has been publicizing the issue.A final point.  One may or may not like community block grants.  It isworth noting, however, that Congressional Republicans' opposition to themis new.  Since the Nixon administration, Republicans have generally supported such grants as an alternative to targeted federal spending,arguing that local governments are far better able to determine spendingpriorities than "Washington bureaucrats."  Is it clear now?  Or is this all too complicated to understand?jsh--Steve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM   "One thing about data, it sure does cut|  UUCP:    ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh the bulls**t." - R.

It is >discriminatory that I cannot make that choice, and so you must pay for it."  >That a person has a right to make a choice does not imply legally or >otherwise that someone else should Foot the Bill [sic] for that choice.Ok, look.  It's like this.  We *are* footing the bill.  Maybe they willtake choice A.  Maybe they will take choice B.  Maybe they will take choiceC.  They can't afford any *one* of them.  If they take choice A we'd haveto pay them, say $5.  If they take choice B it would cost us $20.  If theytake choice C it will cost us $20 now and a hell of a lot more for the next18 years.  Which one sounds the most realistic for us to be willing to payfor?  Now some people happen not to like choice A.  Other people happennot to like choice C (paying for it, that is).  C has been around and paidfor for years.  Even though it means we spend a lot of money, we can't inconscience refuse to pay for it.  Now A has been around and is perfectlylegal, but it hasn't been funded in the past.  Now A is going to be fundedbut some people object.  They don't like the idea of their tax money goingto pay for choice A.  So we could refuse to fund A at all.  Then thosewomen who can't afford any of those choices will be forced to take choiceB or C, which will cost *all of us* more money.  Most of us don't see anyreason at all why *more money* should be spent to the effect of *removingpersonal choice* from some women.  The alternative is to fund A if that iswhat the mother chooses.  We will also still fund B and even C if *that*is what the mother chooses.  However, some women will certainly choose A,and that will then save us $15 we otherwise would have had to spend.  Your"taxes" are not being raised to fund a choice you object, they are being*lowered* because we will fund a choice that is *legal*, despite yourobjections to it.  (Actually, your taxes are not really going to go down,as I'm sure you would point out.  But the amount that is saved in thatarea can help out in another--like our massive debt.)>>If you disagree then give us some "reasons".  Given that abortion is>>*LEGAL* and the right to abortion is supported by the majority of the>>population ...>>...it is not justifiable to refuse abortions to women who can not afford>>them, who will simply require even greater funds for the delivery you>>would force upon them.  I refuse to pay *more taxes* to remove choice>>from those women just because you object to a legal medical procedure.>WHAT?>I say objection to the procedure is irrelevant.  Uncle Bill doesn't pay for >breast augmentation, facelifts, etc...  Why abortions?  It's elective >surgery!  Those other procedures you mention only cost money.  There is no savingsin other procedures that would be required down the road without them.(In fact, there could be additional costs down the road *because* of them.)This is quite different from the case of abortion.>As for your argument, you are enticing a young girl to kill a baby by making >it affordable and refusing to make the alternative affordable too, SO YOU >ARE JUST AS GUILTY OF REMOVING A CHOICE BY WITHHOLDING FUNDS!  Think about >it.  A poor girl is pregnant and abortions are federally funded, what's she >gonna do.  What choice have YOUR PLANS given her.  Your kind of double->talk really makes me ill.This is bullshit.  We are *not* refusing "to make the alternative affordabletoo".  If we refused to pay for the more expensive choice of birth, *then*your statement would make sense.  But that is not the case, so it doesn't.If Clinton tried to block funding for pre-natal care and delivery (or leftit out of his health-care plan), I would certainly object.  I would also bequite surprised.>"Pro-choice".  Ha!

Even with easy adoption, there is stillthe fact that pregnancy takes several months.  Months in which a young womancould need to be getting an education.  (like finishing High School, enteringcollege, finishing college, getting a job...things that are much harder todo if you have to "take a break" for a few months...things that have a massiveimpact on her future productivity.)>>have a "right to life".

It is theminimal conceivable requirement, yet many people seem to think that somethingwithout awareness could still be important enough to justify the suffereingof a true member of society.  I keep asking, but I still haven't seen a realjustification for why the life of a non-sentient creature should be worth thesuffering of a sentient being.  (I haven't read every response on the threadsI've been asking on, yet, so we'll see if I see one later.)>>They have no experiences in the "real world" to make up a personality.>This is also true of quite a few Unix programmers.

Where did _that_ topic come from and what's it got to dowith the discussion at hand? :-)When I was discussing the concept of different criminal laws for crimesagainst different classes of people (and yes, I do consider laws whichallow/mandate enhanced penalties following conviction based upon theconvict's attitudes towards the class membership of the victim to fitinto that category), the category of classes I had in mind was that ofthe standard civil rights discussion -- classes based upon race, gender,ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, etc.  Having you ask aboutclasses based upon one's _profession_ rather than one's personalcharacteristics caught me off guard, and I had to think out the questionfrom scratch.What I finally decided was that the law should not recognize suchclasses because to do so would be to formally and officially declaresome people to be of more worth than others, and that would be anathemato the underlying American concept of equal treatment under the law.Last year, when a federal crime bill was under consideration which wouldhave expanded the federal death penalty to an additional fifty-pluscrimes, including the murder of various federal officers hitherto notprotected by that "aura of deterrence," critics pointed out theabsurdity of having laws which made the death penalty available for themurder of a federal postal inspector but not for ther murder of acivilian teacher, when the latter [arguably] provided a much morevalueable service and therefore would be the greater loss to society.This was an emotionally compelling argument, but even the proponents ofthat viewpoint appeared to tacitly assume that the state should judgesome lives as being more valuable than others on the basis of their"contribution to society."  I view that doctrine as being both (a)personally repugnant and (b) repugnant to the Equal Protection clause ofthe 14th Amendment.Accordingly, I believe that there should be no laws which give anyprofession-based class of people special protection (via the mechanismof supplying stronger statutory deterrence of crimes against members ofthat class), not even police officers, federal officers or high-rankingmembers of the Executive Branch of the federal government.-- William December Starr <wdstarr@athena.mit.edu>

In fact, "hi'ipoi", the Hawaiianword for "cherish" means "sharing food".  The Great Mahele, in whichthe Islands were divided up more-or-less evenly between the rich andthe poor, was a white man's idea.  In Africa, villagers will oftenshare tools, crops, and clothing with other members of their own villageand neighboring villages.  Every anthropologist who has ever been toAfrica has at least one tale of the difficulties arising from the so-called "theft" of the scientists possessions -- two concepts of which,until the visitors came along, the natives had no understanding.These are the people we call "savages".On the other hand, car-jackings and muggings are up from last year.Dov, before you make further comment on this thread, I think it wouldbehoove you to study *all* of the facts.-garison

Typical response: lack of logic.Define 'deviant':  someone who deviates from the normal.  Ok, so far.Define 'normal':   erm, umm.  If you define yourself as normal then it is foryou to prove that you are (within limits, which then brings in the question,what are the limits?

Wow!You must define what you say such that everyone agrees.  Here you have usedthe phrase "sexual deviant".  How in the hell do you define that?  As someonewho does something sexually that _you_ don't?  By this definition you mostprobably mean the majority of the planet.  How do you know that your nextdoor neighbour doesn't like custard to be spread over his genetalia thenhave it licked off by his wife?  Is this sexual deviancy?  How do we knowthat you don't like something sexually which others may find repulsive?  Is having sex doggy fashion a sexual deviancy?  Please be more specific, andwhere you do, back up your claims.  Or I may have to go to hospital due tolaughing too much at yours and Clayton's postings.Secondly, if we assume for the moment that the phrase 'sexual deviant' meanssuch people as homosexuals, bisexuals &c. (basically everyone you don't like),I think that your phrase "do not comprise a `political minorit[y]`" (why thebrackets?) is a non-sequiteur.  Gay groups exist which lobby their governments.That is a fact.  Prove it false.  Hence they are a politial group.  You state that they are not a political minority.  Are they therefore apolitical majority?  I think you boobed really big on this one.

In addition, it requirs anyonewith a used car dealer's license to own at least 10 cars at a time, all thetime. Let me continue with this example and try to answer Steve's questions.Steve, let's say you have the talent and inclination to fix up and resellcars.  Either you've gotten good enough at it in your spare time to bumpup against these limits, or you would like to do it full-time but thesestupid, arbitrary laws prevent you from starting out small and pullingyourself up.  So I'm protected from a hungry neighborhood competitor willingto take a low profit while working extra hard to fulfill my needs, and you'reprotected from doing what you want with your life.Here's what I see libertarianism offering you:Your money is truly yours; it belongs to you.  You can use it to buy a car.If you use it to buy a car, it is truly your car; it belongs to you.  Youcan use your money to fix up that car.  Since it is your car, you can sellthat car.Your life is truly yours; it belongs to you.  It matters not if someonethinks that it's "wrong" for you to buy and sell 10 cars within 12 monthsrather than, say, 9 cars.  They may dissaprove, but it is not their life ortheir money, it is your life and your money.My money is truly mine; it belongs to me.  I can use it to buy a car.Perhaps your car.  Perhaps that 10th car, the one that someone, somewheredissaproves of you selling and, presumably, of me buying.That someone could go to the government and insist that the government makeus stop it.  But the government would be powerless to stop us from doingwhat we like with our own property, in the abscence of fraud or agression.And it would be powerless to stop us from associating with each other.This does not seem to me to be a utopian dream, but basic human decencyand common sense.  A real grass-roots example of freedom and liberty.And yes, not having a few people acting as our masters, approving orrejecting each of our basic transactions with each other, does strike meas a wonderful way to improve the human condition.   Thanks awfully,             Patrick

The government provides free health care to all U.S. >residents. And there are no out-of-pocket costs. Wrong.  In better EC countries that use pure (but public) healthinsurance (like we use in Canada) rather than self-enclosed HMO-likesocialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementaryinsurance and/or copayments.  France Magazine's Summer 1992 editionhas a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage,including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days,you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital andbe covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  Thepublic insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amountfor a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket oraccording to your supplementary private insurance.  Over 2/3rds ofFrench have some form of extra private insurance.  So, 30% of healthcosts in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from othertaxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expendituresfor total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figurefor the U.S.That the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fundis to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such backin Canada (to make the Canadian insurance look more like real healthinsurance -- which actually it is).  The new Reform Party, a breakoffof traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly "libertarian"faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but thatjust a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the averageCanadian/European is more fiscally naive than their Americancounterparts on issues like these).I'm one of the few people who favour copayments (forget aboutleftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadiannewsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, 'cos the 100%insurance payment is hidden (unlike in France) and if you didn't knowit, you'd believe it actually is socialized medicine (Americanconservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones whoseriously call it that).  Canadians aren't worried about theAmericans, who spend 14%; we're worried about the French and Germanswho spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things thatshouldn't be paid for out of general funds like physicals forinsurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc.  The reason thatthe Canadian health insurance hasn't spiralled out of control despitebeing open and universal is that unlike Americans, there is no urge tospend all of your benefits' worth, and more if you can ... we're adifferent culture.>Like the play or pay model, managed competition leaves in place two >elements of the current health care system that reformers most often >criticize: the private, for-profit insurance industry; and the >employer-based system of coverage. Managed competition compels >employers to enroll their workers in large pools of health insurance >customers. Entire industries may, for example, sponsor a pool or >network. Insurance companies, doctors, hospitals and other health >care providers then bid for the pool's business, competing- in >theory- on the basis of price and quality. "Managed Care" relies on HMO's, which are unknown in most westernnations that use only public health insurance like Canada, Franceand Germany (I'm Canadian, and my German father-in-law-to-be saysof HMO/NHS approaches, "We left that behind with East Germany!").Sure, HMO/NHS controls costs because you have managers stranglingdoctors with budget strings.In Canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in Franceand Germany, with all private doctors and both private and publichospitals.  It is all pure insurance without HMO's.  The divisionsare different, with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked"sickness funds" over a century old while Canada divides by theirprovinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with thedoctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.)With such an open-ended system, it's no surprise that Canada is #2 tothe U.S. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go. TheFrench and Germans use the same approach but have larger populationsin more compact geography to improve scales of economy.gld--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Gary L.

The Branch Davidians have occupied the Mt.Carmel location for some years, and their neighbors (you know, the peoplenext door) have said to a man, that the BD folks were quiet and neverbothered anybody.There were some defector from the BD who alleged child abuse within themovement, but how does this bring in the Feds? In particular what interestwould ATF have in child abuse. O.K. It was the allegation of possesingillegal automatic weapons.  A search warrant could have been obtained(properly) only on probable cause. This means that some evidence that anillegal auto weapon was shipped in, or an illegal kit for convertingsemi-auto weapons to full automatic was purchased or shipped.In either case, how does this require an NO-KNOCK warrent, with a bunch ofmacho hot dog assholes busting into the place *without* identifyingthemselves. Milleniests tend to be a bit paranoid anyway. It is nosurprise they shot when invaded. Hell I am not a religious extremist and Imight have done the same myself. If the DEA busted into my house bymistake without identifying themselve and I had a gun in my hand, I wouldshoot first and wonder later.So if it was illegal guns, the ATF should have gotten a normal warrant(how can you flush a 50 calibre machine gun down the toilet?) andpresented it in a peaceful normal way. David Koresh has had brushes withthe law, even standing trial for attempted murder in which he wasacquitted. In every prior brush with the law, Koresh and his people actedpeacibly. There was no prior action on the part of the BD folks toindicate that they were any danger to society.NOTE: The question of whether the BD people were religious extremists orslight daft is totally irrelevant.

I believe it was posted onApril 18 or 19.The second part is a definition of a person.  A simplistic explanation isthat a "person" is a member of society.  Most normal adult human beings aregood examples of "people".  Most children over two years old are "people" aswell.  The simple way of determining this is that you can have a conversationwith them.  It is actually more complicated than that, but I have no desireto spend the time it would take to explain it to you.

By working together "with good will on both sides", we may beable to start solving problems without restricting anyone's freedoms.Mr. Walz on the other hand is using Rohit's post as an excuse forpersonal attacks on Mr. Cramer.

Before, the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) were justMembers of National Parliaments (MNPs) elected by and from among their peers.In the European Parliament, every Member State has a fixed number of seats,which increases less than proportionally with the population. Once in fiveyears, a general European election is being held, in which the citizens of allMember States choose their representatives to the European Parliament. Nextelections are due in 1994.Now the voting system for these European elections still differs from onecountry to another. Although the European Treaty enabling the direct electionof the MEPs requires a uniform voting system, up to now every country has justused its own system, more or less the same one used for national elections.British MEPs are elected in a first-past-the-post system with one MEP perdistrict; nearly all other States have chosen a system with proportionalrepresentation. But then in some countries (France, Italy) MEPs are allowed tobe a MNP as well, whilst in others they are not (Belgium, Netherlands).The European Parliament is now working on a uniform election system for itsown members, so that every candidate should have the same regulations tocomply with, regardless of the Member State (s)he wants to be elected for. Iwould like to know what you people out there think of the following questions:1. Do you think it is necessary to have uniform regulations or should everyMember State continue to use its own regulations (for European elections thatis)?2. Do you think a system of majority voting should be implemented, with one ormore MEPs per district, or would you prefer a system with proportionalrepresentation (for the whole of the Community or per state, per region, perdistrict?).3. Do you think the European Commission (or just its president) should bedirectly elected too, or should it be appointed by the European Parliament, orby the joint Member State governments as it is now?4. The Maastricht Treaty allows subjects of Member States to stand forelection in another Member State they are residing in. Do you think you wouldor could vote for a foreigner if his/her ideas appeal to you?5. Do you think MEPs should be allowed to be a member of a national parliamentor a regional parliament too? Or a member of a national or regional governmentbody?6. The European Parliament now has meetings in both Strasbourg and Brussels.MEPs themselves are for a complete move to Brussels in great majority, butpolitical compromises between the governments of the Member States stick tothe status quo. Do you approve of this or do you think the European Parliamentshould meet in one city only, and if yes, which?Please post your answers to eunet.politics, to which all followups areautomatically directed. If you do not have access to that group, please mailyour answer directly to me and I will post it for you.I hope many of you will take the time to post their views on this matter.--Roland Siebelink - Lokaal B.034          Centrum voor de Studie van NieuweVrije Universiteit Brussel SCOM/NMIT     Media, Informatie en TelecommunicatiePleinlaan 2 - 1050 Brussel - Belgium     Tel. direkt:  +32.2.641 24 15E-mail <rcsiebel@vnet3.vub.ac.be>        Tel. centrum: +32.2.641 24 12Talk <rcsiebel@is2.vub.ac.be>            Fax centrum:  +32.2.641 28 61

One approach is simply to try and move political opinionand hope a new more libertarian consensus lasts for a while.  Anotherapproach is to try and amend the constitution.  The originalconstitution restrained the U.S. government from economic interventionfor 100 to 150 years, depending on just how one wants to count it.The First Amendment, though weakened in many ways, still restrainsgovernment (particularly state and local), even though on manyparticular issues the majority is in favor of censorship.  I thinklibertarians would be happy with another 100 years of restraint viaan amendment or two (not that I think that's likely to happen).Not necessarily Mr. Hendricks, but other posters seem to see this asa problem with libertarianism, that it cannot be stable.  That mightbe true, but it is not an objection to libertarianism per se.  Ifa libertarian political consensus forms for a decade or two and thenfalls apart again, we would just be back where we are now.  This isunlike the case for socialism where a socialist consensus that heldfor a while and then fell apart would not leave us where we are now,but instead with lots of bureaucracy that would be hard to get rid of,if not tyranny as the end condition of a strong socialist consensus.-- Ervan Darnell                                        ervan@cs.rice.edu

Israel should also maintain a presence in theJordan valley.>If so (for those of you who support it), why were so>many settlers moved into the territories?  If it is not temporary,>let's hear it.There are a number of reasons for people to move (they werenot moved, but chose to move) into disputed areas.  Note that sincethese moves were made by free willed human beings, not "settlers," Iwill address two aspects of your question, why the government wouldallow &/or encourage them to move, and second why they did move.The government had a number of reasons for encouraging peopleto move across the green line.  They included security and politics.The first reason was security.  A large Jewish presense makesit difficult for terrorists to infiltrate.  A Jewish settlements alsoact as fortresses in times of war.A second reason was political.  Creating "settlements" broughtthe arabs to the negotiation table.  Had the creation of new towns andcities gone on another several years, there would be no place left inIsrael where there was an arab majority.  There would have been noland left that could be called arab.The fact that there are a hundered thousands Jews in placechanges the face of any peace settlement, and restricts what land canbe given away.Individuals who crossed the green line had several reasons fordoing so.  They include financial, religious, and political reasons.Many of the communities created were "bedroom" communities.Suburbs.  A house 20 minutes outside of Tel Aviv cost half less if itwas on the wrong side of the green line.  People who moved therewanted a decent home at a nice price.Some of the communites created were religious.  They builttheir neighborhoods in areas where there were jews until the riots ofthe 30's and 40's.  There are communities like this in Hebron, Gaza,and all over.  There are also communities built near religious sites.The last reason people moved was to establish a politicalJewish presense outside the green line.  They built communities tocontrol important intersections, important hilltops, roads, and otherplaces.The point is, there are many reasons people moved over thegreen line, and many reasons the government wanted them to.  Whateverstatus is negotiated for disputed territories, it will not be an "allor nothing" deal.  New boundaries will be drawn up by negotiation, notbe the results of a war.AdamAdam Shostack        adam@das.harvard.edu"If we had a budget big enough for drugs and sexual favors, we surewouldn't waste them on members of Congress..."   -John Perry Barlow

You believethat the courts, in deciding a civil dispute between two parties, shouldconsider as a factor -- perhaps as an overriding factor -- issues whichI believe the court should ignore as being irrelevant to the dispute._Boomer v.  Atlantic Cement Co._ was an action brought by one party,Boomer, whose property rights were being violated on an ongoing basis byanother party, the Atlantic Cement Company.  The facts supportedBoomer's contention that Atlantic Cement was wrongfully damaging hisproperty, and Boomer asked the court to order Atlantic Cement to stopdoing so.  End of story.  There was no reason for the court to considersuch issues as what a capitalistic society would want Atlantic Cement todo or whether the cost of compliance was disproportionate to the damagefaced by the plaintiffs.  Those issues had nothing to do with the casebefore the court.> Bill, if the government had stepped in and the EPA made a regulation> requiring multi-million dollar cement plants to be shut down because> of a smattering of cement dust, at a cost-benefit ratio of 15+:1,> you'd be up in arms.

Quite the contrary, I'dprobably support the action, since it would be based on the same generaldoctrine as the decision that I believe would have been correct in_Boomer_: the idea that people's property rights should not be violatedfor reasons of economic efficiency.  In _Boomer_ it was Boomer'sproperty rights which I believe the court should have protected; in thehypothetical EPA ruling you've presented, it's the American people'scollective property rights in a healthy physical environment.

So what?  The courts are supposed to protect the specific rightsof individuals, not the general interests of some nebulous society.  Ifsociety can have its cement plant without violating anyone's rights,fine.  Otherwise society will somehow have to limp along with one lesscement plant.

Which "one" are youspeaking of?  _I_ want the legal regime to protect people's rights.Besides, Coase's Theorem only has real application in the never-neverland of perfectly rational actors.  In the real world (1) some peopleare going to be stubborn, ornery, spiteful or otherwise "irrational"from a economic point of view and (2) the purpose of the courts is toprotect their right to be so.  I don't care if you can show me logicallythat your cattle are only doing $100 of damage to my property per head,so I should rationally sell you grazing rights to my land for, say, $150per head -- I still retain the right to tell you that I just plain don'twant any damned cattle on my property, not at any price.*   *   *   *   *>> And then you say: "Everyone's property rights were protected; the>> plaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were>> avoided."

Why should we treat a nuisance> plaintiff any different than any other tort plaintiff?  We don't> require specific performance in the analogous contractual situation;> why in tort?Last question first: For the same reason as in contract law -- becauseto do so would come dangerously close to treading on the ThirteenthAmendment.As to your "Then, by your argument, no tort plaintiff is ever madewhole, because the award of damages in involuntary" claim, you're atleast partially right.  Faced with situations in which the wrong hasalready been done and the damage to the victim has already taken placeand cannot be reversed or undone, courts will try to set an equitableprice tag on the loss suffered by the victim and require the wrongdoerto pay this price (rather than an inflated price which the victim mightprefer).  In these cases, the "sale" has already taken place and isirreversible, and the court simply tries to ensure that a fair price ispaid, under the doctrines that (a) only in certain circumstances shouldeven a civil wrongdoer be forced to pay punitive or excessive prices and(b) even a genuine victim should not profit in an unjustified orinequitable manner from his victimhood.  Both of these doctrines may beworth discussing or debating elsewhere, but neither is relevant to caseslike _Boomer_ in which the wrongful act and the loss stemming from itare still in the future and _can_ be reversed/undone (i.e., preventedfrom happening at all) by order of the court.In these types of cases, all the court has to do is require that thepotential victim's property rights are protected until and unless heagrees to sell them at a mutually-acceptable price.

Thefact that the proprietors of the Atlantic Cement Co. got themselves intoa position in which they found themselves over this barrel is simply aresult of their own poor business decision to start up a cement plantwithout _first_ trying to negotiate with Boomer and everyone else whoseproperty rights they'd be violating via the operation of their plant.There's nothing punitive or unjust about it.>> (2) It is "completely sensible" only if you believe that the alleged>> right of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid>> losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and>> the alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to>> not have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who>> own property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement's wrongful acts.>> [wdstarr]>> Anybody who ever commits a wrongful act should disgorge their entire> set of possessions to wronged person?

To add some relevance to|>the group in which I happen to be reading this, the U.S. government|>circa 1800 could not have created laws such as present Federal|>gun-control legislation.  Was it not a state?Yes because it has always had that power. The constitution limits the areasin which the government can exercise power. The constitution can be changedhowever and has been frequently. For example during prohibition the government had no power to permit alcohol to be sold although the state hadthe capacity to change the constitution to enable this.The constitutional provisions are merely a matter of form that dictatethe manner in which power is exercised. No piece of paper can preventabuse, for example the imprisonment of the socialist presidential candidatefor opposing world war I - a clear breach of the first ammendment,The United States clearly has the capacity to bring in meaningful armscontrol measures. If there were large groups of powerful warlords who couldprevent such a measure by force we would have to admit that the powerof the federal government to uphold the constitution was limited. Thisis the situation in Somalia where the state is unable to govern becausethe people with the guns think that they have the right to decide thelaw.|>>You have a very confused notion of what a state is.

But|>saying that "a state is a governing body" does not mean that it is|>the only sort of a governing body, unless one plays semantic games|>like, "if a state didn't create it, it's not really a law".The problem is extrapolating from our notions of what a state is whichdate from the treaty of Westphalia to the medieval period where countrieswere much more analogous to bodies like the EEC or the UN - organisationswhere individual members had significant powers in their own right anddid not derive their power from a central authority.|> The|>canonical example of non-governmental law is probably the Law|>Merchant, which others can expound upon better than I.  But it was|>certainly enforced in non-state courts for some time, although state|>courts, being subsidized, later were able to effectively enter the|>arbitration business.But here we are not talking of a time where law was voluntary. The rulesand regulations settled in this manner were in areas that the state was not involved in. Even today a great deal of law is effectivelymade in this manner. For example the city of London stockmarket which isa non governmental body that can make and enforce rules. It does so howeverwithin the framework laid down by the government.In medieval times this framework existed in preciosely the same manner. Ifyou were to set up shop as a trade association and decide to screw themonarch you could expect to end up inside the tower in a very shorttime. Most of the organisations allowed to make law have explicit RoyalCharters, such as the Universities for example. Fairs and towns all required authority in order to trade. It was customary however for this authorityto be granted on a permanent basis subject to revocation in the case ofmisbehavior. After Magna Carta the monarch lost the power to removeprivillage without recourse to the courts. Tony Benn recently establishedthrough a devious route the power of the Parliament to revoke favourswithout recourse to the courts - thus establishing the right to abolishthe house of lords for example.Certainly none of the rules set up by merchants forms any part of the "common law" which has a very specific meaning in the UK. It is lawmade by the judiciary through judgements on cases. Nothing else iscommon law.Incidentaly the common law is a lot more common than people expect. Forexample a judgment in common law made in England can effect the interpretation of the law in most of the countries that were once inthe Empire, including the US, the reverse is also true. For example alot of the decisions surrounding AIDS cases in the US are of relevanceto UK decisions. Although the statues are different the reasoning thatlies behind the interpretation of those statues is common and thus ifa judge made a reasoned assesment of the interpretation of the law inone jurdisdiction it would clearly be perverse if another country with noguiding precedent should judge a person to be guilty of a crime whichthey might by the existence of a precedent consider to be legal. The lawshould be as predictable as possible and abhors making decisions withoutprecedent. Once a decision is made in the UK though that naturally is superior in UK law.Phill Hallam-Baker.

EDT               MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, the President is going to come out at 1:15 p.m.  With your indulgence, I think what we'd like to do is have the President award the National Teacher's Award first and then have the teacher leave, or whatever, and then he'll make a statement on Waco and take a couple questions.  So if we can just hold off going live and all that until that's done, it probably will work out a lot better.           Q  If you'll give us the time.  That's the problem.          Q  We've got a two-minute warning problem.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, it is a problem.  It's about 1:15 p.m.          Q  The teacher would walk off and then --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's -- I'm just trying to work this out here.  I think that's the best way to handle it.          Q  Can I ask you a series of questions about the way the President handled the notifications yesterday?           MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.          Q  Did you, for instance, talk to the Justice Department about who would come out and discuss what had happened in Waco and whether it should be the Attorney General or the President?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Why don't we just take a step even farther back from that and look at the whole sequence of events on the contact between the Justice Department and the White House.  As you know and as we've said, the President spoke with the Attorney General on Sunday, Sunday afternoon.  They had a good discussion, about 15 minutes.  The Attorney General informed the President of what she wanted to do.  He raised no objections.  Obviously, she had the implicit authority from the President to go forward.  He raised no objections.  She went forward.  They had a discussion of a general nature about the incident.          Again, yesterday morning around 11:00 a.m., the President spoke with the Attorney General again.  They had a brief discussion over what was happening in Waco.  As you know, this was before the fire broke out at the compound.  And I think that was why there was some -- just some confusion.  I think that she was confusing in her minds before and after the fire, not the actual day when they spoke.            Then there was a number of contacts at a number of different levels in the White House yesterday afternoon between the Justice Department and the White House.  They were informing us of \ftheir decisions, what they would like to do.  There was an FBI briefing in Waco.  The Attorney General had her press conference.  The President then issued a statement after that.          Frankly, yesterday afternoon, you know, there was a fair amount of confusion over exactly what was happening on the ground in Waco, and I think that we wanted to be very careful not to have the President say anything until we had a much better sense of what was actually happening on the ground.  Once we were fairly clear on what was happening on the ground in Waco, the President issued a statement.  He spoke with the Attorney General again yesterday evening.          Q  At what hour was that?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It was quite late.  I believe it was after he returned from the Holocaust Museum.  He took a tour of the Holocaust Museum last night.          Q  And he went out to dinner.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe briefly.  Yes, he went to dinner and then he spoke with the Attorney General last night.  I don't know the exact time; I think it was relatively late.  And he just said, I think as Dee Dee has reported, that he just wanted to tell her that he thought she handled a difficult situation very well, that she did a good job in a tough situation, and that she should try and get some sleep.  He then, again, spoke with her this morning about the follow-up in Waco, and about what they're going to do this afternoon.  As you know, the President will have an announcement to make at 1:15.          Q  Did he ever talk with Webb Hubbell yesterday, last night, or this morning?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, no.          Q  Was Webb Hubbell the point man for the White House?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Webb Hubbell is the general White House Liaison and several people talked to Webb.  The Attorney General was running the operation.          Q  Did he tell her that she should sleep well, that she had done a good job?  Or he just tell her that she should get some sleep?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think sleep well -- done a good job -- I don't know the exact words.  I think that sounds right.          Q  I mean, sleep well has implications as to conscience and whether she should feel badly about it or not.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think everybody feels badly when you have a situation when --          Q  I understand that, but whether the issue of blame is brought up in that phraseology.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's the spirit -- no, it has nothing to do with that.  The spirit with which it was offered was that the entire administration and certainly the Attorney General had to face a very difficult decision, a very difficult situation yesterday.  And that he thought that she had handled it well, as best as she could and --          Q  Well, does he think it was mishandled?\f          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- it was just speaking of warm words to a friend.          Q  Does he think the situation was mishandled?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President --          Q  In retrospect?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President stands  by the decisions of the law enforcement agencies, the decisions of the Attorney General.  He accepts full responsibility.  At the same time, I think that we all want to look to the future and figure out what exactly happened, do a full review, and make sure we do what we can to make sure this doesn't happen -- this kind of thing doesn't happen again, or at least we know how to handle it.          Q  How much did he know about what she was going to go ahead with?  I know that she made the case to him -- explained --outlined the case for action.  Did she say to him on Sunday precisely what action?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think it was specific operational detail as to what was going to happen.  I think that they had a general discussion about the action, about the advisability of action.  I think, as she noted, he asked a few general questions just trying to get a sense of how things were considered.  But it wasn't minute-by-minute detail of how the operation --          Q  Well, was it, "we are going in."  Is it, "we're going to use tear gas"?  I mean, what?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe it was that we want to go in and take some action that would increase the pressure on those in the compound, and hopefully spur them towards some sort of movement out.          Q  George, was there ever a conscious political decision made, or even a discussion about distancing the President from --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  I mean, we were in close contact with the Justice Department.  The President accepts responsibility for this.  At the same time -- I mean, we just wanted to be very, very clear about how this happened and be as factual as we could be on how the decisions were made.  It is the responsibility of those on the ground to make recommendations.  The Attorney General has operational control over this.  The President obviously accepts responsibility for all of this, and he stands by the Attorney General.          Q  George, there was a report on the television today -- and I don't know more than that -- one of the members of the cult had said going into a courthouse that the FBI had started the fire and not themselves.  There was also a picture yesterday on the TV of a smashing into the building  where the fire broke out.  And my question is, is the White House absolutely certain that this fire was --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  All the evidence we have is that this fire was started by David Koresh and those inside the compound -- every bit of evidence we have.          Q  Did the President ask the Attorney General why do this now, why this particular date, and did he ask about possible consequences of either death or injury?\f          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know the specific questions.  He had general questions about how the decision was going about being made.          Q  Those are general questions and did he ask generally, why now?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he asked, have you considered all of the consequences; have you considered the recommendations?  I don't know if he asked the question, "why now?  "  I don't know if he asked that specific question.          Q  Did she tell him why now in terms of the stuff that's come out since then about the information provided by the listening device about Koresh getting increasingly more violent?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I'm not certain how much specific detail they got into.  I know that she generally said that this is the recommendation she's prepared to make, I mean, the decision she's prepared to make.  It's based on the recommendations she was receiving from the field and after intensive questioning of those involved.  Again, I do not know how precisely detailed it was beyond that.          Q  What is the President's understanding why yesterday?  One of the people who went into the compound a couple weeks ago came out over the weekend with some speculation that he may have told law enforcement people something that precipitated this action.  Why yesterday?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  This is the first I've heard.  I think what we can go to is what the FBI and the Attorney General has said.  There were indications that those inside the compound were at some danger.  It was clear that the negotiations had broken down and it was the judgment of the experts involved in the negotiations that the situation was not going to get any better at all.            There was also some concern over the vulnerability of the agents themselves who had been working long beyond the time that these teams normally have to work.  And as the Attorney General has said, there was some concern over the fact that they did not have replacements in place who could stand in for them, and there was a concern over the safety.            All of these factors came into play.  They also considered the advice of a number of psychologists and other experts on David Koresh and those in the compound.  I would just go back to what the Attorney General has said.  You have to make the best judgment you can, given the information you have at the time.  They did.  Obviously, we all regret the loss of life.  It's a terribly unfortunate situation.  We all wish it could have turned out differently, but that doesn't take away from the judgments that were made at the time.          Q  George, when did the President know that they were going to use tear gas?  Was it before the assault on the compound?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't know.  I don't believe he was given a lot of detail on exactly how the operation would go.  I just don't know.          Q  Along that point, George, can you say whether the plan was presented to the President by the Attorney General as a way to end the standoff one way or the other yesterday?     \f     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was presented as a way to increase the pressure on those in the compound and, we all hoped, as a way to move some of those out and bring it in -- it wasn't presented as tomorrow is D-Day, this is it.          Q  Is the President satisfied that, A, he had all this relevant information necessary to make a decision, and B, that Janet Reno had all the relevant information necessary to make a decision?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I think he's satisfied that they were acting on the best advice and the best information they had, and he's not second-guessing it in any way whatsoever.          Q  George, was there a 12-hour gap between conversations between the President and the Attorney General?  In other words, they spoke at 11:00 a.m. and they didn't speak again until Clinton got back from dinner at --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's likely, yes.          Q  Did he call her?  What time did she call?  Was there a gap between when she called him?  I mean, was he at dinner when she called and --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no, no.  I think he called her last night.  I couldn't swear to it, but I believe he called her last night.  He just wanted to talk to her.          Q     what was going on?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of, no.          Q  What do you know about the situation now?  Everyone has perished who -- except eight or nine?  And do you know any of the other details?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know any more details than the FBI reported in Waco.          Q     watching CNN or how was he keeping track of what is going on?  If he wasn't talking to his Attorney General, how was he keeping track of what was going on here?  I mean, with all due respect to CNN, is that how he was doing it?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  There was also -- as I said, several people in the White House were in constant contact with their counterparts at Justice to have the full and complete information.          Q  Who were those contacts?  I mean, was it Mack McLarty, Webb Hubbell?  How was the President being kept informed?  That's not a --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe Mack was in contact with Webb.  I spoke with several people at the Justice Department.  I believe Bruce Lindsey spoke with people at the Justice Department.  Either Bernie or Vince was also in contact at different times during the day with people at the Justice Department.  We were fully briefed and fully informed.          Q  We were told this morning that the President may have spoken -- a chance that he may have spoken with Webb.  Do you know if that's true or not?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's a chance he may have.  I don't believe he did, but I think there's certainly a chance that he may have at some point.  I don't believe he did.  I think that the last contact he had during the day yesterday directly with \fthe Justice Department was the 11:00 a.m. phone call with the Attorney General.  But the White House was fully informed on a minute-to-minute basis of what was happening in Waco and what was happening at the Justice Department.          Q  George, who decided that the briefing would be done by the Attorney General?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Attorney General.          Q  Did you or did the White House communications staff -- were you ever involved with that decision?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  We were told about it.          Q  Did you ask her to go on Nightline and MacNeil-Lehrer and all that stuff?  Was that part of --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.          Q     there was no advice from the White House at all about her -- she was on all night, all day.  (Laughter.)          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, and she did a very good job.           Q  Why did you decide to have the President's reaction to the situation be only a written statement, which is traditionally the White House's way of distancing the President from the issue, not having him appear as personally saying anything?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, that wasn't the intent at all.  As I said, we had to -- we wanted to wait until we had all of the information at hand.  The President is also making a statement today.  The President made a statement yesterday morning.  The President has been fully involved --          Q  After this turned into less than a successful operation, the only statement from the President was what was on paper after the Attorney General had already given what amounted to the major facts in this.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was the first statement from the President, not the only statement from the President, number one.            Q  After the --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Number two -- well, the first.  Number two, the Attorney General --          Q  He gave a statement early in the morning when the thing was starting to move --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  And he gave one yesterday and he's giving one today.  Now, the second point --          Q  It just happens this was a written statement with no sort of communications policy or thought process involved?  It was the President wants to put out a written statement?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Knowing what we knew at the time, we thought it was appropriate for the President and he thought it was appropriate to put out a written statement expressing his regret and expressing his support for the Attorney General's --          Q  Why was it not appropriate for him to personally do something?\f          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, he did personally do so.  That is his statement.  It's a statement under his name.          Q  George, yesterday during the briefing you didn't say the President took full responsibility for what happened --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I certainly did.          Q  No, what you said was --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's just not right, Susan.          Q  Well, I think you can go back to the transcript, I mean, unless I miss something --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'd love to.          Q     Janet Reno said that she took full responsibility and you said that she made the decision, that the FBI --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And the President takes responsibility.  Absolutely.          Q  Took responsibility -- all right.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Check the transcript.          Q  Considering how little was known about what was going on inside the compound and, even now, how little is known, why is Washington calling this a mass suicide?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think that knowing what we know now and given all of the actions of David Koresh before and during, it is painfully clear that those there were under his control.          Q  It's stretching it a little bit where the kids are concerned, though, isn't it, George?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that that is an entirely different matter.  I mean, I think that David Koresh must bear responsibility for the deaths of those children, absolutely.  But he clearly was intent on creating some kind of an apocalyptic incident, and that's what he did.          Q  You're still operating completely on assumption, right?  I mean, you have no evidence, or you know of no evidence that this was mass suicide.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We have evidence that those inside the compound set fire to the compound, which led to the deaths of those inside.          Q  I didn't quite hear it.  This might be Ann's question, I didn't quite hear it.  But at what time did Clinton himself put out a statement on this?  I know Dee Dee said some stuff on this at 6:00 p.m., but the President put out --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  At 6:35 p.m., 6:40 p.m.          Q  Right after the evening news went on the air?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, right when we had all the information.  We were working on it.     \f     Q   Dee Dee confirmed this morning that the investigation the President is going to announce is going to be an administration-run investigation.  Why not have someone from the outside to make sure that it's not colored by those who would have a political stake, particularly those at the ATF whose actions have already been --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that clearly the ATF and the Justice Department will bear responsibility for the investigation.  That's not to rule out, as is often in investigations like this, having some sort of independent involvement as well.  But it will be run by the Treasury and Justice.           Q  Are you confident that you will not have any problem getting --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.          Q  George, did the President reach out to anybody else to get advice after the meeting with Janet Reno?  And who else in the White House sat in on that meeting?  Anyone else from Justice?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't believe anybody else was there at the time.  It was a phone call on Monday, it wasn't a meeting.          Q  Sunday.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sunday.  It was a phone call, it wasn't a meeting.  I believe he might have been there with Bruce, but beyond that, I think he just talked to the Attorney General.          Q  George, you said that in that phone call, she said that we want to go in and take action, as you said, that will force him out.  What did he think she was talking about?  If he didn't know about tear gas, what exactly was his idea of what he was approving?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he was approving an action to increase the pressure on --          q\bQ   It didn't matter how she did that?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  I mean --          Q  What information did he have in terms of how this would proceed?  Presumably he would have wanted to know, not minute-by-minute, but in a general sense --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he knew that this was the recommendation of those on the ground and the recommendation of the law enforcement agencies.  I just don't know --          Q  What is "this" -- when you say that "this" was the recommendation --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The action to increase pressure.  I don't know exactly what he was told -- whether he was going to be told that the tank was going to go up to the left wall and punch a hole in the window, or whether he was just told generally that they were moving forward in a way that would increase the pressure.  I just don't know.          Q  It's hard to imagine him not asking, though.          Q     that Janet Reno presented him with as her best advice about what they should go forward with, he would have agreed?     \f     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He was -- he did ask some general questions about the advice and recommendation he gave.  At the same time -- and I would repeat -- that this was based on the unanimous recommendation of the law enforcement agencies involved.          Q  George, it would seem that this question about just exactly in what detail the President was informed about the nature of the operation is going to come up again here and elsewhere.  Can you take that question and --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  Yes.          Q     get the answer and come back to us with all of it?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.          Q  Can you tell us that there was never a meeting -- a strategy session -- where you and others decided, we will put out a written statement from the President and we will have Janet Reno be on all of these television broadcasts?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Never.  Never.          Q  And you never called the Justice Department and said to anyone or Janet Reno, "you're the one who needs to be out front explaining this"?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not once.          Q  It just happened that way that she was the spokesman, that no one ever saw Bill Sessions until --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  She made a decision as Attorney General that it was important for her as the operational officer in charge, as the person who made the decision, to go out and take the questions on this tragic incident.          Q  She had no guidance from the White House at all?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We certainly didn't object.          Q  But did you -- (laughter) -- no, I'm sure you didn't object, but did you suggest it?  Was this a plan --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No. Absolutely not.          Q     a strategy?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.          Q  Did she clear it?            MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.          Q  Did she notify you?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We certainly knew about it.          Q  What happened to this great detailed process you have for clearing and talking to every public information officer and every -- under every rock and every place in government that something as major as this could have occurred without a discussion between you and the public information people at least at the Justice Department?     \f     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Attorney General made the decision and the Attorney General wanted to go forward.  It seemed like a good decision.  It was a good decision.  She did a good job.          Q  Let me ask it this way, George, if in hindsight how you would handle it?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was handled very well.          Q  You wouldn't change a thing if --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Change what?          Q  The way the White House handled any part of it -- from start to finish.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think that's an awful broad question and we're certainly going to have a review.  One of the reasons for the investigation is to look for ways in the future that something like this -- see what we can learn from an incident like this and see what we can learn about how to handle them.  If you're talking specifically about the issue of the press conferences, no, there -- wouldn't make any change at all.          Q  Two questions:  First of all, on her going on TV, no White House people or outside media consultants came up with this idea?  It's just very reminiscent of what you guys did during the campaign.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  How so?          Q  I'm thinking of like watching Clinton on Nightline after the draft story; watching Clinton on --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There's absolutely no comparison.  Yesterday there was a law enforcement incident.  The incident ended in tragic deaths of many, many people.  The Attorney General was involved in that decision.  The Attorney General made the decision to do that.  She felt it was her responsibility in the interest of public information to go out and take the questions of the press in order to make sure that all of the questions were answered, and she did a fantastic job.          Q  The second question is, did -- as someone who knows Clinton as well as you do, can you understand why it's sort of hard to believe that he might not have asked some detailed questions about what she intended to do?  In other words, she came and she said, I'm going to put pressure on them.  It's hard not to see Clinton, who's fairly intelligent and inquisitive, asking how.          Q  What kind?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Both the Attorney General said that he did ask questions, he did ask general questions.  I don't have a minute-by-minute account of the conversation.          Q  How long a conversation?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was about 15 minutes.          Q  Telephone conversation?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.          Q  George, was the federal cost of this standoff ever a consideration in terms of stepping up the pressure --     \f     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't believe so, no.          Q  George, you keep saying that the President takes full responsibility, but then you refer to it as her decision.  Does the President not accept the fact that as Commander-In-Chief, it is ultimately his decision?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know what this has to do with Commander-In-Chief.  This was a law enforcement action, not a military action.  And he clearly takes responsibility for the decisions of the law enforcement agencies involved taken in his government.  I mean, I think there's just no ambiguity about that.          Q  But is he accepting it as his decision as well as hers, or is he saying it's her decision?  There's a difference.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As a matter of fact, it was her decision.  He did not object to that decision.  He clearly takes full responsibility.           Q  George, this briefing has gone on just a little over 15 minutes, and as you can see a lot of things can be exchanged.  What exactly did they spend 15 minutes talking about if it was just very general?  That's a long period of time in a phone conversation.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It is an awful long phone conversation.  It was a very important phone conversation.  I think Brit has asked that we take the question, and I've said that I would.          Q  One of the things Reno said last night is that the buck stops here.  I think that was her direct quotation.  Does the President agree with that in this case?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President says he accepts full responsibility.  I think what the Attorney General was saying is that she made a decision, that she's going to accept all the responsibility that comes to her.  And she's not shrinking from that at all, but neither is the President.           Q  At any point in the conversation last night between the President and the Attorney General or this morning, did she ever offer her a resignation?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge.           Q  Even before the fire was out yesterday, there were some Republicans on Capitol Hill calling for an investigation.  Is the White House at all concerned about the timing of those requests trying to make political hay out of this situation?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  And I don't want to cast any questions about the motives of those who are requesting investigation.  We want an investigation, and we'll have a full and complete investigation.          Q  In what forum will you answer Brit's question?  Will you put out a written statement?  Will you -- the wires?  How will you answer the question that you've taken?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.          Q  George, can you remind us what the President was doing all yesterday afternoon, where he was, and what meetings he was involved in?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'll have to try and remember.  He had a series of meetings with different members of the staff during \fthe afternoon.  He was certainly monitoring the situation in Waco and getting periodic reports on that as well.  He did see some on CNN as well.  I believe he saw a fair amount of the FBI press briefing as well.          Q  And those reports would have come to him from Mack McLarty, would they -- do you think?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Mack talked to him, Bruce talked to him, I talked to him.          Q  George, to follow Helen's question, in their conversation this morning did they discuss at all her statement last night in response to the question about whether she would resign?  Did he say, I don't know why you felt the need to say that?  I'm here to reassure you that you don't have to do this?  Did that come up at all?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if it even came up that specifically.  I know that the bulk of the conversation was discussing where do we go from here and what form the investigation --          Q   The didn't talk at all about her kind of remarkable comment last night about --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I believe she was asked a question.          Q  And her response was, if the President wants me to, I will.          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Which would be, I think, the standard response that most Cabinet members would give.  I mean, it's a conditional statement.          Q     have a need to talk about whether -- personally about whether the President wanted her --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they talked about it.  I mean, what I learned about the conversation was that it was largely about the investigation itself.  And this just didn't come up.  I did not ask the question if they talked about --          Q  Will you take that with the Brit package?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Certainly.  (Laughter.)          Q  George, for the record, does the President want her to resign?  I know Dee Dee answered this morning --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely not.  He supports Janet Reno.  She's a good Attorney General.  She's done a good job.  She handled a difficult situation extremely well.          Q  George, does the President feel that he and Janet Reno were let down by the unanimous professional advice from the law enforcement experts on the ground?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  And the President is not second-guessing that decision and those recommendations in any way.  That is not to say that he doesn't regret the loss of life.  Everybody regrets the loss of life in this situation.  But the best judgments were made in a difficult situation based on the best information we had.     \f     Q  George, the 15-minute conversation was the one on Sunday, is that correct?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.          Q  How long was the one at 11:00 a.m. yesterday morning?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  I'll take that question, too.          Q  Were these outside experts that they were consulting with, or experts within the ATF and the FBI?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You'd have to ask them.  I'm just not sure.  I know that there were several experts.          Q  And also, why weren't there replacements for these people?  Is the unit that small?            MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I think it is a very small highly-specialized unit.  But I think it's one of the kinds of things that the investigation will examine.          Q  George, isn't there a factor here involving the FBI Director?  Normally, a president, when he wants to get information, doesn't only asks the Attorney General.  I know the chain of command.  But presidents talk to their FBI directors.  In this case, throughout this entire siege, he has not felt that he could pick up the phone and talk to Bill Sessions, who is from Waco, and get expertise from him on what to do and what not to do?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he talked to the FBI Director well in the beginning of the situation when it first broke out in Waco.  At the same time, the Attorney General bears the ultimate responsibility and he was getting fully briefed from the Attorney General.          Q  Don't you think the ambiguous situation that Director Sessions is in has some impact on the way the President is briefed and on the way that all of this evolved?          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  I mean, it's perfectly appropriate that he be briefed by the Attorney General and that the Attorney General has supervisory authority over the FBI Director, and that's following the chain of command.          THE PRESS:  Thank you .                                 END                    1:03 P.M. EDT     #60-04/20

Where have we heard that before???No, Bill, my full original post included sufficient disclaimers so thatyou could see that I was not claiming that it was a perfect world fromthe Branch Davidians point of view. The point of my article was that itis inappropriate to compare Massada and the fate of the Jewish rebelsto Waco. The Zealot men faced certain execution in a way that wasanathema to their religion, and they knew that their wives and childrenwould be enslaved. American prisons may not be garden spots, but theydon't compare to what the survivors of Massada might have faced. Youindicate that you agree that the Branch Davidians faced a trial. Howdoes that fact alone make for a comparison here?  Even if thegovernment had wanted to find "fall guys" for the BATF deaths, theystill had to prove it to a jury.Once again, my point was quite simple--any comparison between thesituation of the Branch Davidians and the Jews of Massada is absurd.-- ________________________________________Jack F.

In my opinion, orientation has nothing to do with it.I don't understand what you are getting at here.  If the chances of promiscuity are larger, yet the rate of promiscuity is lower in the heterosexualcommunity, doesn't that imply that the homo/bi sexual population is then even more promiscuous than the raw statistics imply?

Sadly, we don't (as a society) look uponhomosexuality as normal (and as we are all too well aware, there are alotof people who condemn it).  As a result, the gay population is not encouragedto develop "non-promiscuous" relationships.  In fact there are many roadblocksput in the way of such committed relationships.  It is as if the heterosexualcommunity puts these blocks there so as to perpetuate the claim that gays are immoral.  "My, if we allowed gays to marry, raise children ... we mightjust find out they're as moral as we are, can't have that can we?" Just some thoughts.  Flame away. :)Dan

If theyare arrested they call their lawyer, post bail and hope for a pleabargain.  If they pull a gun and shoot a cop during a raid they willbe charged with first degree murder if they survive the raid.  Drugdealers have guns for protection from their customers and othercriminals, not to shoot cops.  Cops are shot on no-knock drug raidsbecause the criminals aren't aware that they are cops.No-knock raids on homes occupied by non-criminals are more likely toend in disaster.  Mom and Pop citizen _KNOW_ that they have notcommitted any crime, they KNOW that anyone breaking into their housecannot be a cop because they have done nothing wrong.  If they havethe means to defend themselves they may because they KNOW that thehousebreakers are criminals not cops.  Cops and homeowners may die.The first reports from Waco stated that the ATF had a warrant tosearch for illegal weapons and also an arrest warrant if the illegalweapons were found.  In this case the no-knock warrant was not calledfor.  It is difficult to flush a gun down the toilet.  The ATF couldhave surrounded the compound.  A marked police car could have drivenup to the entrance and uniformed officers could have knocked andserved the warrant usual way.  It this had happened and and Koreshrefused the warrant or drove the cops off at gun point then most ofthe t.p.g folks would have kept quiet.--Rod Anderson  N0NZO         | "I do not think the United States governmentBoulder, CO                 | is responsible for the fact that a bunch ofrcanders@nyx.cs.du.edu      | fanatics decided to kill themselves"satellite  N0NZO on ao-16   |        Slick Willie the Compassionate

EDT     THE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon.  Ladies and gentlemen, two months ago I presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our national deficit and to increase our investment in the American people, their jobs and their economic future.  The federal budget plan passed Congress in record time, and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in the country.            Then, the short-term jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed the House of Representatives two weeks ago.  It now has the support of a majority of the United States Senate.           All of these members of Congress know it's time to get the economy moving again, to get job growth going again, to get a fast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity.  Unfortunately, a minority of the members of the United States Senate have used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working the will of the majority on the jobs bill.          When Congress returns, I ask every senator from every state and from both parties to remember what is at stake.  The issue is not politics, it's people.  Sixteen million of them are looking for full-time jobs and can't find them.  These men and women don't care about who's up or down in Washington.  They care about paying the rent and meeting the mortgage payment, about putting food on the table and buying shoes for their children, about regaining a sense of dignity that comes from doing a day's work and supporting their families and drawing a paycheck.          They're asking those of us who have the privilege of serving to put aside politics and do something now to move our economy forward.  I am prepared to do that.  And I have been working with the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some of the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs plan.  I'm willing to compromise, so long as we keep the focus on jobs, keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet national needs.            Our opponents have been asking for a smaller package.  Today I ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what size package Congress can approve that actually meets the needs of the American people.           But even as we make those reductions and the package will be smaller, I believe we must address problems that are on the minds of millions of Americans, and one in particular, and that is the need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the dramatic rise in violent crime.           So I will ask, even in this reduced package, for an additional $200 million in federal funding to help local communities to rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the fiscal problems caused by the national recession.  Together, with a matching effort by local governments, this could put as many as 10,000 police officers back on the job, and back on the beat in communities all across our nation.          At a time when too many of our people live in fear of violent crime, when too many businesses have closed and too many people have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their homes, rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments America can make.  And I ask both Houses of Congress to make that investment in our people's safety and in their piece of mind.            I believe in the need for strong federal action to keep the economy going toward recovery and to create jobs.  Make no mistake about it:  I will fight for these priorities as hard as I ever have.  I will never forget that the people sent me here to fight for their jobs, their future and for fundamental change.          I want to thank the police officers who are here today and tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here that I had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to rehire police officers.  They came here because they believe in the summer jobs portion of the package.  And I want them to be free to talk about that.  They came here not out of any law enforcement concern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country to have a chance to have jobs this summer, to have safer streets and a brighter and more peaceful future.          I say what I say today not just because it's good for law enforcement but because it's good for the people who live in these communities.  I have always supported community policing not only because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate, but because it cements better relationships between people in law enforcement and the people that they're hired to protect.  It reduces the chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the chances of harmony and safe streets at the same time.          These are the kinds of things that we are trying to do.  I promised in my campaign that I'd do everything I could to put another 100,000 police officers on the street over the next four years.  This makes a good downpayment on that.  This keeps in mind the core of the jobs package.  And this will help us to move forward.            So I ask the people in the Senate who have blocked the jobs bill, let's work together.  I can accept a reduced package if you will increase your commitment to safe streets.  I do not accept the fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to building our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will create real and lasting  prosperity for our people.  I have done my part now to end the gridlock; I ask you to do yours.            I want now to give the people who are here with me on the platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the American people -- beginning with Janet Reno, the distinguished Attorney General.            *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *           Q  Mr. President, can you tell us -- do you think that the jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over the suggestion of a VAT tax at this point in the congressional dialogue?          THE PRESIDENT:  Not at all.  I think it should have --they wouldn't have any relationship one to the other.  First of all, I made absolutely no decision on that.  You should know that there's a lot of support in the business community and the labor community -- people have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden of the present system on many of our major employers, particularly many of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the strength of this economy.  But I have made absolutely no decision that would even approach that on that or any other kind of general tax.          Q  Do you personally believe that the American public is ready to pay for -- to have another tax to pay for health care?  I mean, apart from what business and labor leaders have said --          THE PRESIDENT:  I'm not going to speculate on that.  I will say this:  The real issue is how quickly we can recycle the benefits of all the savings to cover the cost.  I mean, that is --everyone knows that if you do what we're proposing to do, if you streamline the insurance system, if you fix the system so that there's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over-utilize or over-provide certain services, if you provide primary and preventive care in places where it isn't now, every single analysis shows absolutely massive savings to the health care system.          The real question is whether you can transfer those savings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have virtually no coverage so that you provide people the security.  I have no idea.  The polls say that, but I don't know.  All I know is the polls that I see in the press that many of you have commissioned, they say overwhelmingly the American people want the security of an affordable health care system.          But I don't think that has anything to do with this stimulus, and it certainly shouldn't have.  People want a job first and foremost.  They want that more than anything else.          Q  Now that you've announced your willingness to compromise on the stimulus package, can you tell us what parts of your package you consider vital and uncompromisable?  I assume summer jobs is one.          THE PRESIDENT:  I want the summer jobs; I want the highway program and I want the police program.  I still intend -- let me say this:  I still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime bill, which did not pass the Congress last year.  This is a supplement to that, not a substitute for it in any way.  But I think we need to do that.          I think we need the Ryan White funds because of the enormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately and disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people with AIDS.  And there are several other things that I think should be done.  We have to do the Agriculture Department meat inspectors; the safety of the public depends on that.            There are a number of other things that I don't -- I don't think any of it should be cut, but I have given Senator Mitchell and Senator Byrd -- I talked to them.  And Senator Dole called me yesterday to discuss this, and I told him that I would call him back.  I called him back last night in New Hampshire and we discussed this.  And I basically asked them to talk today, and said that I would not make any statements about any specifics until at least they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could reach some accord.            So I don't want to be any more specific than I have been already, and let's see if they can talk it out.          Q  When you talked to Senator Dole and Senator Mitchell did you tell them about your -- increase also, that $200 million, that you want that as part of the package?          THE PRESIDENT:  I did -- I told Senator -- I left word for Senator Mitchell last night about it.  When I talked to Senator Dole -- I don't remember for sure -- I do not believe I mentioned it.  But I did tell him that I was prepared to reduce the package and I wanted to break the gridlock, and I told him that I was working on a reformulation of it so that -- in the hope that it would become even more focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that I thought the American people wanted us to address.  And this is certainly consistent with that.          Thank you.                                 END3:12 P.M. EDT

I have been following this businesssince it started 52 days ago.  The Branch Davidians have occupied the Mt.Carmel location for some years, and their neighbors (you know, the peoplenext door) have said to a man, that the BD folks were quiet and neverbothered anybody.There were some defector from the BD who alleged child abuse within themovement, but how does this bring in the Feds? In particular what interestwould ATF have in child abuse. O.K. It was the allegation of possesingillegal automatic weapons.  A search warrant could have been obtained(properly) only on probable cause. This means that some evidence that anillegal auto weapon was shipped in, or an illegal kit for convertingsemi-auto weapons to full automatic was purchased or shipped.In either case, how does this require an NO-KNOCK warrent, with a bunch ofmacho hot dog assholes busting into the place *without* identifyingthemselves. Milleniests tend to be a bit paranoid anyway. It is nosurprise they shot when invaded. Hell I am not a religious extremist and Imight have done the same myself. If the DEA busted into my house bymistake without identifying themselve and I had a gun in my hand, I wouldshoot first and wonder later.So if it was illegal guns, the ATF should have gotten a normal warrant(how can you flush a 50 calibre machine gun down the toilet?) andpresented it in a peaceful normal way. David Koresh has had brushes withthe law, even standing trial for attempted murder in which he wasacquitted. In every prior brush with the law, Koresh and his people actedpeacibly. There was no prior action on the part of the BD folks toindicate that they were any danger to society.NOTE: The question of whether the BD people were religious extremists orslight daft is totally irrelevant. It is *not* against the law to belooney or zany.Look and learn folks. And be VERY afraid.Conan the Libertarian-- "If you can't love the Constitution, then at least hate the Government"

Perhaps thats not the way to handleit. It is a completely different thing to start asserting as manyhave done that the government is primarily to blame. The comparisonswith the NAZIs in particular are purely gratuitous.Since you have provided a constructive opinion on the issue yourpost desreves to be taken seriously. Peter Nelson also made somevery good points about how a low key approach might have been more effective.The point is though that you learn through mistakes. The govtplayed the wrong card and lost. Thats not a big deal. Theyhad had four guys murdered at the begining and maybee they just were not prepared for wuite this situation. Who could be?If the same thing were to happen all over again we might perhapsbe able to castigate the Govt if they used the same tactics and failedin the same way. As it is I can't say that I would not have made thesame mistake. Maybee I wouldn't because I don't as a rule go infor a confrontational situation if I can avoid it. Maybee I wouldbecause with all those press about its very difficult not to trythe macho stuff.The FBI had information from within the compound we had no accessto. They may have calculated that the B-D followers resolve wascracking based on their listening devices within the compound. Theyknew that Koresh had chickened out of one suicide attempt. Thismay have been the reason why they considered that fear might have been a weapon for breaking his resolve. Again in Panama they had usedthe heavy rock music to great effect during Bush's invasion. Funny thatfew of the Koresh supporters and appologists complain much about thedeath of several thousand Pananmanian civilians while the US govt attemptedto arrest their former ally.|>And please let's not turn this into a pro-gun vs. anti-gun|>discussion.

Thus the assault on them was completelyinexcusable no matter what rationalisation people might wish toemploy.Of course we have to consider the guns issue. That is the wholecore of the question. Everything else is a diversion.Phill Hallam-Baker

Also, I have heard that one of the cultmembers who earlier said that he and another individual started the fireis no longer claiming that he did it.  Moreover, he and possibly theother person may not have even really said that they did it in thefirst place---we only have the FBI's WORD ON THIS.  I'll believe it whenI hear from a cult member's own mouth and not before then.The FBI claims that they saw two cult members starting the fire.  Theyclaimed that the two were clad in black clothing and were wearing gasmasks.  Hmmm...  Sounds like they might have been describing an ATFagent to me.  Weren't the cigarette cops wearing black?  Note:  thisis just speculation on my part.  Still, it is something to think about.Here's something else to ponder upon:  the two agents that were plantedin the compound might have done something to start that fire.  I don'tknow if they did it deliberately or not---if they did at all---but Iwould like to see statements from these two agents on the events thattranspired during that day.  I think that they would be ratherenlightening don't you think?  They were inside the compound so theyought to have a real good idea of what went on in there.  Of course ifthey did help burn down the house then I doubt that they would bevery forthcoming with any information.The FBI also mentioned that fire errupted in multiple locations in thecompound.  They *may* have said this so that people might be morelikely to be convinced that the BDs started the fire.  However,consider that if the FBI did light-up that house would they admit toit?  I think not.  Imagine the public outrage that would ensue ifpeople discovered that the FBI killed 86 people.  Obviously, the FBIwould do its best to suppress the truth and make people think the BDsstarted the fire.  Fire can spread in unusual ways in a wood house---fires burning in more than one location in a house isn't inconsistentwith a house fire.  The tear gas cannisters---which do produce heatdespite what you may have been told by the media---may have contributedto starting the blaze.  Also, it was very windy on the day of thefire.  Flames and burning debri might have floated over to parts ofthe house that weren't already on fire.  Like I said the verdict isn'tin yet.  The FBI may very well be guilty of a holocaust.> -- > John Mechalas                                          "I'm not an actor, but> mechalas@gn.ecn.purdue.edu                                 I play one on TV."> Aero Engineering, Purdue University                     #include disclaimer.hScott Kennedy,  Brewer and PatriotBefore:  "David Koresh is a cheap thug who interprets          the Bible through the barrel of a gun..."  --ATF spokesmanAfter:   "[The ATF] is a cheap thug who interprets          [the Constitution] through the barrel of a gun..."  --Me

[later on in the article after it talks about the claim of 1,205           Americans in North Vietnamese prisons]"Phong said the easiest way to prove that the document is a     fabrication is to review Quang's career. In 1972, he said, Quang was     not deputy chief of staff; he was the army commander in Military Region 4    in central Vietnam."2) I heard on the radio that the Church of Scientology has filed for    bankrupcy becuase the employees of Cocolat , owned by CoS, filed a    class action suit against them for requiring the employees to pay dues   to become members of the Church. Anyone heard more about this?3) Micheal Jackson went into business with Micheal Milken.

My rasberry award goes to Dave Palmerwho makes the following benediction after spewing out the facts,"Score another one for the forces of ignorance and superstition"as if the public deaths of over 80 people were not a clear and definite warning as to what happens to people who follow false prophets.From where I set, looks like Satan has a three-bagger going.In article <1993Apr20.051902.9472@gw.wmich.edu> x86carnell@gw.wmich.edu writes:>In article <C5rLps.Fr5@world.std.com>, jhallen@world.std.com (Joseph H Allen) writes:>> In article <1qvk8sINN9vo@clem.handheld.com> jmd@cube.handheld.com (Jim De Arras) writes:>>>I'm short of patience tonite, but rabid dogs deserve and get better treatment  >>>than the BDs got.>> >> Although I'm an atheist, the events in Waco have really sickened me.

One can argue aboutthe initial raid, but it would be worth mentioning, before the facts getlost, that1. The Branch Davidians were tipped off that the BATF was comingduring the initial raid.2. The Branch Davidians opened fire first.It is also worth noting that the Branch Davidians, according tothe FBI's statements, opened fire immediately when the FBI issued the warningover the phone, and that the vehicle which launched the tear gas grenadesdid so under fire from the compound.>>> >> The killing of the four BATF agents was surey a dispicable act, but that was>> an escalation of the confrontation which the BATF started.  War is bad>>Even this seemingly obvious issue is far from settled.

This would have workedwith minimal casualties (The Branch Davidians apparently did not have gasmasks) if Koresh had not had a very different reaction in mind.>>>> precisely because of humanity's tendancy for escalation.

(likely ?).They both indicated that they had no idea that a Masada-like mass suicidecould result from the introduction of non-lethal agents into the compound.Some of these issues are highly technical - the impression I haveis that the "Ranch Apocalypse" represented a Rubrik's cube for thecounterterrorist types. The Branch Davidians were too well armed for for a simple assault (the BATF found this out the hard way). The complexwas probably to big for the kind of "surgical" Delta Force coup de mainthat the Bundesgrenschutz did in the 1970s when one of their airlinerswas highjacked by "Black September". The reason this seige had gone onas long as it had was that the government really didn't have any good options,and to wait it out was the safest and most logical choice.>>Similarly, why the raid yesterday?

Koresh had made some statements building that idea up, and Easter came and went with nothing happening. It may be that the authoritiesfelt emboldened to move for this reason. IT IS just a theory.>>Why yesterday?  Because this was turning into a huge embarassment for>the Clinton administration.I don't believe this is a valid argument.

This matter ties in with the infamous "social scientists are notreally scientists" brouhaha on sci.skeptic. Here is a case where, ifone believes the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI, thepredictions of psychological experts were proven false, not underlaboratory conditions, but in the cauldron of practical application.2. Koresh's actions (or the actions of whoever started the fire - we're not likely to know what went on in there) contrast so violentlywith the example of Christ that I'm sure many Christians find itdifficult to understand why or how this happened. Under such conditions, the search for scapegoats is only too natural a humanreaction, even though that is not a particularly Christian responseeither.3. Koresh's mother apparently had some false hopes that the cult members had sought refuge in a bunker somewhere in the complex. Her grief must be monumental at this time, and the search for a way toescape moral responsibility for her family's destruction is likewisereal. We may not have seen the end to the self depravation.4. The fact, simply stated, is that a good number of innocent childrenand not-so-innocent adults died horribly for no good reason. It isexceptionally hard for us, as human beings, to accept this fact.We can hope for some ultimate salvation, some panacea to make itbetter, but even though hope is a wonderful thing, that doesn'tmake it so. There is no meaning to this thing. It just is.Bill R.--"When up a dangerous faction starts,         "My opinions do not representWith wrath and vengeance in their hearts;     those of my employer orBy solemn League and Cov'nant bound,          any government agency."To ruin, slaughter, and confound;             - Bill Riggs (1993)To turn religion to a fable,And turn the Government to a Babel;Pervert the law, disgrace the gown,Corrupt the senate, rob the crown;To sacrifice old England's glory,And make her infamous in story.When such a tempest shook the land,How could unguarded virtue stand ?"- Jonathan Swift (1732)

The police strategy of bursting in with weapons drawn, clearly marked asofficers and yelling "Police" repeatedly.  This is used every day to bust drughouses.  The idea is to awe the suspects into submission with surprise anddisplay of firepowere in order to avoid a gun fight.  As for not knocking, it'sa sad necessity in many cases since the suspects will attempt to escape or evenfight.  Usually this strategy works; if it didn't, then it wouldn't be used socommonly, now would it?Whether or not it was appropriate to use this strategy on the BD is not mypoint, since I don't think any of us have enough information to make a clearjudgement on this issue.I merely point out that it IS a valid strategy which is used every day.Furthermore, we don't know of any substitute strategy capable of apprehendingpotentially dangerous and armed suspects.  Do you suggest that the policealways knock with guns holstered and never arrest any suspects until they havebeen allowed to inspect the officers's badges?  Just what should the police dowhen apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects?  How far can theyreasonably go to identiy themselves?  What do you suggest they can do whichcan't be faked by the "competition"?Even if you've got deadly enemies who may pretend to be cops, that's not anexcuse to murder police.  In the case of the BD's, there was almost definitelyat most the paranoid delusion of deadly enimies who would pretend to be cops.-- *Isaac Kuo (isaackuo@math.berkeley.edu)*       ___** _____/_o_\\_____*Twinkle, twinkle, little .sig,*(==(/_______\\)==)*Keep it less than 5 lines big.* \\==\\/     \\/==/

In practice,communism has "solved" the problem by killing off anybody who is _too_productive, and who therefore raises embarrassing questions about why therest of the group is a bunch of sluggards.  The mass butchery of "kulaks"in the USSR is a good instance of this.    A poor second best is to have a neighboring capitalist country to whichpeople of politically incorrect skill and ambition flee.  I often wonderjust what Castro would have done if the Cubans presently in Miami wouldhave been forced to remain in Cuba.  Would they have revolted and killedhim off, or been killed?    Best of all is to build a wall locking the citizens of your country in,load it up so heavily with attack dogs, barbed wire, and land mines thatmost people fleeing over it die, and then give everyone the choice ofobedience, prison, or flight.  This would be a bad science-fiction novel,if the East Germans hadn't actually done it.  The last person to diecrossing the wall, as I recall, was an unarmed woman who was shot in theback.  Erich Honecker was going to go on trial for that, but he fled tosocialists in Chile.    It's good to be kind to one's intellectual opponents, but sometimesit's a sheer waste of time.--Erich Schwarz / schwarze@starbase1.caltech.edu
