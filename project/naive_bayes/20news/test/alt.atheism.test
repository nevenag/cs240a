Liberty is never free, it is always purchased at some cost, almost always at the cost to another.  Whos liberty is more inalienable?Similarly for right of life.  When one person must die if he is to saveanother, or even a group of others, whos life is more inalienable?  That leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty, especially for serial killers.  Whos life and liberty is more valuable,the serial killer, or the victim?  According to that beautiful line,those two rights should be completely inviolate, that is, noone should beable to remove them.  This _includes_ government.  Admittedly the serialkiller has restricted some people's life and/or liberty, but is not hisown life/liberty inviolate also?

In turn my father has helpedwith people buying houses to minimise the amount of intrest they pay and in some cases buy houses intrest free with the help of those morefortunate in the community.

Could it be that they believed an Islamically owned and operated bank couldn't possibly cheat them? So please don't try to con us into thinking that it will all work out right next time.jon.

Thus while I believe that no gods exist, this does                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> not imply *faith* on my part that it is so.  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Let me first say that "to believe that no gods exist" is in fact different than "not believing in a god or gods". I will argue that your latter statement, "I believe that no gods exist"does rest upon faith - that is, if you are making a POSITIVE statement that "no gods exist" (strong atheism) rather than merely saying I don't  know and therefore don't believe in them and don't NOT believe in then(weak atheism). Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying  I BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even after reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.But first let me say the following.We might have a language problem here - in regards to "faith" and"existence". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist.To exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVEbeing - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does notexist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it's rather pointlessto debate the so called "existence" of God - and that is not whatI'm doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground ofbeing. When you say that "god does not exist", I also accept thisstatement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However,in what follows I will use the phrase "the existence of God" in it's'usual sense' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it.I would like a clarification upon what you mean by "the existence ofGod". We also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is whatWebster says:faith 1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTYb  (1): fidelity to one's promises   (2): sincerity of intentions2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God   (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religionb  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   (2): complete trust3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^of religious beliefssyn see BELIEFOne can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you saythat you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion"based upon observation", I will have to ask "what observtions areyou refering to?" There are NO observations - pro or con - thatare valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observationscan only point you in a direction - a direction that we might evenbe predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes partents "believe in God" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusionabout the "existence" or "non-existence" of God requires a leap - andyou have made this leap when you actively say "I believe that God  does/does not exist". Personally, I think that both statements aremisguided. Arguing over the "existence" of God is precisely the wrong wayto find Him (and yes, I use "Him" because a personal God is the only viable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use "She" go ahead. Of course God is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to anthropomorphise. If you want me to explain myself further I'll be glad to.) And please, if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently disagree - it's in no ones advantage to start name calling. If a person thinks I've misunderstood something in the FAQs, or if they they think I have not read them well enough, just point out to me the error of my ways and I correct the situation. I'm interested in a polite and well  thought out discussion.> Cheers> > Simon> -- > Simon Clippingdale                simon@dcs.warwick.ac.uk> Department of Computer Science    Tel (+44) 203 523296> University of Warwick             FAX (+44) 203 525714> Coventry CV4 7AL, U.K.--bob singletonbobs@thnext.mit.edu

This may not, on the surface, sound like a bad thing, but whodefines what a potential criminal is?

Indeed, allowthem freely to give advice on anything and they will fritter away one'swealth and disobey the wishes of the owner of this wealth.  We see them without religion, when, alone, they are left to their owndevices; they are lacking in both pity and virtue when their carnaldesires are at stake. It is easy to enjoy them, but they cause greatanxiety. The most virtious among them are libertines. But the mostcorrupt are whores. Only those of them whom age has deprived of anycharm are untainted by vice. They have three qualities particular tomiscreants; they complain of being oppressed, whereas it is theywho oppress; they make oaths, whereas they are lying; they pretendto refuse men's solicitations, whereas they desire them most ardently.Let us beg the help of God to emerge victorious from their evil deeds.And preserve us in any case from their good ones."(Quote from Mas'ud al-Qanawi, ref. A. Bouhdiba, Sexuality in Islam, p. 118).I wouldn't consider this quote as being exemplary of the Islamic (TM)viewpoint though.  For all we know, the prophet's cousin andthe Fourth Khalif Hazret-i Ali may have said this after a frustrating night with a woman.Selim Guncer--Selim E.

See the difference?Just for the record ( not that any kind of information would belikely to affect your thinking ) I have an MSEE -- focus inElectromagnetics -- from Penn.A photo of the smallest logo in the world does not an atom make.What was observed is something we can measure that matches what the mathematical model we call an atom had predicted.  Much in the same way that we need BOTH a particle model and awave model for light, the atomic model is a mathematicalrepresentation of physical phenomena.  A model that can andprobably will continue to change over time.  That makes it subjective (the model that is).  However, the model gives us anobjective way to talk about the physical world.To put it another way, the Quantum Mechanical model of the atomallows for discussion of the atom that will give repeatable andunambiguous results, which is objective.  However, as Bohr andEinstein duked it out mid-century, the interpretation ofthose reapeatable, observable measurements is quite subjective.Bohr said that the observable randomness of atomic motion wasinherent in the nature of the universe.  Einstein said particlemotion was deterministic, but it was our measurement shortcomingsthat introduced the randomness.  They were talking about theEXACT same results, though.-jim halat

Do you mean by "omnipotent"that God should be able to do anything/everything?  This createsa self-contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectivelyuseless.To be descriptive, omnipotence must mean "being all-powerful" andnot "being able to do anything/everything".Let me illustrate by analogy.Suppose the United States were the only nuclear power on earth.  Supposefurther that the US military could not effectively be countered by anynation or group of nations.  The US has the power to go into any countryat any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of theUS see fit.  The US would be militarily "omnipotent".But suppose further that the US holds to a doctrine/philosophy of notinterfering in the internal affairs of any nation, such as the currentcivil war in the former Yugoslavian states.Technically (in this scenario) the US would have the power to unilaterally go into Yugoslavia and straighten out the mess.  Buteffectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy of non-interference.  If the policy of non-interference were held tostrongly enough, then there would never be a question that it wouldever be violated.  Effectively, the US would be limited in what itcould actually do, although it had the power to do "whatever it wanted".The US would simply "never want to interfere" for such an idea wouldbe beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolatenon-interference policy.God is effectively limited in the same sense.  He is all powerful, butHe cannot use His power in a way that would violate the essence of whatHe, Himself is.I hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerningomnipotence.Regards,Jim B.

If so, I will be glad to repost them.  Will you accept that it just may be a practice among some Muslims, if I do?  Or will you continue to claimthat we are all lying and that it is "not practised at all amongst Muslims".I don't think F. Karner has to tell everyone anything.  Least of all thathe is lying.Since you obviously know nothing about this practice, there is very littleyou can contribute to the discussion except to accuse everyone of lying.Perhaps it is your ignorance which is showing.  Learn more about Islam.Learn more about Muslims.  Open your eyes.  Maybe you will also see someof the things the atheists see.

Whereas I_logically_ can only support the weak atheist position, in effect I ama strong atheist (and wish I could be a mathematical one).  Tojustify my strong atheist position I believe I need only show thatthe evidence presented in favour of any of the gods under scrutinyis faulty.If I read the FAQ correctly, no argument for the existence of god(generic, as represented by mainstream theologians) has ever beenfound to be unassailable.  To me this is adequate evidence that the_real_god_ is undefinable (or at least no definition has yet beenfound to be watertight), which in turn I accept as sufficient tobase a disbelief in each and every conceivable god.I'm a little fuzzy on the edges, though, so opinions are welcome(but perhaps we should change the thread subject).-- Lucio de Re (lucio@proxima.Alt.ZA) - tab stops at four.

That, after all, is the meaning of compromise.Plus some problems: If the relativists have no values in common, compromise is impossible - what happens then?    Who, if anyone, is right?  What happens if one relativist has a value "Never compromise?".  A value "plant bombs in crowded shopping areas"?

I think of it as "Don't worry, be happy". For many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to anepistemological consideration:  what do we accept as a reliable way ofknowing?  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existenceof gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Mostphilosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one thatmust be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logicalbasis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing? There is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absenceof any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elsesword "on faith", we just mean that having found this person to bereliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now.If we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidenceeverywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge aboutgods? The difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally thenone of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing,rather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faithis in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptablebasis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable atother times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheistbelieves that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliableknowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position thantheism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all otherknowledge.  Without evidence, why should we believe in gods rather thanSanta Claus or the Easter Bunny? I would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn'trequire absolute knowledge of the lack of gods.  I don't believe thatthere is any such thing as absolute knowledge.  Atheism is the best andsimplest theory to fit the (lack of) facts and so should be held untilcontrary evidence is found. David Nye (nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu).

For a start there are enoughcurrent versions of the Bible to make comparisons to show that what you writeabove is utter garbage. Witness JW, Mormon, Catholic, Anglican, and GreekOrthodox Bibles. But to really convince you I'd have to take you to a goodold library. In our local library we had a 1804 King James which I comparedto a brand new, hot of God's tongue Good News Bible. Genesis was almostunrecognisable, many of the discrepencies between the four gospels had beenedited from the Good News Bible. In fact the God of Good News was a muchmore congenial fellow I must say. If you like I'll get the 1804 King James out again and actually give yousome quotes. At least the headings haven't changed much.Jeff.

Rob, I am not intimate with Jewish theology, but I understandthat you are a Messianic Jew. Correct me if I am wrong, butit appears that the views of Messianic Jews on metaphysicsis different to that of the majority of Jews. While Jewishtheology overall is quite distinct from the Christianic godviews, I have heard that it is possible for Jews to attributeevil to their god, an no-no for Christians, the Bible isstill seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man.

Either there is some connectionbetween the text, the fact that it exists, and your interpretation ofit, or it is purely arbitrary.. Further, the question is why is hasone to carry the burden of Biblical texts when one could simply writeother books that convey the message better. You might answer that onecan't becuase  some peculiar Biblical information might be lost, butthat holds true of every other book, and the question remains why hasthe Bible still a special place? Can't it be replaced somehow? Is itok to bargain the dangerous content of the Bible against some othermessage that is included as well?  (Deletion)>|> Do you see the danger in doing so?

(Deletion)>If we>read two stories about the importance of helping the poor,>and in one God is a spirit, and in the other God has a body,>which is more important, helping the poor, or resolving>the contradiction about the corporeal nature of God?> If we read two stories in the Bible, one that god commands peopleto kill children for being idolaters and another where god killschildren directly, what is more important to resolve, the message thatchildren are to be killed or if it has  to be done by god?  And the argument you have given is a fallacy, while it may not be importantin the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not, itcan be crucial in other questions. Religious believers resolve contradictionswith that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way,and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to somegod. One cannot resolve questions by the statement do what is good when whatis good depends on the question.   Benedikt

In many types ofexperiments the "prediction" is that the observed phenomena will happen againand be capable of being observed. For example, in chemistry someone may predictthe outcome of a chemical reaction and then actually observe that reaction repeatedly. You can't repeat or ever know for sure the original conditions thatproduced life. So it seems we could never say, "That's exactly how it happened."As far as we know that event was unobserved.

As I mentioned in the Tradition# cited above, for example, it was sufficient in the absence of a theory# about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the "evil"# which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as "satanic."

But what else can you do?     This is why I asked the above.  How would you then     know God exists as a spirit or being rather than     just being metaphorical?  I mean, it's okay to say     "well, Satan is just metaphorical," but then you     have to justify this belief AND justify that God is     not some metaphor for something else.     I say this because there are many, many instances of     Satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in      the Old Testament book of Job, or the temptor in the     New Testament Gospels).  In the same way, God too is     described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know     one is metaphorical and not the other.     Further, belief in God isn't a bar to evil.  Let's     consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were     metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe     in God to justify this belief.  Again, we have a      case where someone does believe in God, but by     religious standards, they are "evil."

If you're prepared to say "Let's round these people up andstick them in a concentration camp without trial", it's only a short step togassing them without trial.  After all, it seems that the Nazis originallyonly intended to imprison the Jews; the Final Solution was dreamt up partlybecause they couldn't afford to run the camps because of the devastationcaused by Goering's Total War.

Letterman:  "Are youlike me?  Do you like science and medicine?").Difference is that science is based on consensus.  The points above arewell made,  and obviously there is some discussion as to what thefacts are in some cases.  But if you are willing to play along withthe definitions,  you too can hit the jackpot.  Science also tends touse the principle of totality (vs locality).  You can always look at asmall part of the macrocosm,  yet those miniature pieces are still apart of the total essence.  So the facts to observe are those whichpertain to what questions you're asking.  You may place a value on thequestions,  but in many case,  they are being asked just for the sakeof asking.  And you can say that you're looking at a signal instead oflistening to noise,  but the beauty of science is that it takes bothinto account (the totality aspect).  For science to say that light isa wave and NOT a particle (or vice versa) would be to ignore the totalessence that is light (which is based upon the agreed upon definitions).Why even have definitions?  Why agree upon them?  Well, to communicate insuch a way so that many will understand what you are saying.

Now, I skimmed Acts and such, and I found a reference to this happeningto Stephen, but no others. Where does this apparently very widely heldbelief come from? Is there any evidence outside the Bible? Is there anyevidence *in* the Bible? I sure haven't found any...Briefly, no.  There is widespread folklore, but no good documentaryevidence, or even solid rumor, concerning the deaths of the Apostles.Further, the usual context of such arguments, as you observe, is "NoMartyrs for a Lie": i.e. the willingness of these people to die ratherthan recant is evidence for the truth of their belief.  This adds thequite stronger twist that the proposed martyrs must have been offeredthe chance of life by recanting.  Since we don't even know how orwhere they died, we certainly don't have this information.  (By theway, even in the case of Stephen it is not at all clear that he couldhave saved himself by recanting).  The willingness of true believersto die for their belief, be it in Jesus or Jim Jones, iswell-documented, so martyrdom in and of itself says little.

ALink: KSAND -- Private activities on the net.At the time Ezekiel was written, Israel was in apostacy again and if I'm not mistaken, Tyre was about to make war on Israel.  Like I said, the Prince of Tyre was the human ruler of Tyre.  He was a wicked man.  By calling Satan the King of Tyre, Ezekiel was saying that Satan is the real ruler over Tyre.Don't think my interpretation is neccessarily the orthodox Christian one, although most Christian Bible commentaries interpret the King of Tyre as being a reference to Satan.

Without delving into a deep discussion of>creationism vs evolutionism, Here's the (main) problem. The scenario you outline is reasonably consistent, but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only doesnot support it, but indicates something far different. The Earth, bylatest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life forabout 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (atmost) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that lifehas been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long beforethere were people. (Yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease...mostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) Heck, not justfossil evidence, but what we've been able to glean from genetic study showsthat disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was whatbrought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) thenhow could it exist before humans?>                             God created the original genetic code>perfect and without flaw.

I know of many evolutionary biologists, who know more aboutbiology than you claim to, who will strongly disagree with this. Thereis no evidence that the human genetic code (or any other) 'started off'in perfect condition. It seems to adapt to its envionment, in acollective sense. I'm really curious as to what you mean by 'thedegeneration of the genetic code'.>Human DNA, being more "complex", tends to accumulate errors adversely>affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the >simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in >causing infection and disease.  It is a bad combination. Umm. Nah, we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses andbacteria, and they to us. Only a very small percentage of microlife isharmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalbyconstant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonicplague used to be a really nasty disease, I'm sure you'll agree. Butit still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn't do asmuch damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but evenwhen people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than inthe past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptibledied off long ago, and because the really nasty variants 'overgrazed',(forgive the poor terminology, I'm an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) anddied off for lack of nearby hosts. I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a fewhundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer. It seems tobe getting less nasty w/age...>                                                          Hence>we have newborns that suffer from genetic, viral, and bacterial>diseases/disorders. Now, wait a minute. I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right?And, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. Itseems unlikely that Satan, who's making the diseases, would also gifthumans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases lesslethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems,imperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into usby God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planningahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immunesystem that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God madeour immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin andtheir descendents would need to fight off diseases?>This may be more of a mystical/supernatural explanation than you>are prepared to accept, but God is not responsible for disease.>Even if Satan had nothing to do with the original inception of>disease, evolution by random chance would have produced them since>humanity forsook God's protection. Here's another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by 'perfect' in thephrase, 'created... perfect and without flaw'? To my mind, a 'perfect'system would be incapable of degrading over time. A 'perfect' systemthat will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* aperfect system. At least, IMHO. Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on abunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmer's glue? That is, theoriginal genetic 'instructions' were perfect, but were 'written' ininferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart?If so, why could God not have used better materials? Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself,of did It just choose not to?[deletions]>In summary, newborns are innocent, but God does not cause their suffering. My main point, as I said, was that there really isn't any evidence forthe explanation you give. (At least, that I'm aware of.) But, I couldn'thelp making a few nitpicks here and there. :->Sincerely,Ray Ingles                  || The above opinions are probably                            || not those of the University ofingles@engin.umich.edu      || Michigan.

I'm curious to know what purpose people think these lists serve.Lists like this seem to value quantity over quality, an "argumentfrom article length."  And the list you have here is of poorerquality than most.  Since the quotes seem to be taken from anon-line bible, I doubt that there will be much problem withverses quoted inaccurately.  But that isn't the problem here.I've known a lot of fundamentalists in my life, but none whodenied that there were errors in transmission, etc.  And many ofthe contradictions here -- Solomon having 40,000 horse stalls inone verse, and 4,000 in another -- are just the sort ofcontradiction that fundies don't have a problem with, in myexperience.  So how do these sorts of contradictions amount toanything more than attacking a straw man?Some of the others are just silly, or rely on taking quotes outof context, or have reasonable explanations.  But even the onesthat are genuine contradictions need to have more said aboutthem than what is given here.  (At the very least, some effortshould be made to understand and respond to the common repliesgiven by fundies.)  Look for example at the research that DaveButler put into an article examining a false prophecy about Tyre.That would be an excellent start for an anti-inerrancy list thatwould have some teeth.  (One well-researched and documentedcontradiction is worth more than one hundred quotes taken outof context and thrown together in a list.)Lists like this that just toss a bunch of quotes together tomake a bible verse salad just don't cut it.  Those of us whowant to argue against inerrancy should find this sort of thingas embarassing as the fundies should find Josh McDowell.djP.S. You can find some good material at ftp.rutgers.edu in/pub/soc.religion.christian/others/contradictions.  The qualityis very uneven on both sides of the argument (it is just acompilation of things many people have written), but some ofit would be useful in an anti-inerrancy FAQ.  After exams, Imight be willing to help put it together.

Being able to distinguish some egregious terrorist from some saintly man of peace does not mean that you have a method for tellingwho's a terrorist in general.Of course we *try* to tell them apart, but for my moneyit's better to try with the full awareness that we allbring bias to the judgement than to imagine that we areusing some objective test.jon.

I know you are better informed than that.  The US has never invaded Nicaragua (as far as I know).  We liberated Grenada from the Cubansto protect US citizens there and to prevent the completion of a strategic air strip.  Panama we invaded, true (twice this century).  Vietnam?  We were invited in by the government of S. Vietnam.  (I guess we "invaded" Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, eh?)  Mexico?  We have invaded Mexico 2 or 3 times, once this century, but there were no missiles for anyone to shoot over here at that time.  Hawaii?  We liberated it from Spain.So if you mean by the word "invaded" some sort of military action wherewe cross someone's border, you are right 5 out of 6.  But normally"invaded" carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation.(If some nation "invades" the U.S. Virgin Islands, would they beinvading the Virgin Islands or the U.S.?)  So from this point ofview, your score falls to 2 out of 6 (Mexico, Panama).[...]> > What's a "peace-nik"?  Is that somebody who *doesn't* masturbate> over "Guns'n'Ammo" or what?  Is it supposed to be bad to be a peace-nik?No, it's someone who believes in "peace-at-all-costs".  In other words,a person who would have supported giving Hitler not only Austria andCzechoslakia, but Poland too if it could have averted the War.  And onewho would allow Hitler to wipe all *all* Jews, slavs, and political dissidents in areas he controlled as long as he left the rest of us alone."Is it supposed to be bad to be a peace-nik," you ask?  Well, it dependson what your values are.  If you value life over liberty, peace overfreedom, then I guess not.  But if liberty and freedom mean more to youthan life itself; if you'd rather die fighting for liberty than liveunder a tyrant's heel, then yes, it's "bad" to be a peace-nik.The problem with most peace-niks it they consider those of us who arenot like them to be "bad" and "unconscionable".  I would not have anyargument or problem with a peace-nik if they held to their ideals andstayed out of all conflicts or issues, especially those dealing with the national defense.  But no, they are not willing to allow us tolegitimately hold a different point-of-view.  They militate and many times resort to violence all in the name of peace.  (What rankhypocrisy!)  All to stop we "warmongers" who are willing to stand up and defend our freedoms against tyrants, and who realize that to doso requires a strong national defense.Time to get off the soapbox now.  :)[...]> --> Doug Graham         dgraham@bnr.ca         My opinions are my own.Regards,Jim B.

Regarding the verses relevant to nature, I preferto use Dr. Maurice Bucaille's translations (in his book, "The Bible, theQur'an and Science") for in general his translations are more literal. Maurice Bucaille translates the portion of the verse you are addressingas "...Each one is travelling with an orbit in its own motion."(Also note that "the celestial bodies" in the first translation quotedby you above is the translator's interpolation -- it is not existent inthe original Arabic, which is why it is included in brackets.) >Perhaps someone who can read the original Arabic can eliminate one of>these interpretations; at any rate, neither one of them is exactly>impressive.You're right, what the verses _do_ contain isn't all that remarkable.However, Dr. Bucaille (a surgeon, that's how he's a "Dr.") thinks it issignificant that the above verse contains no geocentric ideas, eventhough geocentrism was all the rage up until the 17th century (?) or so.(And this goes for the rest of the Qur'an as well, which has about 750verses or so regarding nature, I think I remember reading once.)

My response is then: you have given no reason for your statementthat sex is not the business of religion (one of your "arguments").The urge for sex in adolescents is not so strong that any overly strongmeasures are required to suppress it. If the urge to have sex is sostrong in an adult then that adult can make a commensurate effort tofind a marriage partner.Gregg

I am defending myhonest opinion that this book should not be construed as a calculated(or otherwise) insulting attack on Islam, and the parallel opinionthat most of the criticism of the book I have seen is baselesspropaganda.

I've been thinking about this every now and then since I cut my tieswith Christianity. It is surprising to note that a large majority ofpeople, at least in Finland, seem to be apatheists - even though90 % of the population are members of the Lutheran Church of Finland,religious people are actually a minority. Could it be possible that many people believe in god "just in case"?It seems people do not want to seek the truth; they fall prey to Pascal'sWager or other poor arguments. A small minority of those who do believereads the Bible regularly. The majority doesn't care - it believes,but doesn't know what or how. People don't usually allow their beliefs to change their lifestyle,they only want to keep the virtual gate open. A Christian would saythat they are not "born in the Spirit", but this does not disturb them.Religion is not something to think about. I'm afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossibledream. Religions have a strong appeal to people, nevertheless - a promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen to.Coupled with threats of eternal torture and the idea that ourmorality is under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop, too manypeople take the poison with a smile. Or just pretend to swallow(and unconsciously hope god wouldn't notice ;-) ): Also, how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a: higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking.

But then again a measuring stick must be drawn: somewhere, and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core,: than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie, how it: expresses its own selfishness.If logic and reason are valued, then I would claim that atheistic thinkingis of higher value than the theistic exposition. Theists make unnecessaryassumptions they believe in - I've yet to see good reasons to believein gods, or to take a leap of faith at all. A revelation would do.However, why do we value logic and reasoning? This questions bearssome resemblance to a long-disputed problem in science: why mathematicsworks?

That you have seen no evidence that there IS a Godis correct - neither have I. But lack of evidence for the existence of something is in NO WAY evidence for the non-existence of something (the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they disprove evolution the establish creation). You (personally) have never seen a neutrino before, but they exist. The "pink unicorn" analogy breaksdown and is rather naive. I have a scientific theory that explains the appearance of animal life - evolution. When I draw the conclusion that "pink unicorns" don't exist because I haven't seen them, this conclusionhas it's foundation in observation and theory. A "pink unicorn", ifit did exist, would be qualitatively similar to other known entities.That is to say, since there is good evidence that all life on earth hasevolved from "more primitive" ancestors these pink unicorns would share a common anscestory with horses and zebras and such. God, however,has no such correspondence with anything (IMO).

I'm making no argument what so ever and offering nodefinition so there is no fallacy. I'm not trying to convince you ofanything. *I* Believe - and that rests upon Faith. And it is inappropriateto apply the category of logic in this realm (unless someone tells youthat they can logically prove God or that they have "evidence" or ...,then the use of logic to disprove their claims if fine and necessary).BTW, an incomplete argument is not a fallacy - some things are notEVEN wrong. >  > (Deletion)> >One can never prove that God does or does not exist.

Maybe sucha response as you gave just comes naturally to you because somany people try to run their own private conception of God downyour throat. I, however, am not doing this. I am arguing one, andonly one, thing - that to make a positive assertion about somethingfor which there can in principle be no evidence for or againstrequires a leap - it requires faith.

In addition, people often request information which hasbeen posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, thealt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the followingtitles:   1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers   2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism   3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)   4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument   5.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Atheist ResourcesThis is article number 1.  Please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting.  Theothers are entirely optional.If you are new to Usenet, you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroupnews.announce.newusers.  The articles titled "A Primer on How to Work Withthe Usenet Community", "Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet"and "Hints on writing style for Usenet" are particularly relevant.  Questionsconcerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions.If you are unable to find any of the articles listed above, see the "FindingStuff" section below.

Truly free.  You may copy them and distribute themto anyone you wish.  However, please send any changes or corrections to theauthor, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; itdoes nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floatingaround the network.                                Finding StuffAll of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here aresome suggestions on what to do if you can't find them:1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with   "Alt.Atheism FAQ:".2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.   If you don't find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn't set up   correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the   problem.3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].   Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you'll find the latest   versions of the FAQ files there.   FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you   need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to   mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with      send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq   in the body.4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article   "Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup" carries a list of these   sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.5. If you don't have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu   consisting of the following lines:      send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources      send usenet/alt.atheism/faq      send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction      send usenet/alt.atheism/logic      send usenet/alt.atheism/resources5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of   the following lines:      send atheism/faq/faq.txt      send atheism/faq/logic.txt      send atheism/faq/intro.txt      send atheism/faq/resource.txt   and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.   There's other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are "help" and   "send atheism/index".6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this   if you've tried the above methods and they've failed; it's not nice to   clutter the newsgroup or people's mailboxes with requests for files.   it's better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,   people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don't have    FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files.mathew

Your generalismsare then misplaced -- atheism needn't imply materialism, or the lackof an absolute moral system.  However, I do tend to materialism anddon't believe in absolute morality, so I'll answer your questions.>How then can an atheist judge value? An atheist judges value in the same way that a theist does: accordingto a personal understanding of morality.  That I don't believe in anabsolute one doesn't mean that I don't have one.  I'm just explicit,as in the line of postings you followed up, that when I expressjudgment on a moral issue I am basing my judgment on my own coderather than claiming that it is in some absolute sense good or bad.My moral code is not particular different from that of others aroundme, be they Christians, Muslims, or atheists.  So when I say that Iobject to genocide, I'm not expressing anything particularly out ofline with what my society holds.If your were to ask why I think morality exists and has the form itdoes, my answer would be mechanistic to your taste -- that a moralcode is a prerequisite for a functioning society, and that humanityprobably evolved morality as we know it as part of the evolution ofour ability to exist in large societies, thereby achievingconsiderable survival advantages.  You'd probably say that God justmade the rules.  Neither of us can convince the other, but we share acommon understanding about many moral issues.  You think you get itfrom your religion, I think I get it (and you get it) from earlychildhood teaching.>That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God>or God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your>nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled>with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. I think you've been reading the wrong sort of comic books, but inprying through the gobbledygook I basically agree with what you'resaying.  I do believe that my mental reactions to stimuli such as "Godcommanded the genocide of the Canaanites" is mechanistic, but ofcourse I think that's true of you as well.  My reaction has little todo with whether God exists or even with whether I think he does, butif a god existed who commanded genocide, I could not consider himgood, which is supposedly an attribute of God.>All of this being so, you have excluded>yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,>etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no>weight whatsoever.Hmm.  Yes, I think some heavy FAQ-reading would do you some good.  Ihave as much place discussing values etc. as any other person.  Infact, I can actually accomplish something in such a discussion, byframing the questions in terms of reason: for instance, it is clearthat in an environment where neighboring tribes periodically attemptto wipe each other out based on imagined divine commands, then thequality of life will be generally poor, so a system that fosterscoexistence is superior, if quality of life is an agreed goal.  Anabsolutist, on the other hand, can only thump those portions of aBible they happen to agree with, and say "this is good", even if theact in question is unequivocally bad by the standards of everyone inthe discussion.  The attempt to define someone or a group of people as"excluded from discussion", such that they "cannot participate", andtheir opinions given "no weight whatsoever" is the lowest form orreasoning (ad hominem/poisoning the well), and presumably the resortof someone who can't rationally defend their own ideas of right,wrong, and the Bible.-- Jim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NCThese are my opinions.

In many types ofexperiments the "prediction" is that the observed phenomena will happen againand be capable of being observed. For example, in chemistry someone may predict: the outcome of a chemical reaction and then actually observe that reactionrepeatedly. You can't repeat or ever know for sure the original conditions that produced life. So it seems we could never say, "That's exactly how it happened."As far as we know that event was unobserved. (At least no one has admitted: it. :-) ) So unlike the chemistry experiment repeatability and observability,: strictly speaking, are lacking.: -- Can't resist, because I've thought about it...Basically what is being constructed is a theory of abiogenesis.There are any number of criterion that would have to be satisfied forthe theory to be accurate, such as the hotly discussed topic ofstereoisomerism.  Just making life in the lab wouldn't suffice (forall the wonder that would engender!), because for the theory ofabiogenesis to be accurate, the life would have to resemble the bestidea we have of what the earliest lifeforms resembled.Comes down to that old question "Can we ever really be sure?"But if were to examine a claim that abiogenesis had beendemonstrated in the laboratory AND was the most likely path followed onprimordial Earth, I would look for the following:1)  Experiment reproduced a plausible primordial Earthenvironment;2)  ALL contamination sources were eliminated;3)  The lifeform produced resembles primitive/simple Earthlifeforms;4)  The theory accounts for differences in the modernEarth environment and primitive Earth environment.NOW, if those criteria were satisfied, Dr. Abio, who performed theexperiment, would then be in possession of the best candidate fora theory of abiogenesis on the primordial Earth.  At which point Dr.BBio could then counter with a decisive critique keyed on an aspectof the theory which doesn't match the early Earth environment, ora characteristic of the new "lifeform" that doesn't resemble lifeon Earth.  Were he to suggest an improvement to eliminate thediscrepancies, and perform an experiment to demonstrate his claims,Dr. BBio would then have the best theory.Never provable;  constantly modifiable;  progressing evercloser to the "correct" answer, until the evidence is overwhelming(and even when it is, a theory that explains even MORE may take itsplace) ------- that's a scientific theory.===========================================================|  James G.

She finally got the clue that she couldn't help.During that period she bought me "I was atheist, now I'm Xtian" booksfor my birthday and Xmas several times. Our birthday cards would containverses. It was a problem. I told my mom that I was going to send mysister an atheist piece of reading material. I got a "Don't you dare".My mom wasn't religious. Why did she insist that I not send it ??   Because our society has driven into us that religion is ok topreach, non-religion should be self contained.

The term 'rational' does not apply to a simple statement like that.You would have to include the statement within a syllogism andassert the rationility of the syllogism.A statement is just a statement.  As to its objectivity - well it depends what you mean.Values tend to be regarded as good or bad, valid or invalid, true or false,and so on.  Objective values are those which must fall into one or other ofthose options for all people - or, if you are prepared for dissent, thenthey are those values which should be accepted by everyone.If someone rejects an objective value they are regarded as 'wrong'.Objective values require a fundamental notion of good versus bad, or atleast right versus wrong (or even just correct versus incorrect) anda way of relating that to specific aspects of human behaviour.In my opinion that requires a belief in a deity of some sort.Suppose you could predict with almost 100% accuracy that Americansbelieved that something is better than nothing.You could usefully say that the existence of that value was anobjective fact.  You could not say that the value itself wasobjective.   You could not do that unless you could prove that thevalue was 'right'.  Showing that everyone happens to accept the valueas right doesn't show that it is right.>Do you agree with me then that the assertion "no values are objective" >is false?Well I am a believer in a God.  So I do believe that some values areobjective.  But I usually suspend that belief when posting to t.abecause it immediately invalidates subsequent arguments in the mindof many t.a readers.So, ignoring the idea of a God, I disagree with you.I believe, in this limited context, that 'no values are objective'.But I think that this thread is showing some cross-purpose debate.I think I understand your use of the word 'objective' whenrelating it to values.

I submit that you don't answer them because youcannot answer them without running afoul of your own logic, and I onceagain challenge you to prove me wrong.  To make the task as easy foryou as possible, I'll present concise re-statements of some of thequestions that you have failed to answer, in the hope that you mayaddress them one at a time for all to see.Should you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period, Iwill re-post this article, with suitable additions and deletions, atsuch time that I notice a post by you on another topic.  I will repeatthis procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges oryou cease to post to this newsgroup.I would like to apologize in advance if you have answered any of thesequestions previously and your answer missed my notice.  If you can bekind enough to re-post or e-mail such articles, I will be only toopleased to publicly rescind the challenge in question, and remove itfrom this list.Now, to the questions...1. After claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychologicalpatterns that you proposed, then semi-retracting that claim by statingthat you weren't referring to *all* atheists, I asked you to name someatheists who you feel don't fit your patterns, to show that you indeedwere not referring to all atheists that you are aware of.  You failedto do so.  Please do so now.Question: Can you name any a.a posters who do not fit into yourstereotype?Here is the context for the question:>>> This is not true for everyone on this board, and you are out of line>>> in assuming that it is.>>>>YOU, however, deleted the text further along where I said that I didn't mean>>to imply that everybody's experience was along the same lines.  >>Whether or not you *mean* to make such implications, you do so>repeatedly.  >>Allow me to approach the issue from another viewpoint: can you name>those atheists that you've come across who *do not* fit into the>patterns that you theorize?2. You have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that "senses andreason are all we have to go by", and when pressed, you have impliedthat we have an alternative called revelation.  I have repeatedlyasked you to explain what revelation is and how one can bothexperience and interpret revelation without doing so via our sensesand reason.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.Question: Can you explain what is revelation and how one canexperience and interpret it without using senses and inherentreasoning?Here is the context for the question:>>Revelation is not reason, and if we DO have revelation, then>>reasoning is NOT all we have.>First, show me that revelation exists.  Second, if revelation is not>perceived through the senses, how exactly is it perceived?  According>to my Webster's, revelation is "an act of revealing or communicating>divine truth."  Now, tell me how such a thing can be revealed/>communicated other than via the senses?  Tell me how you can interpret>this revelation other than with reason, that is, using your brain to>interpret what you are sensing.  When I say there is no way for a>human being to interface with the universe other than via the senses as>interpreted by reason (your brain), it is because this is the simple>truth.  If you have another mechanism of interface, by all means,>share it with us.then later...>>>You CANNOT escape the fact that our entire interface with the universe is>>>our senses and our reason, period.>>>>Again, this is indefensible.  >>No, it is simple truth.  I challenge you to show me otherwise.then later...>>Few mystics will agree to this assertion, and the common defense of>>redefining "senses" to absorb (for instance) mystical experiences is>>begs the question of whether some senses are better than others.>>I allow you the broadest definition of senses, to make things easier>for you.  Now, show me that "mystical experiences" exist.  Remember,>you aren't allowed to go by testimony of others (e.g., mystics), since>you have dismissed my testimony as unreliable - you know, tainted by>my own bias.  Further, once these mystical thingies are absorbed, show>me evidence that a human can recognize and respond to them short of>interpretation via that person's reasoning capabilities.>>I challenge you to show me these things.  If you cannot do so, you>might as well give up the fight.then later...>Let me reiterate, you have NOT explained your interpretation of your>experiences, so it is not possible for me to have attacked them.  In>point of fact, I specifically challenged you to explain this>revelation stuff that you were talking about, and I note for the>record that you appear to have declined my challenge.>>*What* is it?  *How* is it sensed?  *How* is it interpreted?  And>*how* does this sensing and interpretation occur without the conduit>of our senses and reasoning abilities?  You have answered none of>these questions that go straight to the heart of your claims.  If you>can't answer them, your claims are entirely specious.3.  You have stated that all claims to dispassionate analysis made bya.a posters are unverifiable and fantastical.  I asked you to identifyone such claim that I have made.  You have failed to do so.  Please doso now.Question: Have I made any claims at all that are unverifiable andfantastical?  If so, please repeat them.Here is the context for the question:>>I must thank David Wood a most sensitive and intelligent (if wrong :-))>>posting.  then later...>>Likewise, the reference to "unverifiable, fantastical>>claims" represents fairly accurately my reaction to all of the claims to>>dispassionate analysis that are repeated in this group.>>Give me your address and I'll be pleased to send you a dictionary.>Failing that, can you name ONE claim that I have made that is in any>sense unverifiable or fantastical?  I demand that you retract this>statement if you cannot offer up evidence.  If you follow your usual>pattern of ignoring the challenge, then you are simply an asshole.4.  First you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists asa result of reason, then later you stated that if one accepted the"axioms" of reason that one couldn't help but become atheist.  I askedyou to explain the contradiction.  Your only response was a statementthat the question was incoherent, an opinion not shared by others thatI have asked, be they atheist or theist.  You have failed to answerthe question.  Please do so now.Question: Do you retract your claim that a.a posters have not becomeatheists as a result of reason, despite their testimony to thateffect?  If you don't retract that claim, do you retract thesubsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitablyresult in atheism?Here is the context for the question:[First quote]>>...we have here a bunch of people who claim that their position is>>based on reason... it is up to atheists to prove it to me...>>then,>[Second quote]>>...but I do not see how one can accept these axioms and not end up with>>an atheistic point of view.5.  First, you claimed that you would (probably) not answer theseChallenges because they contained too much in the way of "includedtext" from previous posts.  Later, you implied that you wouldn'trespond because I was putting words in your mouth.  Please clarifythis seeming contradiction.Question:  Do you prefer to respond to Challenges that include contextfrom your own posts, or that I paraphrase your positions in order toavoid "included text"?Here is the context for the question:First you said:>>My ordinary rules are that I don't read articles over over 150 lines>>or articles in which there is nothing but included text on the first>>screen.  THese are not rules of morality, but practicality.then later...>>If someone is not going to argue with MY version of MY position, then>>they cannot be argued with.As usual, your responses are awaited with anticipation.--Dave Woodp.s., For the record, below is a compilation of Charley's responses tothese challenges to date.3/18/93>>This makes no sense to me at all; it gives the appearance either of utter>>incoherence, or of answering some question of Mr. Wood's imagination.3/31/93 (#1)>>Mr. Wood, I do not subscribe to the opinion that a gauntlet thrown down on>>the net requires any response whatsoever.

What are your thoughts on it?  I read it when it first came out, and the controversy broke. Put my nameon the waiting list at the library (that way if the book was reallyoffensive, none of my money would find its way to the author orpublisher), and read it, "cover to cover" (to use a phrase that seemspopular here right now).And I *liked* it. The writing style was a little hard to get used to, butit was well worth the effort. Coming from a similar background (Rushdiegrew up in Bombay in a muslim family, and moved to England; I grew up inNew Delhi), it made a strong impression on me.  (And he used many of thestrange constructions of Indian English: the "yaar" at the end of asentence, "Butbutbut," the occasional hindi phrase, etc.)At the time I still "sorta-kinda" thought of myself as a muslim, and Icouldn't see what the flap was all about. It seemed clear to me that thiswas allegory.  It was clear that he described some local prostitutes whotook on the names and personae of Muhammed's wives, and had not (as mygrandfather thundered) implied that Muhammed's wives were prostitutes; inshort, every angry muslim that had read even part of the book seemed tohave missed the point completely.  (And I won't mention the fact that themost militant of them had never even seen the book. Oops, I just did!)Perhaps in a deep sense, the book is insulting to Islam, because itexposes the silliness of revealed religion - why does an omnipotent deityneed an agent? She can come directly to me, can't she? How do we know thatMuhammed didn't just go out into the desert and smoke something? And howdo we know that the scribes he dictated the Quran to didn't screw up, orput in their own little verses? And why can Muhammed marry more than fourwomen, when no other muslim is allowed to? (Although I think the biggestinsult to Islam is that the majority of its followers would want tosuppress a book, sight unseen, on the say-so of some "holy" guy. Not tomention murder the author.)>Over the years, when I have made this point, various primarily muslim>posters have responded, saying that yes indeed they have read the book>and had called it such things as "filth and lies", "I would rank>Rushdie's book with Hitler's Mein Kempf or worse", and so on.I had much the same response when I tried to talk about the book. A reallysilly argument - after all, how many of these same people have read "MeinKampf?" It just made me wonder - what are they afraid of?

Kevin, unfortunately you are now delving into field I know too littleabout, algorithms. Your reasoning, as I see it, is very much along thelines of Roger Penrose, who claimed that mathematical 'insight' cannotbe algorithmic in his book _The emperor's new mind: Concerningcomputers, minds, and the laws of physics_. However, Penrose'sclaim that he _has_ mathematical insight, or your similar claimthat wavefunctions collapse only when we consciously take a look,could be just illusions.We are obviouslu taking very different viewpoints - I try to ponderon the problem of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective,realising that it might not be anything special, but certainlyuseful. Thinking back of what I wrote, do you think worms have mindsor not? They are able to experience pain, at least they behave just like that. Yet it is conceivable that we might some dayin the future perform a "total synthesis of C. elegans" fromthe elements. Would such a worm have a mind?> Firstly, I'm not impressed with the ability of algorithms. They're> great at solving problems once the method has been worked out, but not> at working out the method itself.This is true to some extent. However, I do not think that our brainswork like computers, at all. In fact, there is substantial evidence(Skarda, 1985; Skarda & Freeman 1987) that brains work more or lesschaotically, generating enough randomness for mental states to evolve.Our brains work much like genetic algorithm generators, I suppose.> the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered.

I suggest, however, that before trying tounderstand our consciousness as a collection of algorithms. Kevin, take a look at the references I mentioned, and think again.I still think the best experts on the nature of a conscious mindare neurologists, neuropsychologists and biologists (but do not flame me for my opinions), since they study beings that areconscious. The reason I am repeating my advice is that this discussion cannotlead to anywhere if our backgrounds are too different.And please, do not bring QM into this discussion at all - notall physicists are happy with the claim that our consciousnessplays some special role in physics. I would say it doesn't.> The other problem with algorithms is their instability.

Don't forget this. This does notmean they need something else to work - they just work differently.Their primary 'purpose' is perception and guidance of action, self-awareness and high intelligence are later appearances.> The next problem is the sticky question of "What is colour?" (replace> 'colour' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, the> materialist viewpoint is that it's the product of some kind of> chemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy +> different chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these?You are still expecting that we could find the idea of 'green' inour brains somewhere, perhaps in the form of some chemical. This isnot how I see it. The sensation 'green' is a certain time-dependentpattern in the area V4 of our visual cortex, and it is distributedwith the help of areas V1 and V2 to the rest of the brain. Indeed, a firing pattern. I have sometimes thought of our consciousnessas a global free induction pattern of these local firing patterns,but this is just idle speculation.Scientific American's September 1992 issue was a special issue onmind and brain. Have you already read it from cover to cover? ;-)There are two articles on visual perception, so you might be interested.But again, please note that subjective experiences cannot be observed from a third-person perspective. If we see nothing but neuronal activity, we cannot go on to conclude that this is not themind.Kalat (1988) writes about numerous examples where electric stimulationof different areas of brain have led to various changes in the patients' state of mind. For instance, a patient whose septal areawas stimulated (without his knowledge) by remote control duringa psychiatric interview was quickly cured of his depression, andstarted discussing a plan to seduce his girlfriend.Stimulations in the temporal lobe have sometimes led to embarrassingsituations, when the patients have started flirting with thetherapist.In conclusion, there is evidence that1) brains are essentially necessary for subjective experiences,    brain damage is usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage2) conscious processes involve substantial brain activity in   various areas of brain - when we think of colours, our   visual cortex is activated etc.3) consciousness is an afterthought - we become conscious of our   actions with a half a second delay, and our brains are ahead   of our 'conscious will' by at least 350 ms. Thus, I think it is fruitful to turn the question "Why do 'I' seecolours" around and ask "What is this 'I' that seems to be observing?", since it seems that our conscious mind is notthe king of our brains.> If this is so, a> computer won't see colour, because the chemistry is different.

So why do> we see colour?This depends on what is meant by 'seeing colours'. Does a neuralnetwork that is capable of recognising handwritten numbers from0 to 9 see the numbers, if it is capable of sorting them?If you are asking, "why does an animal who is conscious of itselfas an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal whodoesn't", I have a good answer - read my previous posting,where I wrote why a sense of identity helps social animals to swaproles and act more morally, so that they don't unconsciouslykill each other with newly discovered weapons. (A bit extreme,but this is the basic idea.)When early _Homo_ became more and more efficient in using tools, a sense of identity and the concept of 'self' had to evolve inline with this development. Indeed, respect for others and conscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantagesfor social animals, such as early humans. > If I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction,> with two processes acting on it.

If you're interested in a change, here's an idea.Do you believe in absolute morality? And do you have absoluteknowledge? Mere mortal you? And if you claim that your God has absoluteknowledge, then you have have absolute knowledge of that?If you read the Bible and claim that it is the Word of God, andin it is contained the absolute moral code you ascribe to, but the prophets,no matter how divinely inspired are not gods but mere fallable mortals,then how can you be absolutely sure that they having heard the Word ofGod, have got it right? Also, you read their words in translation whichinvariably introduces errors of nuance and usage, and then how do youknow that you got the right message? I assert that you do not, and thatyou do not have absolute knowledge of anything, including absolute morals.The only way you can assert such things is through appeal toprejudice via appeal by force of authority through yourself or a groupyou have aligned yourself to.>If morals come from what is societally accepted, why follow that? Because social pressure is the most powerful force known toman. How can you disprove a contention that the richeousness ofestablished religion is anything other than social convention? Oneway is to assert that there are moral universals. But that is notthe same thing as asserting that these universials owe their origento trancendance or the supernatural or to dieties.>What right do>we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally mandated morality?We expect empathy from our fellow man. We expect to raise eachgeneration with values that we live by, those which assure that mistakeswe have made are not repeated. Do you think that mere authority checksall tendancies which are disruptive of civilized life? I think not! In factauthority is power, and power corrupts. The most powerful tend to thinkthat they are above the law that applies to everybody else. Religiousauthority, theocarcy, has not mitigated this any better than otherpower structures on this score and it seems that because there are nochecks on power concentrated in clergy or nobility that the abusesrecorded by history are greater.We live and teach morals by setting an example, starting inthe home. This does not come from books or authority figures insoceity. If people are weak or confused at the present time it isnot because the breakup of the family has been precipitated by somemysterious moral decidance that redidication to traditional formulaswill repair. That is but magical and simplistic thinking. We need tolook at forces in the way we live, even the good things that happenin our present culture, that are weakening the family as the primarymeans we have to teach children values. Of course people are tryingto have the community do things that once were done in the familyalone. This may not be as effective. We need to look at this.>Pardon the extremism, but couldn't I murder your "brother" and say> that I was >exercising my rights as I saw them, was doing what felt good, didn't want>anyone forcing their morality on me, or I don't follow your "morality" ?Laying down the law, and with teeth, doesn't stop the crazyman from murdering your brother despite the morality or the law. Itmay help you with dealing promptly with him after the fact, but itmay not be very effective for preventing mental illness or cracy peoplefrom murduring.It is quite interesting how ineffective moral authoritarianismis in fact. It may work best in societies that are already sonmewhatisolated, that do not experience change, and have long standingtraditions. In a basic way moral codes decrease the number of decisionspeople have to make everyday. In a real sense thay allow people to nothave to think. That is OK when things are stable, but it becomes aproblem when conditions change. This leads me to think that morals arenot sumething fundemental, at least most of them, recalling that thereare values all people seem to agree on, but mutate in response to outsidepolitical, economic, technical, and cultural influiences.Lately, I have come to regard people who speak like youwith great suspicion, especially when they include the pharse "forthe children.". I think that such people are more of an imparative towant to  control what others do and think than other more nobil pursuits,such as of the truth.Bruce Salem

Campbell. Truly a beautiful book. A follow-up book(if you can find a decent translation) is "Wilaya - The Stationof the Master" by the same author. I think it also goes under thetitle of "Master and Mastership" - It's a very small book - reallyjust a transcription of a lecture by the author.The introduction to the beautiful "Psalms of Islam" - translatedby William C. Chittick (available through Muhammadi Trust ofGreat Britain) is also an excellent introduction to the subject. Wehave these books in our University library - I imagine any wellstocked University library will have them.From your posts, you seem fairly well versed in Sunni thought.

That is, if there were no deathpenalty, would its introduction deter a would-be criminal fromcommitting her/his crime?  I doubt it.This is only the first step.  Even if it were a strong deterrent(short of being a complete deterrent) I would reject it.  For whatabout the case of the innocent executed?And even if we could eliminate this possibility, I would reject thedeath penalty as immoral. This makes me something of a radical onthe issue, although I think there are many opponents of captialpunishment who agree with me, but who find the innocent executed thestrongest argument to make.I would, if magically placed in charge, facilitate state-aided suicidefor criminals who have life-sentences.

Your mileage may vary.Yes I fully agree with that, but is it "I don't believe gods exist", or"I believe no gods exist"? As MANDTBACKA@FINABO.ABO.FI (Mats Andtbacka)pointed out, it all hinges on what you take the word "believe" to mean.Unfortunately this is bound up in the definitions of strong and weakatheism, at least according to the FAQ:# Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.# Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is# often referred to as the "weak atheist" position, and the latter as "strong# atheism".# # It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  "Weak# atheism" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  "Strong# atheism" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not# fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are "strong atheists".(From mathew's "An Introduction to Atheism" version 1.2 last modified 5-Apr-93)Should the FAQ be clarified to try to pin down this notion of "belief"?Can it?-- Tony Lezard IS tony@mantis.co.uk OR tony%mantis.co.uk@uknet.ac.uk OR thingslike tony%uk.co.mantis@uk.ac.nsfnet-relay OR (last resort) arl10@phx.cam.ac.ukPGP 2.2 public key available on request.

Who is he? >Please do not answer with "A well known evolutionist" or some other such>informationless phrase.   Francis Hitching is the author of, among other books,_The Neck of the Giraffe_." He believes evolution isdirected by some sort of cosmic force, but does not likeDarwinism.  He wrote in this book [ _The Neck of theGiraffe_, Ticknor & Fields, New Haven, Connecticut, 1982,p. 12 (p. 4, paperback)] that:   For all its acceptance in the scientific world as the   great unifying principle of biology, Darwinism, after   a century and a quarter, is in a surprising amount of   trouble.  Evolution and Darwinism are often taken to   mean the same thing.  But they don't.  Evolution of   life over a very long period of time is a fact, if we   are to believe evidence gathered during the last two   centuries from geology, paleontology, molecular biol-   ogy and many other scientific disciplines.  Despite   the many believers in Divine creation who dispute this   ..., the probability that evolution has occurred   approaches certainty in scientific terms....  On the   other hand Darwinism (or neo-Darwinism, its modern   version) is a theory that seeks to explain evolution.   It has not, contrary to general belief, and despite   very great efforts, been proved.   Research on Hitching turned up the following: Hitching isbasically a sensational TV script writer and has no scien-tific credentials.  In _The Neck of the Giraffe_ he claimedto be a member of the Royal Archaeological Institute, but aninquiry to that institute said he was not.  He implied inthe "Acknowledgements" of _The Neck of the Giraffe_ thatpaleontologist Stephen Jay Gould had helped in the writingof the book, but upon inquiry Gould said he did not know himand had no information about him.  Hitching also impliedthat his book had been endorsed by Richard Dawkins, but uponinquiry Dawkins stated: "I know nothing at all about FrancisHitching.  If you are uncovering the fact that he is a char-latan, good for you.  His book, _The Neck of the Giraffe,_is one of the silliest and most ignorant I have read foryears."   Hitching believes in the paranormal and has written onMayan pyramid energy and for some "In Search Of..." episodeson BBC television.  The reference work _ContemporaryAuthors,_ Vol. 103, page 208, lists him as a member of theSociety for Psychical Research, the British Society ofDowsers and of the American Society of Dowsers.  His writ-ings include: _Earth Magic,_ _Dowsing: The Psi Connection,__Mysterious World: An Atlas of the Unexplained,_ _Fraud,Mischief, and the Supernatural_ and _Instead of Darwin_.   Hitching's book spends much of its time attacking Dar-winian evolution, borrowing heavily and uncritically fromyoung-earth creationist arguments.  Many of Hitching's "ref-erences" are lifted from young-earth creationist literaturerather than being quoted directly from their originalsources.  One magazine had this to say [_Creation/EvolutionNewsletter_, 7, No. 5, pp. 15-16, September/October 1987]:   Speaking of the Biblical Creation Society, there was   an interesting letter in the January 1983 issue of   their journal Biblical Creation (p. 74) concerning a   review of Francis Hitching's 1982 book _The Neck of   the Giraffe_.  Hitching's book is strongly anti-   Darwinist, and is enthusiastically hailed by most cre-   ationists (though he also pokes fun at fundamentalist   creationists).  The letter, by creationist Malcolm   Bowden (author of _The Rise of the Evolution Fraud_),   points out that Hitching simply "culled his informa-   tion from the creationist literature."  This is indeed   the case:  many creationist works are cited favorably   (Anderson, Coffin, Clark, Daly, Davidheiser, Dewar,   Gish, Morris, Segraves, Whitcomb, and Wysong, plus   various anti-Darwinists).  Hitching does cite Bowden's   earlier book _Ape-Men -- Fact or Fallacy?_, but Bowden   accuses Hitching of "lifting" several passages and   illustrations from his book without acknowledgment:   in other words, plagiarism.  "Hitchin's [sic] book is   largely an exposition of the creationists [sic] view-   point from the beginning to almost the end," Bowden   points out....  Hitching is also a paranormalist, an   advocate of psychic evolution.... [Hitching's book]   _Earth Magic_ is a wild, extremely entertaining and   thoroughly psychic interpretation of megalithic struc-   tures....  Hitching also includes in his scheme cosmic   cataclysms, Atlantis, pyramidology, dowsing, ESP,   miraculous healing, and astrology.-------------------------------------------------------Alan Feuerbacheralanf@atlas.pen.tek.com

We have here the quintessential Christian: he sets up asystem of values/beliefs for himself, which work very well, and everyevent/experience is understandable and deablable within the framework of thissystem.  However, we also have an individual who has the inability (at leastnot without some difficulty) to change, which is important, because the problemwith such a system is the same as with any system: one cannot be open minded tothe point of "testing hypotheses" against the basic premise of the systemwithout destroying whatever faith is invested therein, unless of course, allthe tests fail.  In other words, the *fairer* way would be to test and evaluatemoralities without the bias/responsibility of losing/retaining a system.> > I claimed that a ``Christian philosopher'' is not a Christian,> but is a person whose beliefs at the moment correspond with those> of Christianity.

For to show no interest in the existence of god takes nofaith at all.  You make the presumption that the _knowledge_ of the _possibility_ of something is enough to require faith to render that possibilty of no interest.  It is a very different thing to saythat you don't believe something than it is to say that you don'thave sufficent reason to believe something is even interesting to think about.  It's not either or.  Sometimes is just something elsemore interesting that occupies your mind.  I agree that faith and dogma are inevitable, but not necessarilyapplied to god and religion.  It takes both faith and dogma toexpect the sun to come up every morning, but there is overwhelmingreason every single day, day in and day out, for _everyone_ to put his faith and dogma there.

All of the writers musthave received their information from the early Christians,perhaps second or third hand.  None of these references give anyhint that the writers had any independent information aboutJesus. These references do show that the early Christians were having aninfluence, at least enough to earn a few lines here and there inother peoples' writings.  But the typical use to which they areput by some Christian apologists, in making psuedo-historicalarguments a la Josh, is totally specious.Russell

Luckily these parameters are fixed by reality.Suppose X-ist saucers land.  The aliens destroy all paper currency and tattoo"666" on people's foreheads and start sacrificing small children.  Then abunch of other aliens come along and offer to get rid of the X-ists in returnfor one dollar.  The people happen to have a single dollar bill hidden duringthe purge.Get the point?  None of these events are *inherently* impossible.  So it isnot the case that the value of a dollar bill is fixed by reality.For a more mundane example of how the value of a dollar bill is not constant,consider the following game thought up by the RAND corporation:You are with a bunch of friends.

It should be clear from my response to Bill Rawlins above that in this thread I am objecting only to the use of Josephus to validate the messiah claim.  The argument against themessiah claim is not weak (maybe mine is, but in the hands of pros it is not).There are indeed two passages.  The short one *cannot be used* to validate themessiah claim, imo.  That's why I refered to the long, which can be used.  It flatly states Jesus "was the Christ", and mentions the crucifixion, resurrection and Christian belief in said claims.The short entry mentions Jesus in passing as James' brother - "... brother ofJesus, who *was called* the Christ, .... [emphasis mine]", and that's it. If original, Josephus has merely reported what some people say.  It is nothing more than an observation, one which lacks the Christian fundamentals.The long is widely regarded as an insert for three reasons: 1) its way out ofcontext, 2) Origen evidently knew nothing of it, and 3) its rather inconsistentwith the short.  There is consensus among scholars as defined on the long as insert, and I see Jim agrees.  Consensus is usually reflected subtly, as inElaine Pagel's _Gnostic Gospels_ (p. 85), "A comment *attributed* to Josephusreports ....[emphasis mine]".  As for #2, I mentioned in my original post that the long is a 3rd century insert (more properly, post-Origen as Jim notes).There may not be consensus on the short.  The text, which discusses James in alegal role, stands with or without it.  That it does not upset context makes itdifficult to argue insert.  On the other hand, an in-passing insert is easilydisguised in any context.  Nonetheless, on historiographical grounds it is worthless for the messiah defense, and that's why I didn't mention it. I don't know about the Arabic ms.  If you have a translation reference, Jim,please let me know.  As for its "much less gung-ho" tone, obviously the date of this ms. is critical.  If after ca. AD 700, a watered-down entry in lieu of removal can be easily explained.*<(:-)Rich Fox, Anthro, Usouthdakota

I doubt if the market for them exists there -- at least notwhile "Islamic banks" are at a relatively early stage of theirdevelopment as is the case now.  BCCI is most certainly not an "Islamicbank" -- did BCCI ever pay a fixed interest rate on deposits?  If theanswer to this question is "yes", then BCCI was not an Islamic bank, asIslamic banks are specifically set up to _not_ pay or charge interest.Whether some Muslims partially owned the bank or whatever is completelyirrelevant.

Further, I think that it is logically necessary for the laws of our universe be confined to this universeitself.Why do I believe this? It is simple; I believe that the odds againstthere being only one universe and that universe having the right conditionsto support us are infinate. I believe that to explain our existance inthis universe it is necessary to either consider multiple universes(an infinate number of them) or intelligent design. Since the onlyintelligence that we know of is of a higher order than simple matter(the brain is made of matter) by Ockham's razor I go for the firstchoice.What's more, there are a couple of books out dealing with popularscience that use parallel universes and holographic universes (whichis another way of saying parallel) to explain the behavior of particalsat the quantum level. One is called Parallel Universes, and I think itis by Wolf, the other The Holographic Universe.BTW, the parallel universe approach implys an element of mind in thevery physical reality of the universe. >Bruce Salem>eric

There is a difference between calling>evolution a fact and talking about the theory of evolution providing>facts (I happen to think the latter is more accurate ).I hate doing this, because it's been done so many times before, but...Evolution, in the nonscientific sense, is change.  Although it isoften used in a colloquial manner to refer to phenomena that tendtoward higher complexity and ability, evolution simply implies change,for good or for bad.  In the scientific sense, evolution is merely thechange in allele frequencies for a given population over a period oftime.  This is usually what people refer to when they discuss thescientific fact of evolution.  We observe such shifts in allelefrequencies occurring all the time, so it is trivial to conclude thatevolution is a scientific fact.The mechanisms that enable such changes in allele frequencies arecollectively known as the theory of evolution.  Darwin's naturalselection is one such theory.  Genetic drift is another.  Gene flow isstill another.Evolution is a fact and a theory.

For one, your claim that everyone senses it#is not founded, and you have been asked to give evidence for it often.#And then, the correct statement would be it is reason to assume that it#is there unless evidence against it has been found.I have no problem with the second statement.  I have provided anargument that almost everyone senses that Freedom is valuable - theonly cogent objection to this came from jon livesey, and was offeredby some other people too: essentially, that people disagree aboutfuzzy concepts such as Freedom.  It's a good point, and I'm thinkingabout it.# #Your trick is to say, I feel A is not right, and so do many I know,#therefore A is absolutely right. It neglects the possibility that#these people consider A to be right as an effect of the same process,#restricting the claim of its absoluteness to those who have been subject#of that process. In other words, refutes it. You make the ontological#claim, you have to prove it.Nonsense.  My "trick" is to say:  I feel that A is better than B and so does almost any disinterested person I ask.  Best evidence is therefore that A really is better than B, subject to the assumption that wecan establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by A and B, andthat the resulting system of values is self-consistent.Now get this:  "really is better" is an idealisation, a fictional model,in the same sense that "real material existence" is a fictional model. Itmay or may not correspond to something true.  It is nonetheless a useful_assumption_.  Far more useful than the equally assumed relativist "trick", to wit:I feel that A is better than B, and so does almost any disinterested personI ask.  However, if even one person disagrees that A is better than B,or if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of A and B,then it is the case that B is better than A for that person, and nothingmore can be said.  I say this is useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajorityseeking to maximise A cannot morally take action against someone seeking tomaximise B (e.g. a terrorist).  To do that would be to claim that a supermajority's carefully considered morality would be better than the terrorist's - which would, of course, be true, but a no-no for an ethicalrelativist.  To claim that ethical relativism implies anything else issimply weasel words, and an example of compartmentalisation to rivalanything in the world of religion.#>#For a similar argument, I sense morality is subjective, it does not#>#hurt me to do things that are considered to be objectively wrong by#>#others.#>#>If you mean that you do things that some others consider objectively#>wrong, and it turns out not to be the case for you - of course this#>is possible.

A few books on the subject have also been mentioned in additionto the one you mentioned.  These may be hard to find, but I think I maytake a stab at it out of curiosity.  I know the one film I saw on thissubject was pretty weak and the only two quotes I have seen which wereused to show science in the Koran (which I posted here) were also pretty vague.  I suspect that these books will extrapolate an awful lot on thequotes they have.At least one poster on the Islam channel seems to have some misgivingsabout the practice of using the Koran to decide what is good science.I wonder if Islam has ever come up with the equivalent of the Christians"Creation Science" on any topic.  It would be interesting to find a historyof scientific interpretations of the Koran, to see if anyone used the Koranto support earlier science which has since been discarded.  It is all tooeasy to look at science as it exists today and then "interpret" passagesto match those findings.  People do similar things with the sayings ofNostradamus all the time.Anyway, it is a rather unique claim of Islam and may be worth checking.

An interesting question would be if atoms> are objects (classical) or phenomenon (neo-quantum) or what?I've been following this train of talk, and the question of dismissing atoms as  being in some sense "not real" leaves me uneasy.It seems to be implied that we obseve only the effects, and therefore the  underlying thing is not necessarily real.  The tree outside my window is in  this category... is observe the light which bounces off of it, not the tree  itself.  The observation is indirect, but no more so than observations I have  made of atoms.Also, what about observations and experiments that have been routinely done  with individual atoms.  I am thinking in particular of atom trapping  experiments and tests of fundamental quantum mechanics such as the quantum Zeno  effect, where an individual atom is studied for a long period of time.Some of the attempts at quantum mechanical arguments were not very satisfying  either.  One has to be carefull about making such arguments without a solid  technical background in the field.  What I read seemed a little confused a  quite a red herring.Anyway, if the purpose of a public debate is to make the audience think, it  worked.  After doing so, I'm willing to try to defend the following assertion  if anyone cares:Atoms are as real as trees, and are real in the ussual every-day sense of the  word "real".

"Reasonable" is an accuracy judgement. #They are not the same thing at all. ("Useful in making some conclusion" is #an accuracy judgement again, I'm afraid.) This is the root of the problem: I bloomin' well amn't punning on theword value!!!  I know it's ambiguous.  I've told you the sense inwhich I'm using it (worth, use, goodness, etc).  And value DOESN'T meanaccuracy, by any stretch of the imagination.  Value=result of a computation,is not what I mean, but I accept it as a possible misinterpretation of'value'.  Value == accuracy comes from out of left field.  I can only understand that by '"useful in making some conclusion" is an accuracyjudgement' you mean one can judge whether it is *really* useful in makingthat conclusion or not.   That's part of what I mean by objectivevaluation - values grounded in solid facts.  One doesn't value x for the purpose y if all the evidence suggests that x doesn't really do that. Therest of what I mean is that the really fundamental values (e.g.  our own freedom) are solid facts in themselves.Consider each of the following statements:(1) The only reason that the distinction between 'accurate' and 'inaccurate' exists at all is that a group of people finds it useful.  (2) The main reason that science exists at all is that a group of peoplefinds the distinction between 'accurate' and 'inaccurate' useful indealing with phenomena.(3) Scientists find simple theories with accurate predictions useful inmodelling phenomena.Where is the 'pun' of which you speak?  Where am I arguing from idiom?  And what is wrong, if those statements are true, with concluding that "the basis of science is its *judged* usefulness in dealing with phenomena, i.e. 'subjective' values"?    After all, what on earth is (3), if not a 'subjective' value judgement?  (an 'accurate' value judgement, maybe?)Just to illustrate what I mean: what's the difference between saying'simple theories with accurate predictions are the best tools we haveto model phenomena' and (say) 'Love and intelligence are the best tools we haveto achieve freedom'?  Is one 'objective', the other not?  Both are judgements about value ("best"), and both have the same empirical basis, from where _I_ sit.#Sorry, Frank, but all you're doing is#using the ambiguity of English to obfuscate the issue. IF you#mean to say that science is based on value (accuracy) judgements,#I have no problem with that. If you mean to say that it's based#on value (goodness) judgements, that's nonsense. By contrast,#morality is clearly based on goodness judgements.I'm afraid I do mean to say that it's based on "goodness" judgements."Simple theories with accurate predictions are better (_better_, BETTER) tools for interpreting reality than complex theories with inaccurate predictions" is a fundamental value judgement that scientists make.  A relativist might say that it only holds in the reference frame of "science", or of a given scientist - but it seems pretty solid and objective to me.-- Frank O'Dwyer                                  'I'm not hatching That'odwyer@sse.ie                                  from "Hens",  by Evelyn Conlon

The concepts of "right"and "wrong" (or "correct/incorrect" or "true/false") belong to thedomain of epistemological rather than moral questions.  It makes nosense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it islegitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivativesof epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation, respectively.One can certainly ask if a percept is "right" (correct, true,veridical) or "wrong" (incorrect, false, illusory).  But it makes littlesense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand, it isstrange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one cancertainly ask that question about motives.Therefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can't be considered:they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.Now the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled:  I agree withthe first part (that the "rightness" of a moral position is ameaningless question), for the reasons stated above.  But that isirrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) thatone cannot feel peace is better than war.  I certainly can makevalue judgments (bad, better, best) without asserting the "correctness"of the position.Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d).  My short (e) answer isthat when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue,neither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect).  They simply holddifferent moral values (feelings).-----------------------------------John A.

Smith.  The introduction is written byPaul Kurtz. Mormonism -- the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints-- claims a worldwide membership 5.2 million.  It is one ofthe world's fastest growing religions, with as many as200,000 new converst in 1982 alone.  Because of the church'saggressive missionary program, covering more than onehundred countries, it is spreading even to third worldcountries.Mormonism is both puritanical in moral outlook andevangelical in preachment.  The church is run along strictauthoritarian lines.  Led by a president, who allegedlyreceives revelations directly form God, and a group oftwelve apostles who attempt to maintain orthodoxy in beliefand practice, the church is opposed to abortion,pornography, sexual freedom, women's rights, and other, inits view, immoral influences of secular society, and itforbids the use of tobacco, alcohol, coffee, and tea.Centered in Salt Lake City, the church is extremely wealthyand politically powerful in Utal and many other westernstates.  Among well-know present-day Mormons are Ezra TaftBenson (former secretary of agriculture), the Osmond family,the Mariotts of the hotel empire, and a score of high-placedgovernment officials.The Mormon church was founded in western New York in 1830 byJoseph Smith who claimed that by divine revelation be hadfound gold plates containing hieroglyphics buried on a hilland that with the help of visits from the angel Moroni hehad been able to translate the writing into the _Book ofMormon_, the basis of Mormon belief.  This book, written "bythe commandment of God," claims that the ancient Hebrewssettled in America about 600 B.C.E. and were the ancestorsof the American Indians.  Mormons believe that those whohave been baptized in the "true church" will be reunitedafter death and that deceased non-Mormon family members canbe baptized by proxy and thus join their relatives in thehereafter.  Because of these beliefs, Mormons have beenconsidered outcasts by mainline Christian denominations andas heretics by religious fundamentalists.Joseph Smith was a controversial figure in his day -- he wasboth worshiped as a saint and denounced as a fraud.  Becauseof persecution he led his band of loyal followers fromPalmyra, New York, westward to Ohio and then to Illinois,where in 1844 he was shot to death by an agry mob.  BrighamYoung, who reportedly had as many as eighty wives, took overthe leadership of the church and led the Mormons furtherwestward, to found the new Zion in Salt Lake City. Following the teachings of Joseph Smith in the practice ofpolygamy was perhaps the Mormons most controversial practicein nineteenth-century America.While other religions go back many centuries --Muhammadanism, 1200 years; Christianity, 2000; and Judaism,3000 -- and attempts to examine their beginnings aredifficult, extensive historical investigation of Mormonroots is possible.  Some Mormons are willing to examine thishistory objectively, bu others maintain that such scrutinyis dangerous to the faith.In the following pages, _Free Inquiry_ presents two articlesabout the Mormon church.  First, George D. Smith, a lifelongmember of the church, provides a detailed criticalexamination of Joseph Smith and his claim the the _Book ofMormon_ was divinely revealed.  Second, we present a portionof an interview with philosopher Sterling McMurrin, also aMormon since birth, who questions the treatment of thehistory of the church by Mormon authorities. -- Paul KurtzThe article itself is super.  ,...,.,, /666;    ',    ////;    _~ -   (/@/----0-~-0 ;'  . `` ~ \\'  , `    ' , >;;|\\..((   -C---->> jimtims p00168@psilink.com ;;| >-  `.__),;;

It sounds as if you are proceeding with justthe sort of obfuscation you have accused me of. I always preceededmy statements with "it is my understanding that..." Now, I have mademy claim clear with regard to the issue of both the Twelve Imams and with Khomeini's supposed claim of infalibility. After hearing yourseemingly more knowledgable claim that Khomeini made no such claimregarding himself, I have withdrawn that portion of my statementregarding that claim. However, I have received _no_ such responseregarding the infallibility of the Twelve Imams. There is nothingobfuscationist about my claims, which are always made clearly. I have received no such clear response regarding the Twelve Imamsbut rather abstruse references to unusual metaphysical natures and other such opaque "concepts" often used by people to camoflage the baselessness of their positions, particularly in matters of theology.These are just the sorts of "concepts" used by Christian churchesthe perverting of their religion. >As salaam a-laikumAlaikum Wassalam,Gregg

If you are surveying our individualphilosophies, fine, but that's not strictly atheism. Atheism is notjust another, godless version of the theistic explanations for life,the universe and everything. It is not a belief system, and it couldhardly be called a philosophical system.Once more: Atheism is characterised by lack of belief in deities. Do not twist the meaning, or assume that we have some kind ofphilosophy we all agree on.Some comments on your questions:> What contact with other atheists have you had; before and after (and during)> your "conversion" to atheism?

This question contains a contradiction in terms. _Beliefs_ cannot be acquired rationally - if they could, they would not be beliefs! You also seem to have rather strange ideas of how people becomeatheists - those who are alienated from religion do not necessarilybecome atheists, they just think very little about religion. It seemsit requires a considerable time of honest inquiry to find out thatreligions are actually intellectually dishonest virtual realities.Those who have never had beliefs will certainly find this questionquite odd - how can lack of belief be acquired?

This question does not make any sense, since atheism does not deal withthese issues - it is not a worldview, or a philosophy, or a belief system.Sigh, why haven't I seen a good, well-thought survey in the Usenetfor three years... and what is the point of doing surveys in the net,anyway?

Quantum mechanics is very differentfrom biochemistry, yet they both (allegedly) have basises in reality.Look, Frank, noone said that people didn't do science because theyvalue it(in the sense of think it is good), but that is not necessaryto make the observation that it's results have value (in the sensethat they are accurate.) Allow me to give you an example: I thinkthat knowing the byte order on IBM 3090s is pretty much worthless(I don't care to know it) but I would be quite prepared tonote as valuable (i.e. accurate) the claim that it was Big-endianif it was shown to be so (like, by showing me the manual.)> And _no-one_ points>out an _unimportant_ difference, _except_ to say that it's unimportant.>"Important", "useful", "worthy", etc. are all words with evaluative>power, quite different from evaluating an expression.

Frank, you are attempting to inject "goodness" judgements where thereare only "accuracy" judgements, by essentially punning on the word'value' which has both meanings. "useful" is a goodness judgement."Reasonable" is an accuracy judgement. They are not the samething at all. ("Useful in making some conclusion" is an accuracyjudgement again, I'm afraid.) Sorry, Frank, but all you're doing isusing the ambiguity of English to obfuscate the issue. IF youmean to say that science is based on value (accuracy) judgements,I have no problem with that. If you mean to say that it's basedon value (goodness) judgements, that's nonsense.

What a miscarriage of philology.I think it may also be worthwhile pointing out that if wetake the appellation `Rabbi' seriously then Jesus had a fullgrasp of contemporary `scripture'Mat21:42 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures...Mat22:29 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowingMat22:29 the scriptures, nor the power of God.Following from this, he would have been in a wonderfulposition to fulfil prophesies, and the NT says as much:Mat26:54 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled,Mat26:54 that thus it must be?Mat26:56 But all this was done, that the scriptures of theMat26:56 prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciplesMat26:56 forsook him, and fled.If the books comprising the referred-to `scripture' had notbeen accessible then it probably would be a differentmatter.--tony

Why should I assert anything about beings that I don't believe in?When I have no good idea of what this being is like, only some contradictory statements being made by various religions, I cannot firmly assert anything specific. A mathematical atheist has a proof that no godlike beings can exist.However, we will first need a definition of 'god', and the theisticreligions do not agree very well on this. Did you see my earlierposting on the existence of god? Theists cannot even agree whetherany god exists, or meta-exists, or is herself the existence. Omnipotence, omnibenevolence and omniscience are other conceptstheists do not all agree upon. Thus, it is hard to assert anythingabout a such fluxional beings. _Deus absconditus_ remains hidden,from those who believe and from those who don't. > That's where weak atheism draws its strength.  But its> strength is also its Achilles' heel.  Without assertions/axioms, one> has no foundation upon which to build.  As a philosophy, it's virtually> worthless.  IMO, of course.I have to disagree here - first, philosophical maxims are not necessarilysomething to build upon. What can I build upon Occam's Razor, for instance? Weak atheism is not a _philosophy_ (a philosophical system).There are several alternatives from which atheists may choose from,ranging from reductionism (my choice) to objectivism. Actually,philosophy becomes simpler without the additional assumption of god/s.Second, your claim that being without assertions is an Achilles'heel of weak atheism sounds strange to me, and is actually a versionof the oft-heard theistic claim that 'but even atheists have to place theirfaith on _something_, even if it is not god_'. This has been discussed inthe FAQ, but from a different viewpoint, and I do not repeat it.I think one does not have to take _anything_ on blind faith.True, one cannot prove that reality exists independent of the observer;to assume this is not a blind leap of faith at all, however. It isprobably the simplest assumption one can make (after solipsism,of course).  Petri-- ___. .'*''.*        Petri Pihko    kem-pmp@          Mathematics is the Truth.!___.'* '.'*' ' .

Lack of belief in God does not directly imply lack of understandingtranscendental values. I hope you would accept the fact that for instance Buddhists appreciate issues related to non-empiricalreasoning without the need to automatically believe in theism.I think reading a couple of books related to Buddhism might revise and fine tune your understanding of non-Christian systems.Cheers,Kent---sandvik@newton.apple.com.

The discussion (on my part atleast) began with Benedikt's questioning of the historical acuuracy ofthe NT. I was making the point that, if the same standards are used tovalidate secular history that are used here to discredit NT history,then virtually nothing is known of the first century.You seem to be saying that the Bible -cannot- be true because itspeaks of the existence of God as it it were a fact.

To what lengths will you go to justify this barbaric behaviour> against Rushdie?Once the Rushdie situation exploded into the media, the Muslim voice onthe matter of the book was effectively restricted to short video bytesshowingthe dramatic highlights of Muslim demonstrations. For every twenty or sonewspaper, magazine articles, interviews etc. supporting Rushdie, therewouldappear one Muslim voice. This person was usually selected based on howdramatic and incoherent he was, not on his knowledge of Islam or thesituation at the time. This approx. twenty to one ratio continuedthroughout the escalation of the crisis, with Rushdie in the centralspotlight as the man of the moment, the valiant defender of everyman'sright to free speech decoupled from responsibility. (As an aside, it'sinteresting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up,some books (defaming certain ethnic and religious groups) continuedto be banned here. It was felt that they injured the sensibilities of thesegroups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of hate towards these groups. For Muslims this kind of double standard was annoying.)Rushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at"organized"Islam, and he did so with admirable verbal skill. The only kind of Islamwhich Rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a "secular" Islam - an Islamseparated from it's Qur'an, it's Prophet, God, its legislation, and mostimportantly from any intrusion into any political arena. Fine - Rushdiemadehis views known - the Muslim's made their anger at his book known. Thescale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions - it was, by thistime,already a political situation - affecting governments as well asindividuals.The situation was a serious one, with far-reaching political implications.At the centre of this turmoil was Rushdie, throwing fuel on the fire -engagedin a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution.Now you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such asthis has no responsibility, has no reason to exercise restraint of anykind, has noobligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight tillmatters calm down. Perhaps you even feel that he is justified in "boldly"defying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literarywork, no matter what insult they find within it. Perhaps you see him asa kind of secular "heroic Knight",mounted on the his media steed, doing battle with the "dragon" of Islamic "fundamentalism".Well Khomeini saw him as a disingeneous author who grew up in a Muslim atmosphere, knew well what Muslim's hold dear, who wrote a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventionsto slander, insult, and attack Islam and its most notable personalities -who, whenfaced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis, continued withhis mischief in the world stage of the media - who, even after people wereinjured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation,continued his mischief, instead of having the good sense to desist.Khomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale, mischiefmaking that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged. The deathsof Muslims around the world and Rushdie's continued media mischiefeven after this, was the triggering factor that seemed todecide Khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief. The person at thecentre of all these events was Rushdie - he was the source of thecontinuing mischief - all media support, government support wasjust that - support. The source was Rushdie (and his publishers, whowere nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happyto see Rushdie constantly in the media). The Islamic rulings thatdeal with people who engage in this kind of grand-scale mischiefmaking, was applied to Rushdie.>You're attempts at justification are not doing the> image of Islam any good.I have made no attempts at justification, only at explanation. "Image" isthe chief concern of Muslim 'apologists' for Islam and for Rushdie.If Muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a sub-culturewithin a larger secular culture, such that the secular principles and lawshad precedence over the laws of Islam - then I have no doubt that Islamwould then be thought to have a good "image" (Principally because it wouldby and large reflect the secular image). A "good image" usually means " bemorelike me".Your attempts at TOTALLY exonerating Rushdie reflect exactly the attitudethatresulted in the polarization brought about by the crisis.>  In Iran, the situation was monitored for many> >months - when Rushdie kept adding fuel to the flames through the free> >worldwide voice that the media gave him, the situation was monitored> >more seriously.

If Rushdie didn't mouth off so much inthemedia, the fuss would have died down - no one would have been killed, nofatwa would have been passed - the whole episode would have fizzled away.

Do let me know>: which... :-)>>A brilliant example of using the introspective objection against >materialist theories of consciousness.Diplomatic :-)I realize I'm fighting Occam's razor in this argument, so I'll try toexplain why I feel a mind is necessary. Firstly, I'm not impressed with the ability of algorithms. They'regreat at solving problems once the method has been worked out, but notat working out the method itself.As a specific example, I like to solve numerical crosswords (not thesimple do-the-sums-and-insert-the-answers type, the hard ones.) To dothese with any efficiency, you need to figure out a variety of tricks.Now, I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles, butin doing so you have to work out the tricks _yourself_, and programthem into the computer. You can, of course, 'obfuscate' the trick, andwrite the program so that it is uncovered, but as far as I can see,the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered. Doesthis mean that all the ideas we will ever have are alreadypre-programmed into our brains? This is somewhat unlikely, given thatour brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of geneticmaterial, much of which isn't used.One way around this is to bring the environment into the equation, but(again, as far as I can see) this still has an air of 'if you seeobject X, then perform action Y,' and we don't seem to get anywhere.The algorithm has to anticipate what it might see, and whatconclusions to draw from it's experience.The other problem with algorithms is their instability. Not manyalgorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code, yetpeople survive strokes without going completely haywire (there areside-effects, but patients still seem remarkably stable.) Also,neurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate -can an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it'scode?The next problem is the sticky question of "What is colour?" (replace'colour' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, thematerialist viewpoint is that it's the product of some kind ofchemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy +different chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these? If this is so, acomputer won't see colour, because the chemistry is different. Does analgorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over anequivalent that doesn't? It shouldn't, because the outputs of eachalgorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances. So why dowe see colour?>>However, such a view is actually a nonsolution. How should minds be>able to act as observers, feel pain and pleasure and issue>commands any better than the brain? Moreover, how do the interactions>occur?A bit of idle speculation...If I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction,with two processes acting on it. The first process has been called'Unitary Evolution' (or 'U'), is governed by Schroedinger's equationand is well known. The second process, called various things such as'collapse of the wavefunction' or 'state vector reduction' (or 'R'),and is more mysterious. It is usually said to occur when a'measurement' takes place, although nobody seems to know preciselywhen that occurs. When it does occur, the effect of R is to abruptlychange the wavefunction.I envisage R as an interaction between the wavefunction and 'somethingelse,' which I shall imaginitively call 'part X.' It seems reasonableto assume that _something_ causes R, although that something might bethe wavefunction itself (in which case, part X is simply thewavefunction. Note, though, that we'd need more than U to explain R.)Anyway, I'm speculating that minds would be in part X. There seems tobe some link between consciousness and R, in that we never see linearsuperpositions of anything, although there are alternativeexplainations for this. I've no idea how a brain is supposed to accesspart X, but since this is only speculation, that won't matter toomuch :-) My main point is that there might be a place for minds inphysics.I'll go back to my nice padded cell now, if that's OK with you :-)>>>Petri-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------Kevin Anthoney                                         kax@cs.nott.ac.uk            Don't believe anything you read in .sig files.------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you say (paraphrased)#in (2) that this is not "evidence for [benefactor]", for example, what you#mean is that it's no *more* evidence for [benefactor] than it is for [bug].Yes, that's what I mean.#In (3), however, you've shifted the meaning of "evidence for [benefactor]"#so that it now means `absolute' "evidence for [benefactor]" rather than#`relative' "evidence for [benefactor]" w.r.t. [bug].Not really, I meant evidence that would tend to one over the other.  Ithink this is just a communications problem.   What I am trying to say,in my clumsy way, is that while I buy your theory as far as it relatesto theism making predictions (prayer, your 'Rapture' example), I don'tbuy your use of Occam's razor in all cases where A=0.In my example, one couldn't dismiss[benefactor] or [bug] on the grounds of simplicity - one of these is necessaryto explain the dosh.  I brought up the 'one-by-one dismissal' process toshow that it would be wrong to do so.  From what you're saying in thispost, it seems you agree, and we're talking at cross-purposes.#(3) is still in contradiction to (1).##Some sums may help. With B = benefactor, b = bug, d = dosh arrives in account:##  (1) implies  P(B+b | d) = 1##Assuming that P(Bb | d) = 0, so it's either the benefactor *or* a bug#which is responsible if the bucks arrive, but not both, then##   P(B+b | d)   =   P(B | d) + P(b | d)##so##   P(B | d) + P(b | d)  =  1##but (3) implies that##   P(B | d)  =  0  and  P(b | d)  =  0.No, this isn't what I meant.  P(B | d) = 0.5 and P(b | d) = 0.5, withnecessarily no new observation (we've already seen the dosh) to changethose estimates.  I was trying to say (again, in my clumsy way) thatit would be _wrong_ to assign 0 probability to either of these.  And that'sprecisely what use of the Razor does in the case of gods - gods areone class of hypothesis (there are many others) belonging to a set ofhypotheses _one_of_which_ is necessary to explain something which otherwise would _not_ be satisfactorily explained.  It can be thrown out orretained on grounds of non-rational preference, not of science or statistics.   Alternatively, one could chuck out or retain the lot, on the groundsthat the answer can't be known, or that the notional probability estimatesare effectively useless, being equal (agnosticism/weak atheism).#> As they do when the set M is filled by "the universe is caused by x",#> where x is gods, pink unicorns, nothing, etc.  - and no observation#> tends to one conclusion over the other.##Exactly the point I was making, I think. So we don't "throw out" any of#these, contrary to your assertion above that we do.Some people do, Simon, and they think they are doing excellent science.My sole point was that they aren't.#>> Only observations which directly contradict the hypothesis H[i] (i.e. x#>> where P(x | H[i]) = 0) can cause P(H[i]) to go to zero after a finite#>> number of observations.

See my post on the other branch of this#thread.Then you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of.  Ifthe razor holds for gods, then it holds for all like hypotheses.  Whichmeans that you're assigning P(x | H[i]) =0 for all i, though we've alreadyestablished that it's not correct to do so when SUM(P(x|H[i]))=1 overall i.#> Simply put, anyone who claims to have a viable proof of the existence or#> non-existence of gods, whether inductive or no, is at best mistaken, and#> at worst barking mad.##Luckily I make no such claim, and have specifically said as much on numerous#occasions. You wouldn't be constructing a strawman here, would you Frank?#Although that doesn't, of course, rule out my being barking mad in any case#(I could be barking mad in my spare time, with apologies to Cleese et al).##But I think you miss the point once again. When I say that something is#"evidence against" an hypothesis, that doesn't imply that observation of#the said something necessarily *falsifies* the hypothesis, reducing the#estimate of P(H | data) to zero. If it *reduces* this quantity, it's still#evidence against H.No, I got that.  I'm talking about the case when A=0.  You're clearlycorrect when A!=0.   And I'm not constructing a strawman (though it'scertainly possible that I've misunderstood what you're saying).  However,by any standards, a system that says when A=0, gods are highly unlikely,and when A!=0 gods can be dismissed using the Razor, is a system purportingto be an inductive proof that gods either don't exist, or are unnecessaryto explain any or all phenomena.  In my experience, systems such as this(including those which purport to prove that gods exist) always containa fallacy upon close examination.  If that's not what you're saying, thenplease put me straight.-- Frank O'Dwyer                                  'I'm not hatching That'odwyer@sse.ie                                  from "Hens",  by Evelyn Conlon

Why do atheists organize in groups?  What is there to discuss?Response:Many things are discussed here, including:* Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one's  family* Prayer in schools* Discrimination against atheists* Sunday trading laws* The Satanic Child Abuse myth* Whether one should be an overt atheist or 'stay in the closet'* How religious societies prey (sic) on new college students* How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers* Whether religion is a danger to society and/or the individual* Why people become atheistsOf course, inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical Christianslooking for someone to convert.  Most readers of the newsgroup don't want to be preached to, although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure from tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings.------------------------------Subject: Hitler was an atheist!Typical posting:Hitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!Response:Adolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist.  As he said himself:   The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in   his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_   superficially_of_God's_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God's_will,_and_   not_let_God's_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]   For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their   abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the   Lord's creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be   active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every   man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who   in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his   religious community and tries to butt into the other.   [...]   Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will   of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_   fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]          -- Adolf Hitler, from "Mein Kampf", trans. Ralph Mannheim.Of course, someone bad believing something does not make that beliefwrong.  It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed to believe in God.  We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist, though.------------------------------Subject: The Bible proves itTypical posting:In the Bible it says that...Response:Most of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionableaccuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who wererecording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn't to say that TheBible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before beingaccepted.Many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage issubject to "interpretation", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing andone thing only is not legitimate.Note that this feeling tends to extend to other books.It is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore otherequally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.------------------------------Subject: Pascal's WagerTypical posting:If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --but if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go tohell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.Response:This argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.Firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there aremany mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is oftendescribed as the "avoiding the wrong hell" problem.  If a person is afollower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.Secondly, the statement that "If you believe in God and turn out to beincorrect, you have lost nothing" is not true.  Suppose you're believing inthe wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine infavour of prayer.Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of comparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly theargument is only likely to convince those who believe already.Also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on evidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or cost-benefit analysis.Formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:  1. One does not know whether God exists.  2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does     exist.  3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.  4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.There are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as anassumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, inthe abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This isconsidered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has noinformation about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial informationcan be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violatesinformation entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, atno "cost".The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  Theproblem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states theChristian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. Theargument thus collapses to "If you are a Christian, it is in your intereststo believe in God" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascalintended the argument to be viewed.The biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God isomniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes asa wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at allwhether people believe in him.------------------------------Subject: What is Occam's Razor?Typical posting:People keep talking about Occam's Razor.  What is it?Response:William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's Razor.  In its original form, it said "Do not multiply entities unnecessarily."  That is, if you can explain something without supposingthe existence of some entity, then do so.Nowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor, they generally express it more generally, for example as "Take the simplest solution".The relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations for what we see around us:1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, whichcame into being as a result of natural processes.2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and there is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be of non-zero complexity.Given that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.Unfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:3. There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.  We just imagine that there is.This third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people find unacceptable. ------------------------------Subject: Why it's good to believe in JesusTypical posting:I want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.Response:Preaching is not appreciated.Feel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings thatare on a "conversion" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism andwill be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgrouptalk.religion.misc).You would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favouritenewsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you wouldhave them do unto you!Often theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthyanalogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know thebasic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tellatheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it,since it tells us nothing we have not been told before.------------------------------Subject: Why I know that God existsTypical posting:I *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.Response:Just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worshipexists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do notexist.  That evidence varies from person to person.Furthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, manypeople have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have beenabducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.------------------------------Subject: Einstein and "God does not play dice"Typical posting:Albert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you're cleverer than him?Response:Einstein did once comment that "God does not play dice [with the universe]". This quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in theChristian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein'srefusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore,Einstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.A better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following:"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony ofwhat exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions ofhuman beings."Einstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in anobjective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to randomevents and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed thatQM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need forstatistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found,and much evidence suggests that it never will be.A longer quote from Einstein appears in "Science, Philosophy, and Religion, ASymposium", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religionin Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  Init he says:  "The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events   the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side   of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him   neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an   independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a   personal God interfering with natural events could never be   *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this   doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific   knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.   But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives   of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine   which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,   will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm   to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers   of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal   God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past   placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they   will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable   of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity   itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably   more worthy task..."Einstein has also said:  "It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,   a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a   personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.   If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the   unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our   science can reveal it."The latter quote is from "Albert Einstein: The Human Side", edited by Helen Dukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.  Also from the same book:  "I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics   to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind    it."Of course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does not in itself imply that Christianity is false.------------------------------Subject: Everyone worships somethingTypical posting:Everyone worships something, whether it's money, power or God.Response:If that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much aboutthose things that atheists care about.  If the atheists' reactions to (forexample) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.------------------------------Subject: Why there must be a causeless causeTypical posting:Sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, sochains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.Response:The set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but hasno smallest member.Further, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that doesnot imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, andespecially not that any such entity must match the description favoured byany particular religion.------------------------------Subject: The universe is so complex it must have been designedTypical posting:The presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely youdon't think all this appeared here just by chance?Response:This is known as the Argument From Design.It is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in theuniverse. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of livingcreatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read thenewsgroup talk.origins for a while.There is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here.However, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour ofso-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence,observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of theuniverse and life on earth.The origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence ofsomething as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable thatsurely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaosdeliberately.But if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mindcapable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings mustbe immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of theexistence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationistposition.This leads us to the familiar theme of "If a creator created the universe,what created the creator?", but with the addition of spiralling improbability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was notcreated and just "is" (or "was").From here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universejust "is" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book"A Brief History of Time", explains his theory that the universe is closedand finite in extent, with no beginning or end.The Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called Watchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch onthe beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that itevolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the watch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the universe too must have a creator.The Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above those common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates watches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have created the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are clearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.Secondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in the world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear reactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument would therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a different part of creation.Finally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore stands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the argument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not random, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus internally inconsistent.------------------------------Subject: Independent evidence that the Bible is trueTypical posting:The events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentaryevidence.  For example...Response:The writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentaryevidence.Early versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus orJames; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Manyscholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, butthat this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several "reconstructions" ofthe original text have been published to this effect.Much information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320C.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberatefalsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'thefirst thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' It is Eusebius who isgenerally given the title of authorship for this material.Aside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus ismore well-documented.  For further information, please consult the FrequentlyAsked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.------------------------------Subject: Godel's Incompleteness TheoremTypical posting:Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for theBible to be both true and complete.Response:Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary arithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be valid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system.  (Technicallyspeaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decisionprocedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal system.)Essentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a "Liar Paradox."  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is "This sentence is false."  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.The logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claimsthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible toprove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.One can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove theexistence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom. This is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.It may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axiomsthat both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to showthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, thatwould still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God existswithin the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything aboutwhether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.Note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing aboutthe actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.Another frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstratesthat a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot beboth consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formalsystems, so such claims are nonsense.------------------------------Subject: George Bush on atheism and patriotismTypical posting:Did George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?Response:The following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I.Sherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Shermanis a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member ofthe press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announcefederal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to thepresidential primary: RS: "What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?" GB: "I guess I'm pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in      God is important to me." RS: "Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of      Americans who are atheists?" GB: "No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens,      nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under      God." RS: "Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation      of state and church?" GB: "Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I'm just not      very high on atheists."UPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations werestill angry over the remarks.The exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27,1989.  It can also be found in "Free Enquiry" magazine, Fall 1988 issue,Volume 8, Number 4, page 16.On October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane,cochairman of the Bush-Quayle '88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned alawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated SchoolDistrict 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son topledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as "one nation under God"(Bush's phrase).  The following conversation took place:  RS: "American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.      Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?"  EM: "It's bullshit."  RS: "What is bullshit?"  EM: "Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit."  RS: "Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush      campaign is on this issue." EM: "You're welcome."After Bush's election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retracthis statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to thePresident, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood byhis original statement, and wrote:  "As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports   atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or   supported by the government."For further information, contact American Atheist Veterans at the AmericanAtheist Press's Cameron Road address.------------------------------Subject: I know where hell is!Typical posting:I know where Hell is!  Hell is in Norway!Response:There are several towns called "Hell" in various countries around theworld, including Norway and the USA.  Whilst this information is mildlyamusing the first time one hears it, readers of alt.atheism are now getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.------------------------------Subject: Biblical contradictions wantedTypical posting:Does anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions?Response: American Atheist Press publish an atheist's handbook detailing Biblicalcontradictions. See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources fordetails.There is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from thearchive-server@mantis.co.uk. See the contacts file for more information.------------------------------Subject: The USA is a Christian nationTypical posting:Because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn't theUnited States be considered a Christian nation?Response:Based upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clearthat they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.  Here are somequotes; there are many more.  "What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?   In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the   ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen   upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been   the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert   the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient   auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it,   needs them not."      - James Madison, "A Memorial and Remonstrance", 1785  "I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of   the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved--the Cross.   Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!"      - John Adams, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson  "History I believe furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people   maintaining a free civil government.  This marks the lowest grade of   ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will   always avail themselves for their own purpose."      - Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt, 1813  "I cannot conceive otherwise than that He, the Infinite Father, expects or   requires no worship or praise from us, but that He is even infinitely   above it."      - Benjamin Franklin, from "Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion",        Nov. 20, 1728------------------------------Subject: The USA is not a Christian nationTypical posting:Is it true that George Washington said that the United States is not in anysense founded upon the Christian religion?Response:No.  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treatyof Tripoli (8 Stat 154, Treaty Series 358):   Article 11   As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense   founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of   enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, -- and as   the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility   against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no   pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption   of the harmony existing between the two countries.The text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collectionssuch as Charles Bevans' "Treaties and Other International Agreements of theUnited States of America 1776-1949", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).The English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate onJune 7, 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  It wasrecently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks thequotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.The person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, ConsulGeneral at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent ofChristianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since thereis no Arabic version of that article to be found, it's hard to say.In 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained thequotation.End of FAQ Digest*****************

The following is a survey directed towards all readers of thisgroup, intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief.  I wouldseriously appreciate it if each and every one of you would fill it out andmail it back to me at mtabbott@unix.amherst.edu.  First of all, I've tried to structure questions that can be answered in avariety of ways, with varying amounts of detail; it's possible to give succinct answers to most everything, but there's enough here to keep most of you typing for hours, I'm sure.  As much detail as you want to give me (I mean it) is great, but it's also important for me to have as broad a base of individuals as possible, so even minimal responses are far better than nothing-- it's a short survey if you just answer the questions without elaboration.  Secondly, I hope some of the questions don't come off as obnoxious; I know thatphrases like "What would convince you of the existence of God" imply that I ama seminary student intent on proving you all to be ignorant Godless heathens.In fact, I'm not too sure about the existence of a higher power myself, so myuse of "God" is a question of locution rather than ideology -- it's easier than just repeating "a deity or higher power" every time.  Also, I tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like "belief system"although I know some of you might contend that you don't have ANY beliefs, butare skeptical towards everything.  I understand; but you know what I mean.Think of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases required to get the precise idea across.  Lastly, thanks!  Please fill out as much as you can, in as much detail asyou can, and send them to me.  My research and I thank you.  ---------------Where would you place your beliefs, on the spectrum Theism <--> Agnosticism <--> Weak Atheism <--> Strong Atheism?  Feel free to elaborate on your specific beliefs.  In what, if any, religious tradition were you raised?  Did you ever believe in the existence of a God?  (Several of the following questions presume that the answer to this is "yes;" if you've always been an atheist, or atleast never a theist, you may have to modify the question/answer somewhat.)How serious was your/your family's involvement?  How and when did you start to doubt the tenets you were raised to believe?  How and when did your "final break" with your beliefs, if any, occur?  I realize that this is often more of an ongoing process than an "event" per se;whatever the case, just describe it in whatever detail you wish.  What contact with other atheists have you had; before and after (and during)your "conversion" to atheism?  (Certainly your involvement with alt.atheismcounts -- how have net discussions affected your beliefs?)  To what extent do you think other atheists have influenced you in yourbeliefs?  Did you come by your beliefs through discussion, throughindependent means, or by some combination of the two or other means?  Are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rationalmeans (proofs of the non-existence of God, etc), or was it perhaps, at least in part, through other means (alienation from mainstream religion, etc)?  To what extent do you feel you "understand" the universe through your beliefs?What phenomena of the universe and of human existence (anything from physicalphenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs) do you feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs, and where are they lacking as an explanatory method?  What would it take for you to question, or change, your beliefs?  What wouldconvince you of the existence of God, what would convince you of the plausibility of God's existence, and so forth?  How dynamic are your beliefs-- are they constantly changing; have they stayed more or less the same forsome time?  Are you involved in a career or education in science?  To what extent do youthink science has influenced your beliefs?  (Issac Asimov claimed that sciencewas the new "secular religion," and that "scientists are, in a very real sense,the new priesthood."  Do you see the pursuit of science as having a quasi-religious base, or even a religious element?)  ---------------This survey is intended to get data from a broad range of individuals, butalso to help me narrow down the field to a small group of people whoseideas and histories could be very useful to me.  Would you be willing to haveme, on the basis of this survey, write you to find out more about you and yourbeliefs?  If not, fine; your filling out the survey alone is great.  ---------------Thanks again.  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about whatI'm doing with this data, or if you have anything to say in addition to whatI've asked about above.  Mark Abbottmtabbott@unix.amherst.ed

King (king@ctron.com) posts a whopping one liner: * "The modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be * *  treated as a matter of faith." -- Francis Hitching                     *  I have a few points to make about the above posting.    1. Science is not based on and does not consist of "quotes" from either    real or alleged experts.  Critical reasoning, evidence and (if possible)    experimentation are necessary.  Creationists frequently display a massive    confusion about this by merely quoting both non-experts and experts alike    (some of the latter quotes are in fact false) and steadfastly refusing to    follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure.  This strongly suggests    that (a.) their claims completely lack any scientific merit and (b.) they    are aware of this fatal deficiency.  Of course, you may not actually be a    creationist and this may not be your real intent.    2. You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his    statement.  Why is that?  If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the    quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology.    Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context    and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate    scientists.  Of course, you may not actually be a creationist and this may    not be your real intent.    3. Evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of "the modern theory of    evolution" would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one    line quote from an unidentified nobody.  It is also important to note that    disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate    claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck    proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid.  Creationists seem rather fond    of diving (head first) into this logical fallacy.  Of course, you may not    actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent.    4. Since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science, an attack    on evolution (either the fact or the theory) really represents an attack on    science.  While the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve (B^) the    fact of evolution will not ever go away.  Creationists lost the battle long    ago (more than 100 years in fact) but are simply too willfully ignorant and    irrational to acknowledge the fact.  Of course, you may not actually be a    creationist and you may not really be that ignorant.Warren Kurt vonRoeschlaub (kv07@IASTATE.EDU) asks: * Neither I, nor Webster's has ever heard of Francis Hitchings.  Who is he? *  I, like Hitchings, am not to be found in Webster's B^).  Francis Hitchingsis a scientifically illiterate creationist (or perhaps he is just playing thepart of one) who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution ("The Neck ofthe Giraffe").  In that publication he quotes a creationist (Jean Sloat Morton)using the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins couldnot have formed by chance.  Thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution(the two are quite independent) but also concluding with a "non sequitur" (i.e.the conclusion "does not follow"). [pp 70-71]  Hitchings also misquotes RichardLewontin in an effort to support creationism. [pp 84]  Hitchings book was reviewed by National Park Service ecologist David Graberin the Los Angeles Times (and repeated in the Oregonian).  The article wastitled "`Giraffe' sticks scientific neck out too far".  Excerpts include :  "Francis Hitchings is not a biologist."  "He goes after Darwin like Mark  Antony after Brutus.  He flips from scientific reasoning to mysticism and  pseudo-science with the sinuosity of a snake-oil salesman."  "He suggests  a mystical `organizing principle' of life, using the similarity of organs  in different creatures as evidence [sic]."  Note that the last statement above is actually evidence FOR evolution notagainst it.  If John E. King is quoting from this reviewed book it wouldn'tsurprise me much.  It's also interesting that King had nothing to add (i.e.he only posted a quote).

Thefacts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians in any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostlyto the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniqueswhich were technically possible only recently.The idea that "hundreds of thousands" of Iraqi citizens died isludicrous.  Not even "hundreds of thousands" of Iraqi soldiers died,and they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the USand its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians?Either the smart bombs didn't hit their targets (and we know they did),or they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive todestroying Iraq's military potential.  The military mission planners arenot fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war.Hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you,not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against theirtyrant-dictator. > > OK, so some innocent people died.

War is never an exact science, butwith smart bombs, it's becoming more exact with a smaller percentageof civilian casualties.  Sometimes mistakes are made; targets aremisidentified; innocents die.  That's war the way it really is.But the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earthlike it's one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get isworse.  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago, "I know not whatcourse others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give medeath!"

I'm sure that appeasement would haveworked better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I guess weshouldn't have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocentGerman civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor French who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  We should have just let Hitler take over Europe, and you'd be speakingGerman instead of English right now.Tyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped.  His kind don't understanddiplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret isthat Bush wimped out and didn't have the military roll into Baghdad, sonow Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people's sacrifice (not tomention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait was a good thing, but wiping Hussein off the map would've been better!And as for poor, poor Rodney King!  Did you ever stop and think *why*the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of "not guilty"?Those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of thosepolicemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape.But the jury looked at *all* the evidence, evidence which you and Ihave not seen.  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of atrial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simplylowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mindwhich your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tendsto support in the case against the policemen.  Law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused,whether they be criminals or cops.  One is not found guilty if there isa reasonable doubt of one's guilt, and only the jury is in a positionto assess the evidence and render a verdict.

Apparently the idea is to poke fun at religion, but there is presumably some sort of reasoning behind it. As an argument, this statement is worthless. Presuming the Qur'an is a perfect religious text (whatever that might be) there is still plenty of room for disagreement about its implications for issues far from essentials.I've already responded to the question of how a judgment might be madebetween two people who in fact _do_ disagree about Islam, which doesn'tpresume anything about the Qur'an other than its having sufficientclarity for all important disputes about the basic principles ofIslam. This hardly constitutes a claim that no two people could havedisagreements about _all_ issues relevant to Islam.Gregg

Bill, you seem to have erroneously assumed that this board has as itssole purpose the validation of atheism.  It doesn't.  This board isused to discuss atheism as a philosophy, to share posters' experiencesregarding atheism, to debunk various theisms and theism as a whole, toshare resources relating to atheism, and even to socialize with otherswith similar views.  And of course with the number of theists who comehere to preach, it is also used to argue the case for atheism. >           At no time have I made any statement that religion was the> sole cause of anything, what I have done is point out that those who> do make that kind of claim are mistaken, usually deliberately.

Both of these claim to make their followersinto good people, and claim that much of benefit to humanity has beenaccomplished through their faiths.  IMHO they are right.  The AmericanFriends Service Committee (Quaker), Catholic Relief Services, BreadFor The World, Salvation Army soup kitchens, and Mother Theresa springto mind.  (Can someone with more knowledge of Islam supply the namesof some analagous Islamic groups?)  When Mother Theresa claims that her work is an outgrowth of herChristianity, I believe her.  Her form of theism ascribes to her deitysuch a benevolence toward humanity that it would be wrong not to carefor those in need.  The point is that such a philosophy does have thepower to change the behavior of individuals;  if it is widespreadenough, it can change societies.The same works for the horrors of history.  To claim that Christianityhad little to do with the Crusades or the Inquisition is to deny theawesome power that comes from faith in an absolute.  What it seems youare doing twisting the reasonable statement that religion was neverthe solitary cause of any evil into the unreasonable statement thatreligion has had no evil impacts on history.  That is absurd. -- Scott Sauyet            ssauyet@eagle.wesleyan.edu

In addition, people often request information which hasbeen posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, thealt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the followingtitles:   1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers   2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism   3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)   4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument   5.

Theothers are entirely optional.If you are new to Usenet, you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroupnews.announce.newusers.  The articles titled "A Primer on How to Work Withthe Usenet Community", "Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet"and "Hints on writing style for Usenet" are particularly relevant.  Questionsconcerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions.If you are unable to find any of the articles listed above, see the "FindingStuff" section below.

Truly free.  You may copy them and distribute themto anyone you wish.  However, please send any changes or corrections to theauthor, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; itdoes nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floatingaround the network.                                Finding StuffAll of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here aresome suggestions on what to do if you can't find them:1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with   "Alt.Atheism FAQ:".2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.   If you don't find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn't set up   correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the   problem.3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.70.0.226].   Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you'll find the latest   versions of the FAQ files there.   FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you   need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to   mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with      send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq   in the body.4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article   "Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup" carries a list of these   sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.5. If you don't have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu   consisting of the following lines:      send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources      send usenet/alt.atheism/faq      send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction      send usenet/alt.atheism/logic      send usenet/alt.atheism/resources5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of   the following lines:      send atheism/faq/faq.txt      send atheism/faq/logic.txt      send atheism/faq/intro.txt      send atheism/faq/resource.txt   and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.   There's other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are "help" and   "send atheism/index".6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this   if you've tried the above methods and they've failed; it's not nice to   clutter the newsgroup or people's mailboxes with requests for files.   it's better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,   people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don't have    FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files.mathew

I would think that would be great _fun_, not having everfelt the joy and peace the Christians speak of with a longing gaze.This is not what I got when I believed - I just tried to hide my fearof getting punished for something I never was sure of.

In fact, it is amusing to note in thiscontext that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly theopposite - one should not examine one's belief critically.I'll tell you something I left out of my 'testimony' I posted to thisgroup two months ago. A day after I finally found out my faith is over,I decided to try just one more time. The same cycle of emotionalresponses fired once again, but this time the delusion lasted onlya couple of hours. I told my friend in a phone that it really works,thank god, just to think about it again when I hung up. I had to admitthat I had lied, and fallen prey to the same illusion.> No one asks you to swallow everything, in fact Jesus warns against it.   But let> me ask you a question.

I learned what it means to use _reason_.As a student of chemistry, I had to perform a qualitative analysisof a mixture of two organic compounds in the lab. I _hated_ experimentslike this - they are old-fashioned and increase the student's workloadconsiderably. Besides, I had to do it twice, since I failed in my firstattempt. However, I think I'll never forget the lesson: No matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is X,it may still be Y. It is _very_ tempting to jump into conclusions, takea leap of faith, assure oneself, ignore the data which is inconsistent. But it can still be wrong. I found out that I was, after all, using exactly the same mechanismto believe in god - mental self-assurance, suspension of fear, filtering of information. In other words, it was only me, no godplaying any part. > The life , death, and resurection of Christ is documented historical fact.Oh? And I had better believe this? Dan, many UFO stories are much betterdocumented than the resurrection of Jesus. The resurrection is documentedquite haphazardly in the Bible - it seems the authors did not pay toomuch attention to which wild rumour to leave out. Besides, the ends ofthe gospels probably contain later additions and insertions; for instance,the end of Mark (16:9-20) is missing from many early texts, says my Bible.Jesus may have lived and died, but he was probably misunderstood.> As much> as anything else you learn.

Those who do are usually rememberedas heroes, at least among those who believe. Dan, do you think I'mlying when I say I believed firmly for 15 years? It seems it is very difficult to admit that someone who has really believed does notdo so anymore. But I can't go on lying to myself.Blind trust is dangerous, and I was just another blind led by the blind.But if god really wants me, she'll know what to do. I'm willing. I justdon't know whether she exists - looking at the available evidence,it looks like she doesn't.

How true. This claim wouldlend substantial support to the notion that religions are actuallyseamless virtual realities.Does god exist or not? To us, this question is a true dichotomy.Can god know a reason for her existence? If she is omniscient, thenshe must know this. There is a philosophical problem whether anythingcan exist without a time frame - for instance, if it were possible toobserve our universe from 'outside', in the neverness surroundingthis universe, it would never have existed. Thus, we are faced with a trilemma:1) God 'meta-exists', and from this meta-existing perspective shecreated existence, the Universe and everything. This implies that the universe was not actually formed of nothing, whichis precisely what many theories of cosmogenesis (Lizhi & Shuxian: Creation of the Universe) say. This 'nothingness' is not empty enough,it is not the transcendental nothingness where there is no existence,until (there is no 'when' yet, but never mind) god, the source ofall existence, started to play. I fail to see the difference betweenthese two forms of nothingness, though. If there isn't one, it mightbe god is not necessary for creation.It is obvious that the levels of 'meta-existence' are not necessarilylimited to god, there might be a 'meta-god' on some other level.2) God exists, and has always existed (she has a timescale, whichis different from our own). This sounds sensible, but it is difficultto conceive how she could know why she exists - a being whichhas always existed, and is infinitely conscious of itself, canremember that she has always been the same, and perhaps know herselfcompletely, but she cannot know why she exists, and how she knowseverything she knows. Would a knowledge of how a being with a personality (a subjective viewpoint) knows everything be thisbeing's knowledge? A conscious being conscious of everything isactually a contradiction in terms - it means that god is onlyconscious of herself, since we, and the whole universe, arealready incorporated in her mental models, thoroughly modelled.Actually, a conscious being conscious of only itself is notconscious at all. 3) God is herself the Existence. This is nothing more than an Orwellianredefinition of the word existence. A logical consequence of thisstatement is that god is actually _all_ existence. I think this isalso called a form of pantheism.: If this: being declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has: defined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed,: He is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically: self-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an: objective sense.In a reality god is supposed to have created, I cannot believe inher, is that my fault or the creator's fault? God gave me freedomof choice, but nevertheless knows what I will opt for, is it fairplay on her side?If god has a conscious mind, in any sense, she has a point of view.I'd say she is entitled to her opinions about me, but I still insistthat any harm she might attempt to do to me will be met with resistance and disapproval. : If God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective.No, an objective standard means something independent on _any_subjective viewpoint, _including_ god's point of view. : If human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that: standard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative: morality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous,: meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to: misunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to: meet that standard is therefore objectively determined.What standard? My morality (and my conscience)  disagrees with the'standards' of the Bible. Which one to ignore? How to interpretany divine standard? There is a great discrepancy even among Christians on this. For instance, the Bible does not condemnfemale homosexuality - why many Christians do, thinking god doesn'taccept it anyway?Bill, to reject a concept of any objective morality does not make theterm nebulous. Morality is the subjective aspect of societal behaviour,something we can change, and something that _must_ change whensocieties change. It might be some basic concepts are hard-wiredin our brains by evolution, but in the end, we must decide ourselves.I don't think people need religion to keep them moral; thinking goes beyond threat of punishment. : Just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is: infinitely malleable, doesn't mean that the objective standard itself: doesn't exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural: norm, or the preferred conduct of "decent" people, making it seem: subjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard.I've yet to see an objective standard that is a) universally applicable (today and tomorrow)b) universally acceptable (not against our own concepts of what ismoral and what isn't): Ironically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true: nature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being: contrary to human nre, oppressive and severe. This may be due as: much to our amoral inclinations as to the standard itself, but like it: or not, it's there.I don't think Christian morality is of a particularly high standard,although it is probably a reflection of high morals of the time,and much of it is still applicable. The problem is that I can'tagree with it all. This is not a question of comforting myconscience with a thought that "I won't be responsible with whatI do", as Christians would put it. My conscience is in an irreconcilableconflict with the Bible on homosexuality, Paul's idea of women'srole in marriage etc... and the whole idea that I should believein someone I got no help from in this task.Petri-- ___. .'*''.*        Petri Pihko    kem-pmp@          Mathematics is the Truth.!___.'* '.'*' ' .

Doesn't sound good to me, stifles progress.Yup.  This is me.  I don't know why it crossposted.  I was accessing nn from another system and that might have caused the glitch.I hold that an objective moral system exists regardless of my knowledge or application of it.  I relate it to the idea that there is scientific truth that is truth even though I may not know about it.  Some morals I wouldn't want to change, and would not consider it progress fora society to oneday say that rape and murder are ok.  Some underlying themes (morality, honesty, courage, respect, etc.) are used to base actions.  I don't consider the idea that we should have been moral, should be moral now, and should be so in the future a limitation, when it includes such morality.  Aberrances in a moral system, i.e. it is immoral to marrysomeone of the opposite sex, it is immoral to listen to rock and roll, etc. seem to be different than the above lists, and if specific actions are givenmoral status I tend to question those morals.MAC >-- >  Disclaimer?

A much more likely explanationis the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, becausethe sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not thehistorical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitationimages of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk ofthe clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of coursenot.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether theanti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, orbecause it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.  The use of anti-Sunto represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented,but I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now.-- Diccon Frankborn (dickeney@access.digex.com)

I purposely used "handle" in order to avoid doing so - i.e., that happens to be what religions do (of course there areaberrations like "scientific" creationism).  I used "best" in part to indicate that science currently has a time of it with why and who, so these domains aremostly ignored.  I also attempted to be brief, which no doubt confused thematter.  As an aside, for science I should have written "how and when".  Nobodyseems to argue over what.>Are they [theists, theologians] any better equiped to investigate the "who and >why" than magicians, astrologers, housewives [not being sexists], athiests or >agnostics.Seems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual.  I'm nottrying to be evasive on this, but from a societal perspective, religion works.On the other hand, sometimes it is abused and misused, and many suffer, whichyou know.  But the net result seems positive, this from the anthropologicalperspective on human affairs.  You might call me a neo-Fruedian insofar as I think the masses can't get along without religion.  Not that generally they are incapable; they just don't, and for myriad reasons, but the main one seems to be the promise of immortality.  Very seductive, that immortality.  Therefore it seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for dispensing answers to "who and why".  I suggest that this holds regardless of the "truth" in their answers to who and why simply because people believe.  In the end, spiritual beliefs are just as "real" as scientific facts and explanation (CAUTION TO SOME: DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT).  >Do you suggest that the "who and why" will forever be closed to scientific >investigation?No.  In fact, I don't think it is closed now, at least for some individuals. Isn't there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was created from nothing in a Big Bang singularity?  This approach might presuppose an absence of who and why, except that it seems it could be argued that something had to be responsible for nothing?  Maybe that something doesn'thave to be supernatural, maybe just mechanistic.  But that's a tough one forpeople today to grasp.  In any case, theory without empirical data is not explanation, but then your question does not require data.  In other words, I agree that theorizing (within scientific parameters) is just as scientific as explaining.  So the answer is, who and why are not closed to scientists, but I sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate.  Data will be necessary for improvement, and that seems a long way off, if ever.  Pretty convoluted here; I hope I've made sense.  >It seems to me that 200 or so years ago, the question of the origin of life on>earth was not considered open to scientific enquiry.I agree generally.  But I prefer to put it this way - the *questions* of how, when, who and why were not open to inquiry.  During the Enlightenment, reason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when, and not, for the most part, who and why.  Science was thus born out of the naturalists' curiosity, eventually carting away the how and when while largely leaving behind the who and why.  The ignorant, the selfish, the intolerant, andthe arrogant, of course, still claim authority in all four domains.>|>Rich Fox, Anthro, Usouthdakota>Did like your discussion around AMHs, and I did figure out what AMH was from>your original post :-)Much obliged.

So the math says that nothing can enter a black hole.It seems to me that you are mis-using physical intuition here.  My point isthat you are talking about global conditions influencing local phenomenainappropriately.  Remember that there is no such thing as a "global" frameof reference for time.  Our minds like to pretend that there is, and we imagine things like the calendar on Alpha Centaury being approx. 4 years off from ours on Earth.This is simply wrong.  There is NO global "time" which can be applied toevents on Alpha Centaury concurrently with events on Earth.  This is whatSpecial Relativity has taught us.  If I am travelling past the Earth ata high rate of speed toward A.C. I can even have a different view of the _order_ of the occurance of events on A.C. versus Earth.  Thus, the answer to the question, "what's happening on Alpha Centaury NOW?" is NOT well-defined, ifasked on Earth, until you specify all the relevant parameters such as relativevelocities and the like; AND it will have different answers for different values of these parameters.Now, in the vicinity of a black hole, the curvature of spacetime becomes important enough that this lack of a global frame of reference becomes very important.  In particular, the frame used by a distant observer is quite different from the frame appropriate to the falling object.  Our minds just don't seem able to easily deal with the idea that time itself could be behaving differently in these two locations, but the equations of relativity say that it does.  We would _like_ to say "the falling object is hoveringabove the horizon, NOW", for an object whose frame has rotated wholly "away"from ours.  In a very real sense, once the object has fallen into the holeits gone forever from our ken.  Unless you volunteer to jump in after it,that is... :-) Gene Battin battin@cyclops.iucf.indiana.edu no .sig yet

There are enormous quantities ofdetailed arguments against Christianity, many of the arguments still being usedtoday.  Despite volumes of tracts attacking Christianity, not one denies theexistance of Jesus, only of his activities.

If what was being discussed could be established or disproven by experiment and observation, then I would agree with you, Chris.  The burden of proof would belong to Bill. But the sourcedocument for Christianity, the Bible, simply assumes God existsand makes it clear (to us Calvinists, anyway :-)) that when a personis in fellowship with God, it is because God has taken the initiativein revealing Himself to that person. So from a Christian point ofview, the burden of proof belongs to God.

All of the writers musthave received their information from the early Christians,perhaps second or third hand.  None of these references give anyhint that the writers had any independent information aboutJesus. These references do show that the early Christians were having aninfluence, at least enough to earn a few lines here and there inother peoples' writings.

A short, positive assertion would be nice.As I hope you can tell, (b) and (c) are actually predicated onthe assumption that values are real  - so statements like these_can't_ consistently derive from the relativist assumption that valuesaren't part of objective reality.  -- Frank O'Dwyer                                  'I'm not hatching That'odwyer@sse.ie                                  from "Hens",  by Evelyn Conlon

Well, the best thing to do is to read the book "Parallel Universes"by Dr. Fred Wolf. In essence, Dr. Wolf says that one interpretation of the sub-atomicparticle/wave duality is that what we perceive as a wave is actuallyan infinate number of parallel universes overlaid, and in each ofthese universes there is a particle in a different location. When wedo something to make a particle "appear," we are actually causingall the parallel universes to collapse into one. Apparently this isone line of thought on the nature of QM, that is going through someof the scientific community.Dr. Wolf (and many others) claim that somehow the collapse is causedby the mental effort of observing the particle. This implys thatmind is more than merely a biological phenomenon. He then extrapolatesthat if mind is an integral part of the universe, then perhaps consciousnessis the element that gives order and form to the universe(s) it/themself(s).It all gets rather interesting, but what I find facinating is thatthis would explain the phenomenon of "magick" as practiced in myreligion. Dr. Wolf speculates that the ordering functionality of mindcould be caused by the selection of a future from an infinite number ofpossible futures; he says that this might be done by some sort ofcommunication between ones current, and possible future selves. I have long speculated that if magick is not merely a form of selfdelusion then perhaps it could be caused by some sort of a selectionof one of many possible futures.I realize that this gets pretty bizarre, but it never hurts to keep an open mind and at least file it all away as another possibile explaination of the world in which we find ourselves. After all, themore we learn about the universe in which we live, the more we learnthat it is truly a very strange place.>Nancieric

Who is he? >Please do not answer with "A well known evolutionist" or some other such>informationless phrase.   Francis Hitching is the author of, among other books,_The Neck of the Giraffe_." He believes evolution isdirected by some sort of cosmic force, but does not likeDarwinism.  He wrote in this book [ _The Neck of theGiraffe_, Ticknor & Fields, New Haven, Connecticut, 1982,p. 12 (p. 4, paperback)] that:   For all its acceptance in the scientific world as the   great unifying principle of biology, Darwinism, after   a century and a quarter, is in a surprising amount of   trouble.  Evolution and Darwinism are often taken to   mean the same thing.  But they don't.  Evolution of   life over a very long period of time is a fact, if we   are to believe evidence gathered during the last two   centuries from geology, paleontology, molecular biol-   ogy and many other scientific disciplines.  Despite   the many believers in Divine creation who dispute this   ..., the probability that evolution has occurred   approaches certainty in scientific terms....  On the   other hand Darwinism (or neo-Darwinism, its modern   version) is a theory that seeks to explain evolution.   It has not, contrary to general belief, and despite   very great efforts, been proved.   Research on Hitching turned up the following: Hitching isbasically a sensational TV script writer and has no scien-tific credentials.  In _The Neck of the Giraffe_ he claimedto be a member of the Royal Archaeological Institute, but aninquiry to that institute said he was not.  He implied inthe "Acknowledgements" of _The Neck of the Giraffe_ thatpaleontologist Stephen Jay Gould had helped in the writingof the book, but upon inquiry Gould said he did not know himand had no information about him.  Hitching also impliedthat his book had been endorsed by Richard Dawkins, but uponinquiry Dawkins stated: "I know nothing at all about FrancisHitching.  If you are uncovering the fact that he is a char-latan, good for you.  His book, _The Neck of the Giraffe,_is one of the silliest and most ignorant I have read foryears."   Hitching believes in the paranormal and has written onMayan pyramid energy and for some "In Search Of..." episodeson BBC television.  The reference work _ContemporaryAuthors,_ Vol. 103, page 208, lists him as a member of theSociety for Psychical Research, the British Society ofDowsers and of the American Society of Dowsers.  His writ-ings include: _Earth Magic,_ _Dowsing: The Psi Connection,__Mysterious World: An Atlas of the Unexplained,_ _Fraud,Mischief, and the Supernatural_ and _Instead of Darwin_.   Hitching's book spends much of its time attacking Dar-winian evolution, borrowing heavily and uncritically fromyoung-earth creationist arguments.  Many of Hitching's "ref-erences" are lifted from young-earth creationist literaturerather than being quoted directly from their originalsources.  One magazine had this to say [_Creation/EvolutionNewsletter_, 7, No. 5, pp. 15-16, September/October 1987]:   Speaking of the Biblical Creation Society, there was   an interesting letter in the January 1983 issue of   their journal Biblical Creation (p. 74) concerning a   review of Francis Hitching's 1982 book _The Neck of   the Giraffe_.  Hitching's book is strongly anti-   Darwinist, and is enthusiastically hailed by most cre-   ationists (though he also pokes fun at fundamentalist   creationists).  The letter, by creationist Malcolm   Bowden (author of _The Rise of the Evolution Fraud_),   points out that Hitching simply "culled his informa-   tion from the creationist literature."  This is indeed   the case:  many creationist works are cited favorably   (Anderson, Coffin, Clark, Daly, Davidheiser, Dewar,   Gish, Morris, Segraves, Whitcomb, and Wysong, plus   various anti-Darwinists).  Hitching does cite Bowden's   earlier book _Ape-Men -- Fact or Fallacy?_, but Bowden   accuses Hitching of "lifting" several passages and   illustrations from his book without acknowledgment:   in other words, plagiarism.  "Hitchin's [sic] book is   largely an exposition of the creationists [sic] view-   point from the beginning to almost the end," Bowden   points out....  Hitching is also a paranormalist, an   advocate of psychic evolution.... [Hitching's book]   _Earth Magic_ is a wild, extremely entertaining and   thoroughly psychic interpretation of megalithic struc-   tures....  Hitching also includes in his scheme cosmic   cataclysms, Atlantis, pyramidology, dowsing, ESP,   miraculous healing, and astrology.-------------------------------------------------------Alan Feuerbacheralanf@atlas.pen.tek.com

The concepts of "right"#and "wrong" (or "correct/incorrect" or "true/false") belong to the#domain of epistemological rather than moral questions.  It makes no#sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is#legitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).##Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives#of epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation, respectively.#One can certainly ask if a percept is "right" (correct, true,#veridical) or "wrong" (incorrect, false, illusory).  But it makes little#sense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand, it is#strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can#certainly ask that question about motives.##Therefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can't be considered:#they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.True, by "correct" I mean "the thing valued is really good".  I shoulduse evaluative terms, but I don't always.  Sorry for the sloppy phrasing.Can you answer if "betterness" is used in in place of @correctness"?##Now the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled:  I agree with#the first part (that the "rightness" of a moral position is a#meaningless question), for the reasons stated above.  But that is#irrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that#one cannot feel peace is better than war.  I certainly can make#value judgments (bad, better, best) without asserting the "correctness"#of the position.You can never say that the thing is @really better@, or "more likelyto better, from all realistic frames of reference"?##Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d).  My short (e) answer is#that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue,#neither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect).  They simply hold#different moral values (feelings).This is where my difficulty arises, though I'm starting to getin now.

Bill, I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider theJosephus reference to be an early Christian insert.  By biblical scholar I meanan expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let thechips fall where they may.  This excludes literalists, who may otherwise bedefined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They arenot trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).Why an insert?  Read it - I have, a number of times.  The passage is glaringlyout of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere in his work.  The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which it lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.Until you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong aboutthe Josephus insert, your "proof" is meaningless and it should not be repeatedhere.  What's more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would "prove"nothing.  Scholars speak of the "weight of evidence."  Far more independentevidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, yourbelief is based on faith.  That's OK, but you exceed your rights when you passfaith off as fact.As for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaringinconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn't a perfect canon be perfect? Shouldn't there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel Fictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for Herb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share an evolutionary ancestry).The fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not denyyour position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels "prove" your faith. Independent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have alreadydiscussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith. Moreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attemptedto "prove" your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different thansaying "I am right because I say so."  Your logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian General Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where"fundamentalist" came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1)Jesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodilyresurrected, 4) Jesus' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is theclincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe"inerrant" broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take thefirst four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrantbible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to contain the first four.  Smoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!Its faith, Bill.  You don't have any more or better truths than anyone else. Whatever works for you.  Just don't foist it on others.

Morality is not a necessity for a functionalcollection of peoples, just a set of acceptable behaviours (is this the samething?).  There is no universal moral standard as there are many differentsituations in which collections of social organisms find themselves. Somespecies of bees see nothing wrong with kicking out a large number of malebees because they are being a burden on the food supplies of the colony. Thebees die of course, but it was for the good of the colony as a whole, so wasit immoral? Our society (at least our western one) is one of abundance when it comes tothe basics; food, water and shelter.  Therefore our moral standards arebased upon those circumstances.  Unfortunately we enforce our moralstandards on collections of peoples who are not in similar situations,because we believe in some "universal morality".  What I am saying is that,yes, you CAN still murder my sibling, but don't expect your peers to beimpressed by it in our society. However in some other circumstances, it mayactually be a "moral" thing to do (in which case it wouldn't be calledmurder, probably sacrifice). After the act, you could say what you liked,but you must make a conscious decision on whether or not your society willcondone your act, so as to evaluate the consequences to yourself, includinghow you will feel about it (remember your feelings have been sociallyimbued).Jeff.I keep trying to write a book of ideas in two paragraphs and it just comesout disorganised garble!

To the degree that relativism is a more accurate decription of thetruth than is objectivism, it provides more power and ability tocontrol events.Assuming, for the moment, that morals _are_ relative, then tworelativists can recognize that neither has a lock on the absolutetruth and they can proceed to negotiate a workable compromise thatproduces the desired results.Assuming that there is an absolute morality, two disagreeing objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right; thereis no room for compromise.  Once you beleive in absolute morals,you must accept that you are amoral or that everyone who disagreeswith you is amoral.Given a choice between a peaceful compromise or endless contention,I'd say that compromise seems to be "better".-- Ray Fischer                   "Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truthray@netcom.com                 than lies."  -- Friedrich Nietzsche

How true. This claim wouldlend substantial support to the notion that religions are actuallyseamless virtual realities.Does god exist or not? To us, this question is a true dichotomy.Can god know a reason for her existence? If she is omniscient, thenshe must know this. There is a philosophical problem whether anythingcan exist without a time frame - for instance, if it were possible toobserve our universe from 'outside', in the neverness surroundingthis universe, it would never have existed. Thus, we are faced with a trilemma:1) God 'meta-exists', and from this meta-existing perspective shecreated existence, the Universe and everything. This implies that the universe was not actually formed of nothing, whichis precisely what many theories of cosmogenesis (Lizhi & Shuxian: Creation of the Universe) say. This 'nothingness' is not empty enough,it is not the transcendental nothingness where there is no existence,until (there is no 'when' yet, but never mind) god, the source ofall existence, started to play. I fail to see the difference betweenthese two forms of nothingness, though. If there isn't one, it mightbe god is not necessary for creation.It is obvious that the levels of 'meta-existence' are not necessarilylimited to god, there might be a 'meta-god' on some other level.2) God exists, and has always existed (she has a timescale, whichis different from our own). This sounds sensible, but it is difficultto conceive how she could know why she exists - a being whichhas always existed, and is infinitely conscious of itself, canremember that she has always been the same, and perhaps know herselfcompletely, but she cannot know why she exists, and how she knowseverything she knows. Would a knowledge of how a being with a personality (a subjective viewpoint) knows everything be thisbeing's knowledge? A conscious being conscious of everything isactually a contradiction in terms - it means that god is onlyconscious of herself, since we, and the whole universe, arealready incorporated in her mental models, thoroughly modelled.Actually, a conscious being conscious of only itself is notconscious at all. 3) God is herself the Existence. This is nothing more than an Orwellianredefinition of the word existence. A logical consequence of thisstatement is that god is actually _all_ existence. I think this isalso called a form of pantheism.: If this: being declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has: defined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed,: He is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically: self-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an: objective sense.In a reality god is supposed to have created, I cannot believe inher, is that my fault or the creator's fault? God gave me freedomof choice, but nevertheless knows what I will opt for, is it fairplay on her side?If god has a conscious mind, in any sense, she has a point of view.I'd say she is entitled to her opinions about me, but I still insistthat any harm she might attempt to do to me will be met with resistance and disapproval. : If God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective.No, an objective standard means something independent on _any_subjective viewpoint, _including_ god's point of view. : If human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that: standard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative: morality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous,: meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to: misunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to: meet that standard is therefore objectively determined.What standard? My morality (and my conscience)  disagrees with the'standards' of the Bible. Which one to ignore? How to interpretany divine standard? There is a great discrepancy even among Christians on this. For instance, the Bible does not condemnfemale homosexuality - why many Christians do, thinking god doesn'taccept it anyway?Bill, to reject a concept of any objective morality does not make theterm nebulous. Morality is the subjective aspect of societal behaviour,something we can change, and something that _must_ change whensocieties change. It might be some basic concepts are hard-wiredin our brains by evolution, but in the end, we must decide ourselves.I don't think people need religion to keep them moral; thinking goes beyond threat of punishment. : Just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is: infinitely malleable, doesn't mean that the objective standard itself: doesn't exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural: norm, or the preferred conduct of "decent" people, making it seem: subjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard.I've yet to see an objective standard that is a) universally applicable (today and tomorrow)b) universally acceptable (not against our own concepts of what ismoral and what isn't): Ironically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true: nature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being: contrary to human nre, oppressive and severe. This may be due as: much to our amoral inclinations as to the standard itself, but like it: or not, it's there.I don't think Christian morality is of a particularly high standard,although it is probably a reflection of high morals of the time,and much of it is still applicable. The problem is that I can'tagree with it all. This is not a question of comforting myconscience with a thought that "I won't be responsible with whatI do", as Christians would put it.

The point is that when we recognize these "instantiations" of mathematicalsystems, we do so because we VALUE being able to describe and perhaps even to control these instantiations. There is always a driving purpose behindthought -- a motive, if you will. Sometimes that motive is relatively "pure", e.g. pursuit of knowledge, othertimes it's "impure", e.g. pursuitof money, or of physical pleasure. But it's always there. And even when itis a "pure" pursuit of knowledge, presumably one pursues knowledge in orderto personally grow, develop, advance to a higher plane of being. So thereis still an element of acquisition, of reaching, of grasping, even in theapproach of the "detached, objective" scientist. >>Now if we're valuing procedures subjectively, and science is a procedure,>>science cannot be valued non-subjectively.

There are two sensesin which we can say that the phenomenon of "the working of the DES chip" is value-based:1) Because there is bound to be some reason why we built the DES   chip and started it running in the first placeand2) Because the very notion/definition/concept of "works" has value   associated with itThe first is a CAUSAL linkage -- we want it to work, therefore we CAUSE it to work. That is rather a mundane interpretation. The second, however, is a more subtle and deeper PHENOMENOLOGICAL linkage -- that the attribute "works" is itself, as everything else, presented to the human consciousness as a _valued_ fact, not just a fact-in-itself. You are perhaps justified in shooting down the causal linkage, but you have not begun to address the phenomenological linkage.>Suns in unpopulated solar systems shine without being blessed by your>values.

Self is, in fact, the very SOURCE of all values. Whatever involves self involves values.- Kevin

Quantum mechanics is very differentfrom biochemistry, yet they both (allegedly) have basises in reality.Look, Frank, noone said that people didn't do science because theyvalue it(in the sense of think it is good), but that is not necessaryto make the observation that it's results have value (in the sensethat they are accurate.) Allow me to give you an example: I thinkthat knowing the byte order on IBM 3090s is pretty much worthless(I don't care to know it) but I would be quite prepared tonote as valuable (i.e. accurate) the claim that it was Big-endianif it was shown to be so (like, by showing me the manual.)> And _no-one_ points>out an _unimportant_ difference, _except_ to say that it's unimportant.>"Important", "useful", "worthy", etc. are all words with evaluative>power, quite different from evaluating an expression.  I'm careful>to use "value" in the sense I mean, which is invariably the first.No, it's fleeking not. Scientific judgement is SOLELY the senseof evaluating an expression (accuracy). It has nothing to do withimportance, worthiness, or usefulness. Choice of problems DOEShave to do with those factors, but they are orthogonal toevaluating (for accuracy) solutions to chosen problems.>#>The concept of a DES box which can be assumed to work as you describe in >#>the absence of an assumption of objective reality is incoherent.

Frank, you are attempting to inject "goodness" judgements where thereare only "accuracy" judgements, by essentially punning on the word'value' which has both meanings. "useful" is a goodness judgement."Reasonable" is an accuracy judgement. They are not the samething at all. ("Useful in making some conclusion" is an accuracyjudgement again, I'm afraid.) Sorry, Frank, but all you're doing isusing the ambiguity of English to obfuscate the issue. IF youmean to say that science is based on value (accuracy) judgements,I have no problem with that.

I think that most see the benefit of a non-anarchistic system.  Our incredibly high standard of living is based on technology, derived from an ordered existance.  We wouln't have got far if we were still bashing each other over the head with clubs, right?The question becomes, is it possible to have an ordered society in which the laws are recognized to be in place based on _enlightened self interest_ as opposed to morality? And secondly, assuming a satisfactory _legal_ code is in place, and we choose to persue individual freedoms as far as possible, is a _moral code_ required or even acceptable?Can an agreement ever be reached?  At what point do we start to comprimise?Think about these questions in light of some recent social issues:TopicLegal?

My arguments are that it is better to exhibit trust, goodness, love, respect, courage, and honesty in any society rather than deceipt, hatred,disrespect, "cowardness", and dishonesty.  No, I haven't been everywhere and seen everyone, but, according to my thesis, I don't have to, since I hold thatwe were all created similarly.

Letterman:  "Are youlike me?  Do you like science and medicine?").Difference is that science is based on consensus.  The points above arewell made,  and obviously there is some discussion as to what thefacts are in some cases.  But if you are willing to play along withthe definitions,  you too can hit the jackpot.  Science also tends touse the principle of totality (vs locality).  You can always look at asmall part of the macrocosm,  yet those miniature pieces are still apart of the total essence.  So the facts to observe are those whichpertain to what questions you're asking.  You may place a value on thequestions,  but in many case,  they are being asked just for the sakeof asking.  And you can say that you're looking at a signal instead oflistening to noise,  but the beauty of science is that it takes bothinto account (the totality aspect).  For science to say that light isa wave and NOT a particle (or vice versa) would be to ignore the totalessence that is light (which is based upon the agreed upon definitions).Why even have definitions?  Why agree upon them?  Well, to communicate insuch a way so that many will understand what you are saying.  Where thecuriosity and drive come from I don't honestly know.I hope I haven't rambled too much.

In chemistry, this usually means we must usedifferent models for different situations.

Before going much further on that thread,I would suggest that you take a closer look at the veriety of worldreligions out there, though. There are athiestic religions as well astheistic religions. There are religions that claim knowledge aboutsuch things as an afterlife, and there are religions that make no suchclaims. My perspective is that lots of people talk, but all that means is thattalk is cheap. When someone gives me substantial evidence about anafterlife, then I'll start believing in one.

Unfortunately, I have no confidence thatsuch a situation will ever arise. Some of us think there's a big God in the sky, some don't.  Some thinkthey've been chosen by God, others disagree.

The fact is, there are *two* references toJesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_, one of which has unquestionably at leastbeen altered by Christians.  Origen wrote, in the third century, thatJosephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, while the long passagesays the opposite.  There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of theJews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-hofor Jesus and may be authentic.   There is no question that Origen, in the third century, saw a referenceto Jesus in Josephus.  There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ whichlack the references.It is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted, butI don't think it's very likely--nor do I think there is a consensus inthe scholarly community that this is the case. (I know G.A. Wells takesthis position, but that's because he takes the very small minority viewthat Jesus never existed.  And he is a professor of German, not ofbiblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant tothe historicity of Jesus.)Jim Lippard              Lippard@CCIT.ARIZONA.EDUDept. of Philosophy      Lippard@ARIZVMS.BITNETUniversity of ArizonaTucson, AZ 85721

This is true inexactly the same sense that as a philosophy Christians' disbelief inZeus is worthless.  Atheists construct their personal philosophiesfrom many different sources, building non-god-based ideas in the sameway as Christians build non-Zeus-based ideas of thunderbolts.Atheists no more *base* their philosophy on atheism than Christiansbase theirs on the nonexistence of Zeus.The "weak atheist" position is logically extremely assailable -- anylogical demonstration of the existence of a god completely destroys itas soon as the demonstration is made in the presence of a given weakatheist.  Atheists in this newsgroup are barraged regularly withattempts to provide such a logical demonstration, and they all failmiserably.  In fact, most of the people around here who claim the"strong (as opposed to mathematical) atheist" position do so on thisbasis: not only do we not believe in a god, but also all the argumentspresented in favor of particular gods have to date proven unsound;therefore, one can say that those gods as argued by those arguments donot exist.  This doesn't apply to such philosophers' gods as aredefined to be logically undemonstrable, but these are not the gods ofpopular religion, and the coherence of such claims is quitequestionable. -- Jim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NCThese are my opinions.

Based onobservable phenomenon.By this definition, science does not have an objective worth, since thephrase "objective worth" is an oxymoron. However you asked something a little differently this time, you asked for an objective basis for anotion. The fact that the use of science as an intellectual tool isresponsible for changes in our world (the changes are material, andthus "objective") would provide an objective _basis_ for an argument.However, the conclusion arrived at from that argument (that science is "good") is subjective.I think that the problem here is one of word usage.

Cases in which their mental capacity is imnpaired.   Casesin which they err about the true value of what they are selling.Pretty soon you have to start talking about "informed owner""competent owner" "educated owner" and so on, and the conceptgets less and less clear and exceptions more and more plausible.But the real problem remains that of looking only at end-pointsin a context.    Maybe most of us will agree with you that a pebble is "small" and that the Moon is "big", but that does not mean thatyou have an objective measuring scale.   Only that these two are fairly common opinions *in context*.An astronomer may claim that the Moon is actually "tiny" anda micro-biologist may remark that a pebble is "huge".   Similarly,if an armed Serbian offers a helpless Bosnian a dollar and his life for his land, rather than killing him and taking it for free, the Bosnian may consider that he is getting quite a good deal.jon.

A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goodsor service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in usefulness or importance; merit. 4.

In context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In termsof scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note thatthese definitions do not mean the same thing.In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of areach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of theword "value" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standardof measurement. I would conclude that science does not have itsbasis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if oneconcludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based onsystems derived from observation, then it must follow that in ascientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as"objective values."Back to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow.Just because the word "values" is used in both contexts does not meanthat there is a relationship between the two contexts.If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one mustfirst start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Consideringthe meaning of the word "objective" I doubt that this will ever happen.So, back to the original question:And objective morality is.....?If you can provide an objective foundation for "morality" then that willbe a good beginning.>-- >Frank O'Dwyer                                  'I'm not hatching That'>odwyer@sse.ie                                  from "Hens",  by Evelyn Conloneric
