Would>it be easy to find scalpers outside of the Igloo selling tickets?There are ALWAYS scalpers with tickets outside the Arena.  You might haveto pay a few bucks extra, but you can always find them.  Look on thestreet under the message board, or out on the street in front of the Hyatt,or even around Gate 1.  The later you buy them, the less money you'll pay,and during the regular season you could usually find some for near facevalue or below if you wait until game time.  Might be better to pick themup earlier now, though.rick

The OT game winner came from DimitriYushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERSnever led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked anNHL record 9th OT loss this season.Roster move:Gord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGillInjuries:Ryan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched.Lines:Eklund-Lindros-RecchiBeranek-Brind'Amour-DineenLomakin-Butsayev-ConroyFaust-Acton-BrownGalley-BowenYushkevich-HawgoodCarkner-HynesDominic RousselGame Summary:I didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these partsI didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed bya few things I did pick up:First Period:Hartford, Nylander 10, 8:51Philadelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp)Penalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda,Har (interference) 18:43Second Period:Hartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00Philadelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09Hartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38Penalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Harmajor-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski,Har (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50Third Period:Hartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)Philadelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11Philadelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38Penalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30Overtime:Philadelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15.Penalties - NonePower Play:Philadelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4Goalies:Philadelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)Hartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)On the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blueline and Nylander stripped him and took off.The Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and itended up behind the goalie.On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in.This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and ifthey get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner,Galley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one ofthem was the closest FLYER to the play.That's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who itwas that scored, much less how.From what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hartasked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of thegame. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprisedthat a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy Soderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a seasonand, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.But here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi fornumber 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing betweenhim and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????What? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...#1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.The difference between the team's record with him and without him is noaccident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful withoutRecchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with EricLindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jerseynext season.#2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour,and Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn'tplay a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my familyhas a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that TommySoderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains againabout being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.#3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single seasonscoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single playerget as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season.Not a tough choice.Honorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point totalwhich he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top linethis year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get thedefensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookiemistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feelingthat with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving upanything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defensemanin years to come.Garry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are somethings you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome,he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against hiswishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensivecontribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own endwill make him a much more important part of the team next year.Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.But consistency became a problem for him.A couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members:Tom Misnik, a member of the mailing list, would like to exchange E-mailaddresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer.If you're interested, you can send him mail at:att!ACR.ORG!TMISNIKThe FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winningpercentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th inPatrick), 23-14-5 at home. They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th innext years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored asmany goals as they allowed, 319.The 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.I will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the HockeyNews that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I haveno other way of getting them.I hope you've all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as I have.

Can't believe people actually put> win as first in a tie breaker......Then allow me to enlighten you, Rex. You see, there's a thing called a tie. A tie is worth one point (I know, I know. You're not good at math. But bearwith me). A win is worth two points. So, getting two ties is the same as getting one win. If your team played two games, won one and lost one, you'dhave two points. If my team played two games and tied them both, we'd alsohave two points. We'd be tied in the standings even though our records aredifferent.Perhaps you should learn something about hockey before posting again. (I amstarting to sound like Roger or what?)Alan

The idea was that youngsters couldplay almost as well, and had the potential to improve where theseolder guys did not. And they traded Mullen, because he wanted to go, not because hewasn't good enough, but I think they were a bit too optimisticin thinking they could make up for his contributions.An example from this season, Skriko was brought in on a trial basisbut not kept, because of his age. I thought he was a decentcontributor worth keeping around.The youth movement has its advantages; look at Gaudreau whomight still be in KC if more veterans had been kept around. Butyou have to find the right balance.-----------------------------------------------------------------Steve Cole  (steve@sep.stanford.edu, apple!sep!steve)Department of Geophysics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305

But Rob Niedermayer is a center, nota defenseman.I am not sure that the Sharks will take Kariya.  They aren't saying much, butthey apparently like Niedermayer and Victor Kozlov, along with Kariya.  ChrisPronger's name has also been mentioned.  My guess is that they'll takeNiedermayer.  They may take Pronger, except that they already have too manydefensive prospects.===============================================================================GO CALGARY FLAMES!

Bruins have never come back to win after falling behind 2-0 in theirentire 68-year history. It doesn't look like Buffalo will just losetheir next two games at the Aud with the way Fuhr has been standing onhis head.Basically,the Bruins will be on the golf course by next weekend.Also,it seems like the whole Boston area has gone baseball crazy afteran incredibly great start by the Red Sox(best record in their majorleagues as of now). I would say that 70% of the callers to the Bruins'flagship station(SportsRadio 590) are talking about the Red Sox,about15% are yapping about the Patriots' upcoming draft,10% are on the Celticsand about 5% are on the Bruins.Somehow,no one around here is really schocked the way Bruins are foldingearly.-PPV Mark

Most of the Flames neglectedto show up, especially in their own zone, as the Kings hit at leastfive posts! The Flames best line was probablySkrudland-Paslawski-Berube (which tells how bad the Flames were). GarySuter scored a great goal (in fact all three Flame goals were scoredby D-men - Yawney and Dahlquist getting the others), but also madesome bonehead plays. For the Kings, Pat Conacher was especiallyimpressive. The games was VERY chippy, as Dan Mirouelli lost control early andnever recovered it; there were high-sticks, cross-checks, punches,hits from behind. Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out WarrenRychel from behind. Flames dominated the game physically, but failedto take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses (I don't thinkVernon can be blamed for any of the goals). Calgary went with 7 D-men,as Roger Johansson played LW; he looked lost IMHO - I hope Kinginserts Chris Lindbergh, Paul Kruse, or Sergei Makarov for Wednesday'sgame. Gretzky left the game in the 2nd period with a charley-horse; noidea how serious - he didn't return.I still think the Flames should win this series, but they betterbuckle down.- Vlad the Impaler

Mypoint is that last year the Sharks had toughness that was missingthis year.  This year we had more skill, I'm all for that, butif your skill players keep getting beat up and injured theycan't do you much good.  Whether it's a cheap shot or not youcan't let the other teams push you around.  The 1992-93 Sharkssimply got pushed around to much.  Other teams knew this.They knew they could aggressively check the Sharks and notpay for it.   Adding some players in the off season who willadd some toughness to the team will help insure that nextseason other teams will be more hesistant to vigorously check our skill players, or to take cheap shots.  It doesn'tguarantee no injuries (nothing does), but it's something theSharks can do to reduce the number of injuries.  mark just say #####  #     #    #    ######  #    #   #####           ____                  #     # #     #   # #   #     # #   #   #     #            -_ --__             #       #     #  #   #  #     # #  #    #                    \\    --_           #####  ####### #     # ######  ###      #####                \\      -_              # #     # ####### #   #   #  #          #                |       \\       #     # #     # #     # #    #  #   #   #     #    __________ /         \\_____  #####  #     # #     # #     # #    #   #####  ___________ /            \\___________________________________________________________________________________Mark Spiegel  spiegel@lmsc.lockheed.com   Cow Palace:108/K/8  Epicenter: ?

Evans") writes:: : Of course, penalties will have to be changed:: : Roughing:Chauvanistic Males Being Aggressive: Slashing:Chauvanistic Males Venting Frustration: Fighting:Proof That Males Cannot Cope With Their Feelings: NO NO NO! since all the penalties fall into three classes, there shouldonly be three penalties:1. Foul (Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your   body or stick). If you get 5 you are out for the game.2. Unsportsmanlike contact. (An intentional foul). This inlcludes all the   current flavours of roughing, fighting and boarding. If you get two you   are thrown out of the game, and fined.3. Technical foul. Bad mouthing the ref, by player or coach. Penalty shot   is awarded. Two and you are thrown out of the game.Besides the penalty shot for one technical, if the team gets 5 penaltiesin a period, the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one,until the end of the period. The victim gets two shots if he/she was inthe act of shooting when the foul ocured.This works well for several reasons. First, penalty shots are the mostexciting thing in hockey, right? So, it follows that the more the better.Next, when the player is setting up for a penalty shot, the network cantake a commercial. Finally, with only three penalties, the networkannouncers (Don Meredith, Dick Vitale, John Madden, Pat Summerall, andMarv Levy, among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened beforethe PA announcer says it.Oh, one other rule. When a goal is scored (10-20 times a period), the playcannot resume until the PA announcer announces it. This way, the networkcan sneak in a few more commercials. Then, once the PA announcer has toldthem who scored, the TV announcer can tell you the viewer, and even have a chance of pronouncing his name right.Seriously, though, I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week,for the first time in my life. I was amazed how boring it was. The play isso slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shootingcontests DURING THE PERIOD!. Of course the 'Laker Girls' get to do their routines at least 6-8 times during the game, and not just between periodseither. There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average, maybe less. Thegame is 48 minutes, with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a10 minute halftime, and it still takes over 2 hours.The reason for this has to be TV. There is plenty of room to throw incommercials, and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening.On TV, basketball is fairly entertaining, IMHO. But, it is better to watchit on TV than to be there. If this is the road the NHL is following, thenit truly is a sad day.Enough for now.dvb

Can't believe people actually put>win as first in a tie breaker......Golly, I love stupid people. :-)Listen, Rex, this is hockey.  The NHL, to be precise.  And in the NHL,there exist these things called "ties".  A tie occurs when a game endswith the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie. There also exits these things called "wins".  A win is when one team has ahigher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each otherat a time, so I can say "the opponent".)  A team gets two points for awin.  So, let's say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10ties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  Thefirst team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86points.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the numberof wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That's amazing.  So,Rex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, thenthat's what it means.  In our example, the second team would win thetiebreaker and therefore have the "better" record, even though both teamshad the same number of points.  If you didn't understand this post, Rex,maybe you should go back and read it again, very slowly.:-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)--    Keith KellerLET'S GO RANGERS!!!!!LET'S GO QUAKERS!!!!!kkeller@mail.sas.upenn.eduIVY LEAGUE CHAMPS!!!!

A columnist for the St. Paul "Pioneer Press" wrote an article giving the "inside scoop" on the issue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible candiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic Center (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty confident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will ultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other two sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the inter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can't remember his name) believes that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also, because of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed until (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.  However, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed, because the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for conventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to this mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future viability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even further.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of knocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging Minneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would bebe even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met, which may happen.Regarding possible candidates, the three teams are Hartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota "Ice Demons?") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn't been announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the Target Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in as many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn't be surprised to see Hartford and Tampa show up there either.So, Minnesota may end up getting another team, but it may take a few years.Go Sabres!Robert Andolina (former Buffalonian living in Minneapolis)randolin@polisci.umn.edu

So there's a kind of nostagia for the old days, before expansion, the Soviet series, Gretzky and even Bobby Orr, when guys weren't afraid to take a hit, nobody floated and defensemen played defence. Who cares that that probably never really existed, the myth is still around in Canada and all the European influence on the game has diminished it in some people's eyes.Personally, I'd like to add before I get flamed, I love the fast-paced "European" game and think Don Cherry is a bit of an idiot. I have to say that I missed him when I was living in the States, though. He is entertaining, even if you end up throwing your popcorn at the screen when he's on.-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------         I stand by all the misstatements that I've made.-- Vice President Dan Quayle to Sam Donaldson, 8/17/89Me Too -- Nick Duncan <duncan@mprgate.mpr.ca>

The Islanders lost in OT and the Devils tied the Pens.  That means if the Islesbeat the Devils on Friday, the will meet the Caps in the playoffs.However, I have some more comments on the Islanders and hockey ingeneral that I need to get off my chest :).  First of all, with the Islanders back-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that the Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period,come on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveablehow many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty wide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played a golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL debut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before, this guy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a Mahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say it's because the Isles don't shoot correctly.  Has anyone else noticed this?Also, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like MickVukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockeytalent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets thepuck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties. Richard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he's adefenseman.  He's got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus. This guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such "enforcers"?  Notonly do fights slow the game down ALOT, but it takes away from the guys who arereally trying to play the game.  I'll be one of the few to admit, I do enjoy a good fight once in a while, but only when it's "called for".  You know, when aguy checks the goalie too hard.  In other words, a violation of "hockey ethics"might cause you to get puched.  But there is no need to start crap when you arelosing or becuase you can get away with it!! Does anyone agree that refereesneed to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and OT?  I mean COME ON already. I'm sick of seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. just becuase thereferee doesn't call it.  OT and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy,not physical prowess.  Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost. If you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have topull a guy down to prevent it, you don't deserve to win in the first place.Just My Honest Opinion,Gary at HofstraACCGSG@VAXB.HOFSTRA.EDUACCGSG@HOFSTRA.BITNET

The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less thanthat after last night), their save percentages are close, and their recordsare similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel asthe most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.You say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very wellbe, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed inthose games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh,the defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.> The same> for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a> great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If> you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.But I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him playfor the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's justmy opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought thatabout Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'mbatting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.As for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by theoffensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make thesave.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn'tget the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that'swhat the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force theshooter to beat him.> But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie> stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel> doesn't have a game like that in him.I seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh onopening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defendingchamps.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he wassenational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that aMontreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that gameand just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense arepart of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts.Anyway, I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel andI'm not going to argue about it anymore.  Besides, with the current7-game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year, Idon't want to piss you off to the point that you don't sell me anytickets next season:-).                                         \\ \\Joe Dakes                                 \\/\\AT&T Microelectronics                      \\/\\555 Union Boulevard                         \\ \\Allentown, PA  18103                     LET'S GO FLYERS! alux1!jmd                                     \\ \\jmd@aluxpo.att.com                             \\ \\__________                                                \\____/_//__/

Pros arrive late, nervousness for rookie WC players, and problems to get the lines clicking may make things hard to get it going against these "worse" nations. I'd guess that the better team you face in the opening game, the better it is, since the chances of an upset are greater then. Some other reasons why the "worse" teams are so tough to beat was presented by Hans "Virus" Lindberg (former coach in Switzerland). 1) The "worse" teams (referring to France, Switzerland, Austria, Italy etc)    have now usually world class goalies. 2) Their defensive play have become much more disciplined, they take much    less unnecessary penalties. 3) They use four lines which makes it harder to make them "run out of gas." 4) The ice quality in the German WC rinks is poor.>  The only convincing winner was...

Wealso get to see Don Cherry's Grapevine just before the game. TheGrapevine is a hockey talk show where Don talks to a player or coachabout what else: Hockey.  It's actually a pretty good show and Donisn't as annoying as he is on Coaches Corner.  I think this is wereDon got his nickname 'Grapes' but I'm not sure.  Don use to coach theBoston Bruins.  I don't know exactly when that was.  Could someone fillme in on this info?  A local radio station here in Detroit (WLLZ) talks to Don every Tuesdaymorning.  Personally, I've had my fill of Donny!  He really pisses me offsometimes.  During the Detroit-Toronto game Monday night on CBC, Don gavehigh praise to Doug Gilmour, saying he was a two-way player and notjust a designated goal scorer and that he is probably the best playerin the game because of that.  That's fine and I agree that Gilmouris a good two-way player BUT he said the EXACT same thing about Yzermanabout a month ago on a local radio talk show.  What gives?  It seems like he just has a set speech that he changes when he goes fromcity to city.  Don Cherry:  'I think <insert star player name for city that he is in>              is the best two-way player in the league today.'   There have been other times (can't remember exactly what he said) that hebasically changed his opinions to match the audience he was talking to.  Someone here on the net said something about how Don criticized MarioLemieux but when the time comes for Don to broadcast the Cup playoffsfrom the Civic Center (Yes, I think the Pens will make it out of theWales Conference) Don will apologize left and right for his remarks aboutLemieux.  In my opinion, he is an ass.  And I won't change my opinionif I'm in a different city.  Sorry, if this didn't answer your question better but I just had to getthis off my chest.

Bostonplayers can't seem to get control of the puck anywhere near the Buffalo netexcept for on rare occasions.  The Buffalo defense is also doing an excellentjob clearing away rebounds.  Fuhr is playing great when the big save is neededbut he's also getting plenty of help.Boston has been playing rather well (better than would be indicated by the series score of 3-0) but is lacking that extra drive in the earlier part of the game.  As a result, Boston keeps leaving the ice at the end of the 1st period2 goals down.  This MUST stop if Boston is to have any hope of winning a singlegame (the outlook for the Bruin's advancement to the second round are quitebleak).  IMHO, the Bruins NEED to score first.  If they can do that, they havean excellent chance of winning, since they have outplayed the Sabres in the 2nd and 3rd periods.(The scary thing is that I'll be going to grad school in Buffalo next year.   I'll never cheer for the Sabres... You can't convert me... ^:)MTM3-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Mike Mosscrop  --  Die hard Bruins fanDept. of ChemistryUMass-Lowellmosscropm@woods.ulowell.edu

They may be biased toward Canadian teams, but theydon't treat the viewers like idiots, they provide nice updates, and Don Cherrywill always provide a few laughs.

At the  4 PM Saturdayafternoon press conference held at the new Mullins Center Arena - formerBoston College Asst. Coach Joe Mallen was awarded the 4 year, $85,000/yearcontract as Head Coach for the UMass Minutemen. Mallen was the third viable pick for the position, right behind Jeff Jackson(Lake Superior) and second behind Shawn Walsh (UMaine). Previous offers for the position were rumored to have been offered to the asst. coaches ofBrown, RPI and the head coach of the AHL Springfield Indians.UMass hockey was disbanded in 1979 due to financial constraints that hadundermined the team's position over a period of years. In late Novemberof last year, the $52 million Mullins Sports Center was opened followingits one year construction deadline. The Minutemen are slated to play an independent Div II/Div III schedule thisupcoming winter before officially entering Hockey East for the Winter 1994season. Mallen has yet to comment on player recruitment strategies orpotential team candidates for the Minutemen - it is expected that he willleverage off his inside contacts within New England, the Bay State andEurope to draw on competitive, top ice players for the University.UMass has slated 18 hockey scholarships for the upcoming Fall semester ; expect to hear more from me as I hear more from my sources.....

I understand that part.But it's a bit inaccurate to call us "selfish" just because we wantto watch the watch the game we love. Am I, as a baseball fan, "selfish"when I get pissed a CBS for showing approximately one game per month?I don't think so.While, ESPN may have contractual obligations, we, as their consumers,have a right to voice our displeasure with how they are serving us.There's certainly nothing wrong with that.    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    + Bri Farenellfarenebt@craft.camp.clarkson.edu   +    + AHL, ECAC and Boston Bruins contact for rec.sport.hockey   +    + Adirondack Red Wings, Calder Cup Champs: '81  '86  '89  '92   +    + Clarkson Hockey, ECAC Tournament Champs: '66  '91  '93   +    + Glens Falls High Hockey, NY Division II State Champs: '90  '91       +    + AHL fans: join the AHL mailing list: ahl-news-request@andrew.cmu.edu +    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**.Of course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how youget them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're acoach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, youhave got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Torontogame, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing inthat game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The samefor Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made agreat play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. Ifyou were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goaliestand on his head to get that shutout.

The empirical evidence of the last two decades is that more people willshow up to see the Bruins play the Sabre umpteen times than see theBruins play the Captials in the first round.Maybe hockey has increased in popularity sufficiently that this willno longer be the case.  The experiment is worthwhile with the unevendistribution of the expansion teams, but I prefer the divisional playoff.Gerald

After the trade, the Bruins were in two finals and one semi-final, all of which, of course, they lost to Montreal (which should please you to no end).

Jagr did not have a better season than  Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of  hockey knowledge.  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty  plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.  Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice  time per game and some measure of its "quality" (i.e., is the player put out  in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up  against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would  much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious  merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.

Both teams seemed a bit tense in theopening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off.  The Kings gotinto the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out-standing team defense.  It took the Flames 9:45 of the first period to recordtheir first shot on goal.  The Kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams onpenalty killing, shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play and could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings hadtheir problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10tries.The Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at theblue line, allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the Flames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex-pected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horsein his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to the dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this morning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday.1st period: 1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky wonthe draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped thepuck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to thefar side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. Heput the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set upin 'his office', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle whereSydor had moved in.  Sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the hash mark, shot off the pass, beating Vernon low and between the legs.Millen and Fleury went off at 4:57.  Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kingsfailed to convert.  Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert.Dahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30, giving the Kings a 30second 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts inthe period.2nd period: The Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failedto convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck intothe stands and received a delay of game.1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with thepuck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit the stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated down the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle andskated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him and he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander.2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play.Shuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headedfor the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot where 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carsoncame from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shotbetween the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease.3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked offthe puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a passcross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot,beating a diving Vernon on the glove side.4-1. 2:59 later, the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form thenear point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got hisown rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the lowslot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon.Skrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40, giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but theyfailed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutivepower plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for highsticking at 17:31.  Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period.  TheKings hit 3 goal post in the period.3rd period:The Kings used the phrase "Initiate, not retaliate" and it was very evident herein the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames continued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark.  The Kings shotthe puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net tocut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him,wacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to thecrease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the netwhere Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon.Sydor went off at 1:24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4.5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the netand passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the crease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey.Carson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleurytripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where Fleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing a 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark.  Unfortunately, the Kings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6:44) and Watters (at 8:19) took penalties.  5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark.  MacInnis, at the near point, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards thenet, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove ofHrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA.6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power playto seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone cut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed the puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass, beating Vernon on the ice, stick side.At the 16:17 mark, Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as hewent after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a singleminor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flamesright out of the game.On the plus side:  The Kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockeyas they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellentpenalty killing.On the minus side:  The Kings lost almost every face-off.  This must improve orthe Flames will surely get that power play back on track.Notes:------The Kings recalled Guy Leveque, Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix.Wayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point.The Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, givingthe opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game.Flames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3-9-1 record in afternoon games.  The Flames entered the game with a 34% success rate on the power playover their last 9 games.The teams were 3-3-1 against each other in the regular season.Playoffs:Campbell Conference:Smythe Division:LA  6  @ CAL 3 LA leads 1-0WIN    @ VANNorris Division:STL 4  @ CHI 3STL leads 1-0TOR    @ DETWales Conference:Adams Division:BUF 5  @ BOS 4 (OT)BUF leads 1-0MON 2  @ QUE 3 (OT)QUE leads 1-0Patrick Division:NJ  3  @ PIT 6PIT leads 1-0NYI 1  @ WAS 3WAS leads 1-0Records:--------vsSmythe Norris PatrckAdamsOverall================================================Home:    0- 0-0  0-0-0   0-0-0  0-0-0    0- 0-0 Road:    1- 0-0  0-0-0   0-0-0  0-0-0    1- 0-0==============================================================Total:   1- 0-0  0-0-0   0-0-00-0-0 1- 0-0  Box Score:=========================Calgary      0 1 2 - 3Los Angeles  1 3 2 - 6=========================1st period: LA  Sydor 1 (Gretzky, Sandstrom), 0:16    LA  Millen - high sticking, 4:57    CAL Fleury - high sticking, 4:57    CAL Skrudland - interference, 12:25    LA  Carson - tripping 14:53    CAL Dahlquist - holding stick, 18:34    CAL Dahl - roughing 19:302nd period:     CAL Verson - delay of game (served by Ashton), 1:34CAL Suter 1 (Fleury), 2:48 (sh)LA  Carson 1 (Shuchuk, Sydor), 3:13 (pp)LA  Huddy 1 (Taylor, Rychel), 3:37LA  McSorley 1 (unassisted), 6:36    CAL Skrudland - elbowing, 10:53    LA  Sydor - tripping, 12:35    LA  Watters- hooking, 14:40    LA  McSorley - holding, 17:19    CAL Suter - high sticking, 17:31    LA  Sandstrom - hooking, 18:033rd period:LA  Millen 1 (Granato, Donnelly), 1:06    LA Sydor - hooking, 1:24    CAL Nieuwendyk - tripping, 3:22CAL Dahlquist 1 (Otto), 4:23    CAL Fleury - major (boarding), game misconduct, 6:08    LA  Granato - tripping, 6:44    LA  Watters - interference, 8:19CAL Yawney 1 (MacInnis, Reichel), 8:47    CAL MacInnis - roughing, 9:56LA  Carson 2 (Sandstrom, Robitaille), 10:32 (pp)    LA  Hardy - holding, 11:38    CAL Skrudland - slashing, 16:17    CAL Stern - double roughing, cross-checking, 10 min. misconduct, 16:17Overtime: noneShots:------Los Angeles   8  9 14 - 31Calgary       5  8 11 - 24Power play conversions:-----------------------For:      2 of 10; for the year:  2 of  10,  20.00%Against:  0 of  8; for the year:  8 of   8, 100.00%Goalies:--------Los Angeles - Hrudey (1-0-0)Calgary - Vernon (0-1-0)Attendance: 18,605Scratches:----------Rob Blake - back contusionGuy Leveque - numbersLonnie Loach - numbersMarc Potvin - numbersBrandy Semchuk - numbersRobb Stauber - numbersBrent Thompson - numbersJim Thomson - numbersLines - Forwards:----------------*Robitaille - Gretzky - Sandstrom Donnelly - Millen - KurriRychel - Conacher - TaylorGranato - Carson - ShuchukLines - Defense:----------------*Huddy - SydorWatters - ZhitnikHardy - McSorley* denotes starting lineupNext game:----------Wednesday, April 21 @ Calgary Flames; 6:30pm Pacific Time on Prime Ticket===============================================================================Stan Willis (willis@empire.dnet.hac.com)net contact: L.A.

Well, I BEG to differ....IMHO, Clark deserved to be a first star as much as Gilmour did. Hisfast breaks towards the net and the good opportunites that hecreated reminded me of the Clark of old. (But not to take any of thecredit away from Gilmour).I think the Leafs are playing GREAT hockey. WHY? Well first look at their injury list which includes, Cullen, Ellet,Zezel, Macoun. Of course my question is this....how will the Leafsfare when they are once again "healthy" if they are playing this wellso far??Second, just look at their standings, still second in defence,moved from 11th overall to 6th over in the last month, haven't lostat home in last 12 games, 8 game undefeated streak..etc.(BTW, am I wrong or was this Potvin's first shut-out? I can't remember him having any as of yet.)Well, as of April 3 we see that the race for first in the Norrishas truly begun and it will be a VERY CLOSE race between Chicago andToronto. And the best game of the season will probably be their lastagainst each other.

Pre-game comments-----------------Don's pregame comments were mostly aimed at the goalies... The goaliewho gets back his all-star form (Roy or Hextall) can win the seriesfor his team.Eposode Summary---------------This episode took place rinkside. Don was holding a hot dog thathe bought from the concession stand.Ron Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in theToronto Sun. It featured a picture of Don, who just saw his shadowand proclaimed "Will you look at dat, eh? Means another 6 weeksof me. Beauty."Next, Don talked about the hot dog he was holding. According tohim, the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in allthe arenas in the NHL.From there, Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game. The gamehad great flow, because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best gamein the NHL. In contrast, the Calgary-LA game was terrible... Allstop-and-go, over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgaryby Dan Marouelli. Its getting so that the ref who calls the mostpenalties gets to ref in the finals.Next, Ron showed an old picture of Don, when he was playing forthe Rochester Americans of the AHL. Don recalled some of thewins that he had in the Quebec arena... during the Memorial cupand the AHL championships.Finally, Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of theRangers. The rangers were a talented team who underachieved.Don feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith, who hadseveral key injuries (to Leetch and Patrick) and goalies whowent cold.Don had some criticism for the Rangers team... The party's over,Adolf (Keenan) is there. The Rangers organization will no longerbe a 'country club'.... "NY should be achamed of themselves... Ifthey go in the tank with Adolf there, they'll be hanging from theyardarm by their thumbs."Rating------Nothing too special in this episode.I'll give it a 5.5 out of 10.------------------------------------------------------------------------------   \\  \\                   |Allan Sullivan (allan@cs.ualberta.ca)    \\  \\                  |Department of Computing Science,     \\  \\_______          |University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.      \\    ###  \\     _   |---------------------------------------------------       \\___###___\\   (_)  |My opinions are mine and mine alone.------------------------------------------------------------------------------"It is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the credit..."          - U. of A.

In fact, in the case of Doug Gilmour, he actually praises them.Europeans that do those things are scum in Cherry's opinion. Canadian kidsthat do them are "tough, just like a real Canadian". Ulf Samuelsson cheap shots Mark Messier's ribs and Don wants Ulf's head. DougGilmour breaks Tomas Sandstrom's arm and Don says Sandstrom had it coming. Methinks Don is either very confused or just a bigot. Most likely the latter.I used to like Don Cherry. I thought he was great. But I'm starting to seehis true colors (redneck) and the more I see of them, the more I think he'sjust an asshole.Alan

They give theirgeneral managers one order when it comes to the draft...find me the bestplayers so that our team will win the Stanley Cup.  Whether that player isin Kindersley, Saskatchewan or Chelyabinsk, Russia, if the GM believes himto be the better player, the GM should be drafting him.Where do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league, when referring to Canadianplayers.  It doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the owners.  The ownerscan do what they want.  While a 'Canadian content' rule might be enforcablehere in Canada, there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the USthat the CFL (sorry for the football reference) didn't even TRY to push theirimport ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers.Increasing the competition for the 'elite' positions, in most cases, wouldmake players better anyways.  (Oh yeah, and how many Europeans play at thelower levels of professional hockey in North America?  While there are somethat play in the AHL, or the IHL where that's an NHL team's primary farmclub, you don't hear of many Europeans playing in the CHL, the ECHL, or onthe secondary farm teams in the IHL.  (ie. the Jets do have a few Russianplayers in Moncton, but I don't believe there are any Europeans in Ft. Wayne.))So with all those teams, there are plenty of positions for hockey playersin North America.>>    With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearly>only getting worse.>>    I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let the Bures>and Selannes of the world play on their own continent.>>    I just don't want them on mine.I'm in favour of the NHL being the league for the premier players in theworld.

Let's face it, he just returns from radiation therapy with around a dozen games left, overtakes Lafontaine for thescoring lead and then buries him!!!!  No, I guess he just got lucky.Speaking of Lafontaine, now there's a guy who should be considered for theHart trophy as well, certainly one of the better players in the league thisyear.

Ville Siren's slap shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period. The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then, during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47. Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund  skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3. Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since there was traffic in front, 4-3. Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan "the Shadow" Nilsson. Stefan and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3. Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone  with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot. The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot, showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side. But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the game's final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved. All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn't the best. Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period to try no combinations. Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson- Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line. Stillman good on defense. Some players aren't good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson will likely have to leave for NHL pros. Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn't have a very good game, we've seen him a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland's starting goalie in the WC. I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team. It would be inter- resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Starting lines: SWEDENFINLAND  35.

The Jetslooked more dangerous in this one but it didn't make a difference in the numbers that counted: goals.Vancouver's big line produced again, with centre Cliff Ronning andleft winger Geoff Courtnall scoring in the first and in the second to boost the Canucks to a 2-0 lead on giveaways by the suspect Jet defence ofBautin and Ulanov. Mental lapses by the defence and goal-scoring talentin opportune areas made the difference in all three Canuck goals.However, as in the first game, the Jets worked hard to take thegame to the Canucks in the second period. The Jets dominated the second,checking hard and penetrating the Vancouver zone without being challengedby a Canuck team that wanted to pack it in early. The hard work paid off late in the second, when Tie Domi caughtVancouver goalie Kirk McLean by surprise with a sharp angle shot to makethe score 2-1. Domi's goal gave the Jets new life as they began to take the rushto the Canuck's collapsing defence. The Canucks were unwilling to do anything but let McLean take shots and clear the rebounds. The Jets wereallowed to set up and make plays.Both goalies made standup saves as the play picked up considerably.McLean made three great saves in the second off a dancing Teammu Selannewhile Essensa was rocked by a Pavel Bure drive. Selanne looked dangerouson the rush as the Jets pressed a series of attacks into the Canuckzone. The Canucks, on the other hand, looked like they were offering fourchecking lines in an effort to preserve their slim lead.A series of minor penalties at the end of the second periodresulted in a one man advantage for the Jets in the early third. TheJet's Tempo Numminen drove a puck from the point through McLean'slegs and into the net to tie the game at 2-2.The Canuck's discordant play picked up where it left off.This was characterized by long lead passes that either never connectedor were picked off by the Jets and individual rushes into a tightWinnipeg defence that were never supported.However, as in the first and second Canuck goals, a Jet defensivelapse (re: bonehead play) stalled the Winnipeg comeback. With the faceoffin the Winnipeg zone, Pavel Bure was left to stand in the crease withno Jet defender anywhere near him. Bure, who had been invisible in thegame up to that point, took a rebound and managed to roof it with a backhand even though he was off balance. By then it was too late for the Jets to come back. Essensa made itto the bench with one minute to go but the extra attacker did nothingfor their attack. Canucks 3, Winnipeg 2.Next game is Friday at Winnipeg with the Jets in the hole by two games.- 30 -

Nationalrating came out to a very respectable 3.3. Top-29 Nielsen markets wereat 2.9. In Boston,the game scored lower at 2.4 but it had some competionfrom local sports teams.Quite frankly, I expected ABC's ratings to be under 2.0. But I'm happyto be proven wrong!Well,well...Sometimes it pays off clicking away on your cable-tv remotecontrol.:-) And if you happen to be a hockey fan,you could just stumbleupon a playoff hockey game...ESPN picked up Detroit-Toronto game on Monday night because the onlynight game in MLB was being rained out in Chicago. You have to giveESPN credit for switching to Detroit's FOX-50 coverage and having BillClement at a Pittsburgh's TV station(WATE?) for intermission analysis.Maybe,ESPN people were giddy over perliminary over-night ABC ratingsfor Sunday's telecast and thought it was a good idea to feature theNorris division showdown rather than a monster truck competion.Good move,ESPN!-PPV Mark

YES, although the arena is an anachronism (an OPEN wall behind oneof the goals - essentially an outdoor arena!). Cologne's arena only seats about7,000-8,000, Berlin is about 6,000 and no new facility will be builtunless their Olympic bid is successful. Munich does have an arena. > Sweden       : Stockholm, Gothenburg (Malmo, Gavle)Malmo is big enough, but they also need a new arena...the current one has 5,000 seats I think.> Finland      : Helsinki (Turku, Tampere)If we're talking about the NHL, even Helsinki would struggle to make it work.Turku (despite an excellent arena) and Tampere are nowhere near big enough formajor league hockey.> Italy        : Milan...Rome and the south are out of the question; this could as well be Africato hockey fans. Romans were given the chance to host some WC'94 games butshowed no interest whatsoever. All teams in the Italian league come from Milanand the smaller cities in the north.> France       : Paris (Chamonix, Ruoen?)Paris had their own "Volans Francais"(sp) pro team a couple of years ago.I believe they even made it to the European Club Championship finals tournament one year, but eventually folded due to lower-than-hoped-for attendances.

It was tight right downto the last second of the third period.  In the overtime Roy and Hextall playedlike they were gods.  Ok, so Montreal won!  They deserved it after getting their first goal inovertime waved off because the puck was hit in with a high stick.  Their secondgoal in overtime was also replayed, but I could not tell if it was the Montrealplayer who kicked it in.  The puck definitely was not directed in by a stick.Anyways, Montreal is back into the series.

Atlanta's ABC has declined to pick up anyplayoff games till May9. And even when they show the games on MAy9 and May16,they will continue to skip the first half hour of the telecast. I know thisis still a better situation compared to rest of Georgia, Alabama, etc., butit is still pretty annoying. At least in PIttsburgh, we had a network preemptionchannel which showed all netwoork shows prempted by the local affiliate.I asked them what their problem was. I told them that a local 1.9 rating wasnot that bad considering it was the first NHL game shown after a long timewithout much promotion. Besides, their syndicated programming in the afternoonis usually low rated. So what did they have to lose by showing NHL playoffs.She told me that they had contractual obligations. I asked her if golfwas shown oin ABC, would contractual obligations come in the way. And how comecontractual obligations didn't come in the way of last week's telecast? Shethen couldn't give me a coherent answer.Also, I added that Atlanta had one of the highest neutral site gameattendances and that the demographics were good. I think ABC and other networksshould begin to tie their high rated programs like Roseanne in with thier sports programming.I hope that everyone in Atlanta who reads this bboard calls WSB 2 and complainbitterlyt about this. Tell them you will stop watching their news telecastssince they seem to be very unprofessional in handling this situation.The lady did not seem to settle on a single reason. Sometimes, the reasonis low ratings. Then another time, she says contractual obligations.

I wouldargue this is having an effect here. Kids play ice hockey in thewinter and road hockey in the summer with in-line skates.

Biggest disappointment = the player from whom we expected more (e.g., I      picked Denis Savard in Montreal because with the new emphasis on      offence brought by Demers, shouldn't Savard have done better?)   -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Team           Biggest       BiggestTeam:                   MVP:          Surprise:    Disappointment:-----------------------------------------------------------------------Boston Bruins           Oates          D.Sweeney     WesleyBuffalo Sabres          Lafontaine     Mogilny       Audette (jinx?)Calgary Flames          Roberts        Reichel       PetitChicago Blackhawks      Roenick        Ruuttu        GouletDetroit Red Wings       Yzerman        Chaisson      KozlovEdmonton Oilers         Manson         Buchberger    MellanbyHartford Whalers        Sanderson      Cassells      CorriveauLos Angeles Kings       Robitaille     Donnelly      HrudeyMinnesota North Stars   Modano      Tinordi(not expected back)  BrotenMontreal Canadiens      Muller         Lebeau        SavardNew Jersey Devils       Stevens        Semak         MacLeanNew York Islanders      Turgeon        King(finally) MaroisNew York Rangers        Messier        Kovalev       BourqueOttawa Senators         MacIver        Baker         JelinekPhiladelphia Flyers     Lindros/Recchi Fedyk/Galley  EklundPittsburgh Penguins     Lemieux        Tocchet(even for him)  JagrQuebec Nordiques        Sakic/Ricci    Kovalenko     PearsonSan Jose Sharks         Kisio          Gaudreau      MaleySt Louis Blues          Shanahan       C.Joseph      Ron SutterTampa Bay Lightening    Bradley        Bradley       Creighton/KasperToronto Maple Leafs     Gilmour        Potvin        Ellett/AndersonVancouver Canucks       Bure           Nedved(finally)    MomessoWashington Capitals     Hatcher        Bondra/Cote   ElynuikWinnipeg Jets           Selanne        Selanne       Druce----------------------------------------------------------------------  As I mentioned up top, these are my *impressions* from where I sit.

When Quinn took over Vancouver- several years ago, NOT LAST YEAR, they regularily missed the playoffs.  I can't recall if they missed the playoffsthe year before his hiring but they probably did.  Quinn has improved theteam from non-playoff calibre to a serious contender.When Murray took over in Detroit, the were about a .500 team that was acontender to win the Norris division and possibly even a Stanley Cupcontender.So Quinn has improved his team more than Murray has since taking over as a GM.Quinn is one example of a better GM than Murray.Gregmeister

The present captain is Craig McTavish and we'll        just have to wait and see.        well talk to you later        Steve...

He's out until: next year after surgery to repair a shoulder separation.: Stu Barnes might be an AHL gun for the Hawks, but he's now the third: line center with the Jets, and has been since mid January or so.Sorry, my memory is gone. I thought that O'Neill got sent backdown in February but I must have been given incorrect info. I guessthis says it all about Moncton because Barnes is still one oftheir top 3 or so scorers even though he's been out since January.    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    + Bri Farenellfarenebt@craft.camp.clarkson.edu   +    + AHL and ECAC contact for rec.sport.hockeyGo USA Hockey!   +    + Adirondack Red Wings, Calder Cup Champs: '81  '86  '89  '92   +    + Clarkson Hockey, ECAC Tournament Champs: '66  '91  '93   +    + Glens Falls High Hockey, NY Division II State Champs: '90  '91       +    + AHL fans: join the AHL mailing list: ahl-news-request@andrew.cmu.edu +    + CONGRATS TO THE BOSTON BRUINS, 1992-93 ADAMS DIVISION CHAMPIONS      +    + PHOENIX SUNS, 1992-93 PACIFIC DIVISION CHAMPIONS   +    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I find that Easton blades are easier to get, but all brands of blades are pretty well interchangeable.  Watch out for dried up bits of firewood, that some stores pass off as blades.

It's one thing to say, "Hey, let's give a hockey team to cities that don't have one!" -- that's fine. It'sentirely another to say, "Okay, let's take a team from a thriving hockey townand move it!" Of course, none of us will ever know the real inside story, butfrom what I know, a group of Minneapolis businessmen told Green repeatedly thatthey would purchase the remaining 3600 (?) season tickets to get to the 10,000level that Green wanted, yet he refused every time. It's pretty obvious that hewas determined to get out of Minneapolis at any cost and use the season ticketsthing as an excuse. I was fortunate enough to get to the penultimate game, andthe fans were great! People were tailgating and playing roller hockey in theparking lot before the game, the attendance was so full as to have SRO, and thewhole atmosphere in the Centre was terrific.

A beautiful goal by Brad May (Lafontaine set himup while lying down on the ice) ended it. Fuhr left the game game withan injured shoulder and Lafontaine was banged up as well; however, theSabres will get a week's rest so injuries should not be a problem.Montreal edged Quebec 3-2 to square their series, which seems to beheaded for Game 7.

However, an earlygoal by Brunet in the 3rd won it.The Islanders won their 3rd OT game of the series on a goal by RayFerraro 4-3; the Caps simply collapsed after taking a 3-0 lead in the2nd.

He made no bones about it,the expansion to 28 is on permanent hold until he is satisfied thatthe current allotment of 26 are fully stable.

Press conference next weekMessage-ID: <allan.735596137@swanlake>Date: 23 Apr 93 20:15:37 GMTSender: news@cs.UAlberta.CA (News Administrator)Organization: University of Alberta, Edmonton, CanadaLines: 23Nntp-Posting-Host: swanlake.cs.ualberta.caI heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in Edmonton.Oiler owner Peter Pocklington will be holding a press conferencenext week. While the exact details are not known, it is believedto concern the Oiler's future.Rumour has it that Pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangementwith Copps Collesium in Hamilton. During the press conference,Pocklington may announce the deal. It is quite possible thatthe deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands torenegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium.Northlands has offered to buy the Oilers for $65 million earlier,but the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington.As for me, my opinion is divided... Edmonton has been fairlysupportive of the Oilers. Even though they're a small marketteam, they had many sellouts in the 80s. Even with the problemsthat the team had this year, they still brought in more fansthan many teams in larger cities did. On the other hand, ifthe team does move, there is no place more deserving thanHamilton. Of course, how would that affect the grandrealignment scheme of Bettman?

Barrasso hashad a spectacular year - no slow start, consistently sharp, GAA < 3.0, and leads the league in wins.  Tommy deserves the Vezina.  Given the lack of respect he commands, though, I doubt he will win it.  The other reason concerns the Pens' team defense.  They are hovering around 3rd or 4th in thefewest goals allowed.

During the Pens-Devils gamelast night, second period, I think Kevin Stevens was in thepenalty box, Nicholls punched Kjell Samuellson in the face,then raised his stick like a two handed sword to defendhimself!  All Kjell could do, at 8'7" and 355 pounds, was laugh!And speaking of Swedish Penguins defensemen, Ulf is getting alittle out of hand lately.  His cheap shots are getting morefrequent and more violent.  As everybody in the Meadowlandsexcept for the officials could see last night, he rammed thebutt of his stick down one of the Devil's throat.  I've alwayssupported the argument "he does his job by being irritating,"but he's starting to push it over the edge IMHO.  Of course,Holik's chop to Barrasso's neck wasn't too sportsmanlike either.It seems that he was following the "The only way to beat thePenguins is to injure them" philosophy.As my Modern Drama professor pointed out to me the other day,Jagr was stoned pretty well Tuesday night, and last night aswell, although the 30 seconds he danced around the Devils endwas pretty exciting.Matt at UVA

Mario Lemieux is the explanation, IMHO.  >You could make a case that the *expectation* of an improving team that>would make the playoffs is the reason. Funny you should mention it...this is exactly the case I was going to make.>But I think the reason is Lemieux>had a 168 point season and was the first non-Gretzky to win the Hart and>Ross since 1980.  People turned out to watch him play. I will grant that a star like Mario will draw fans, even if the team sucks. But this is short term only; I still do not think the attendance increase will last, unless the team is a winning/competitive/improving/butt-kickingone.  Pittsburgh was still getting better, so people continued to supportthem.  If they suddenly dropped to, say, 50 points, you'd have knee surgeryfor some of the people jumping off the bandwagon.  >Also, the following year (88-89) the Pens had 89 points not 87. Ok.  My numbers came from the NHL Guide and Record Book. >They made the transaction to try and build a winner around Mario, that is >true.  But the improvement in attendance came before they started doing>this (Coffey late in 1987) and before they even had a playoff bound team.>A doubling of attendance occured in 1984-85 from the previous year.  An>increase from 38 points to 53 points is not going to do that.  The arrival>of Mario Lemieux is what did it. You can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it.  But my point is thatit wasn't Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e.a winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. Andbefore anybody jumps in and says I'm nit-picking and mincing words, go backand read from where this thread started...It might help to think about what would go through a fan's mind who suddenlyfound an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it "gee, Mario Lemieux isamazing, I'll go watch him play", or was it "gee, now we've got a *kick**ass* guy on *our* side, I'll go watch him play".  I think it was the latter.> Similar thing happened in L.A.   Before>Gretzky's arrival, about 12000 per game.  After, constant sellouts.  They>are STILL selling out every game despite showing little or no improvement>since Gretzky's first year there.  How do you explain it?  People are going>to see Gretzky.  they certainly aren't going to see a winner, they haven't>GOT a winner.  They've had MUCH better teams in their past history than>they currently have, yet they didn't draw as well then.I don't think this is accurate.  The *tickets* sell, but people don't go tothe games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticketholders in LA don't always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kingsinitial success following Gretzky's arrival (68 to 91 points, same source)and corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop inattendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.  Whether or not the Kings are a 'winner' is debatable.  I claim that sinceGretzky's arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claimthat McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oilerdynasty...but that's another story and included only because I don't likeMcNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, andthat undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandisingsales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there littletailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at theForum even if the tickets were sold.>I think in the case of a Lemieux or Gretzky, the player can transcend>winning as the major drawing power.  For the short term, IMO.  Although I think that it's inevitable that the teamwill improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky, simply because theymake people around them better.>But winning sure as hell helps.  ;-)Well, at least we are in full agreement here!>This does not make Roger's point any more valid, but the Jets aren'tSo are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point? <couldn't resist...>>getting a HUGE jump in productivity, yet they ARE getting a huge>jump in attendance.  This is due to the emergence of Teemu Selanne.>They have the 17th best record in hockey, it sure as hell isn't because>they are winning.Yes, but they are doing no worse than last year.  I think the same type ofreasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra peopleshowing up at Winnipeg games.  It's difficult to predict, but do you thinkthat if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after theywill maintain their attendance levels?  I seriously doubt it, because in thatcase the expectation of an improving team would be gone, with or withoutSelanne.I did provide the example of Rocket Ismail and the Toronto Argonauts of the CFL...did you leave it out because you don't know much about the CFL?  If that's the case then fair enough, but if it isn't the case then I'm curiousto hear your explanation.

And just for myown curiosity I thought I'd look up the "official" definition of largein the dictionary.  It reads:large - 1.  having more than usual power, capacity, or scope.            2.  exceeding most other things of like kind in quantity or size.Now I have no idea how many letters Bettman may have gotten on the issueor how many people may have signed them.  65 people may be up there, thereby validating definition 2.  I would also wager that the geographicalrange of signatures is quite large, which would give it a large scope.>He might be impressed by the size of the list of names.Why would he be impressed with this unless it were "large"? I am of course assuming that you actually agree with what you are writingand are not simply trying to be a pain about the whole issue to hearyourself speak.  I personally don't know whether or not I agree with the letter.  I havevery mixed emotions about it.  I like the names as they are, and don'tthink they make it that difficult to learn the game, but there might bea shred of validity to the change.  -- Paul W.

AlMorgani (or however you spell the idiot's name) must be from Chicago,because on ESPN, he said "it's not even close--Chicago will definatly winthe Norris Division in the Playoffs, no other team is close."  Everyone ispicking Chicago!  I don't get it, he says it's an "easy choice"?God, Chicago was 1-4-1 against the Wings, and they won the division by apoint or two, followed closely by Toronto, who is also a good team!As for the Leafs beating Detroit--doubt it, but even if they do, theyaren't going to get by Chicago.  If (even more amazingly) they get past theHawks, they would probably face Vancouver, and lose.As for The Habs reaching the Finals, forget it.  Even I, as a devoted Wingsfan, will watch the Penguins easily three-peat as Cup winners.  Lemieux,Jagr, Tocchet, Stevens, and Barrasso, its a done deal.  Sorry Detroit, waittil next year.But hey, these were Paul's picks, and everyone has a right to their ownopinnions, but the Leafs to the Finals??? Yeah. If they make it there, I'llwalk to Toronto to get some tickets, and that's a 700 mile walk!  --Ryan--Detroit Red Wings--the forgotten team!  Go Wings!!

An agitator for sure, but Fleury never has and neverwill have a fight, which seems to be what you're saying Wood is. The closest Fleury ever came to fighting was a game two years ago againstLos Angeles. There was a scrum and McSorley pinched Fleury's head under hisarm. Fleury dropped his gloves and gave McSorley a weak shot to the side of thehead. McSorely, knowing a good thing when he saw one, popped Fleury one rightbetween the eyes. End of fight. Fleury got ten stitches for his trouble.The only player I can ever see Theo fighting is Cliff Ronning, and even thenhe'd be giving up two inches and 10-15 pounds. :-)Alan

Bowman is a great coach...Johnson,: a very good one.  However, Bowman is really not a modern coach, and: Patrick's solution of having him only run the team on game days, and: delegate most of the day-to-day responsibity to the assistants is: a shrewd managerial decision on Patrick's part.  IMHO Bowman is the perfect coach for this group of players at this time. Johnson was the perfect coach two years ago for his group of players. I would say we have been very lucky here in Pittsburgh that the order these coaches came in was this one. (Excluding the unfortunate circumstances which brought about the change.) With the immense talent on the Penguins roster this year, a tougher Bowman keeps the egos in check. Johnson on the other hand, was able to inspire the younger, inexperienced players to new heights. Both coaches have / had different strengths. Both of which came at exactly the right time. Another person also mentioned that Bowman is the perfect coach for this time since nobody can argue with his decisions. How can you argue with the coach with the best record in hockey anyway? Playing for a great coach like that demands respect which also keeps the egos in check. Just a couple of ideas.--_____________________________________________________________________________Tom Huot               huot@cray.com ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is a no-brainer.While I agree that Lemieux deserves the Hart, it is far from a "no-brainer". The Hart trophy goes to the player most valuable to his team, not to the bestplayer in the league. So your above arguement is really worthless. The Pens without Mario are still a damn good hockey team. The Leafs without Gilmour would have been fighting Tampa Bay for the 3rd pick. Like I said, Mario deserves it, IMHO. But it is a very close race and a Gilmour victory would not surprise me. I dislike Doug Gilmour with a passion, but I must concede that he is extremely valuable to the Leafs.Alan

These guys have absolutely no concept of how to play in front of thedamn net!!!  Watch them in the offensive zone, especially on the powerplay. Damphousse or Lebeau will skate all over the bloody zone, maybe pass to thepoint, get it back, skate some more, pass it around....BUT WHERE'S THE SHOT??!Answer: the shot is totally useless because they lack a forward who standsin front of the net a la` Neely, Shanahan, Tocchet, etc etc.  Too bad Demers won't put Dipietro or LeClair on the powerplay more often.  Dammit,even Ewen would at least cause some disruptions.  Montreal desperately needsa power forward with some talent, IMO.Then watch them in their own zone. Patrick Roy is screened on everything. Saywhat you want about his performance; IMNSHO he cannot stop what he cannot see. And Montreal's defence does a miserable job of clearing the front of the net. Last night against Washington Roy played a *great* game.  The first goal cameon the most ridiculous goalmouth scramble I've seen in a long time, and hedidn't have a hope in hell of stopping the shot.  The second goal came on adeflection of a shot he only partially saw anyway.  Pathetic defence.  Thethird goal was EN.No wonder he gets pissed off at his defencemen.dchhabra@stpl.ists.ca

I never said that Murray was a bad GM.  I merely saidthat he isn't the best GM in hockey- or even a contender for that honor.If Murray is as great as you claim- the Wings would have won the Stanley Cupby now- probably more than once.  If he was as great a GM as you claimand he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligentenough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success.But Murray is an average (unspectacular) NHL coach and a pretty good GMso none of this is true anyway.Gregmeister

Yeah, Mario is good at drawing penalties,but wouldn't you try do something (you do claim to play) to give your teaman advantage?  I don't remember Lemieux getting any diving penalties thisyear, whereas many others did.  Finally, Mario has NEVER complained aboutbeing hit.  He knows it's part of the game; he gets back by dishing out aneven bigger hit to the same guy or just scoring a few goals (or settingthem up.)

Refs calls (especially last night) tended to favour Leafs.A couple of comments:1.  On Gilmour:  Just because the guy isn't one of the threestars doesn't mean he was not leading the team.  Someone postedthe playoff point total and he's in something like fifth or sixthplace....plus, he walked away with the Molson cup (given foraccumulating points from the three star selection) during theregular season.2.  On the officiating:  I've heard gripes from both ends on thisone.  Emotions are very high in this series;  the rivalry isone of the stronger ones I know of.  I do have to agree that theofficiating last night was pro-Leaf in general (except for whoevermissed that slash on Gilmour's hand).3.  In general:  I STILL think Detroit has one of the betterchances vs. Pittsburgh (though I think the Leafs would do betteragainst the Blues....but not as well if they made it out of thedivision). Problem is, I like both these teams, though I'msupporting the Leafs on the underdog principle.

He virtually stole games 1 and 3 for the Sabres.In both of these games, Fuhr stood on his head to give the Sabresthe chance to win. Especially in game 3, Fuhr made a series ofhuge stops in the third period when the score was tied 2-2. Even in game 2 when the Sabres won 4-0, the score seemed toindicate that the Sabres dominated. However, if it hadn't beenfor Fuhr, the Sabres wouldn't have been up (2-0 I think it was)through the 2nd period and the Bruins wouldn't have had to openup the game (thereby allowing Mogilny to score the third goal ona breakaway to salt away the game).  Thereis no doubt in my mind that Fuhr was the critical factor in thevictory. In my opinion, Neely, Oates and Juneau played as well asLaFontaine, Mogilny and Hawerchuk. The Sabres did getextraordinary efforts from Hannan, Sweeney, Wood, and Khmylev(compared to that of the Bruins checkers). However, the Bruins defense, IMO, played better than the Sabres defense (the Sabres have Ken Suttonplaying a regular shift afterall ;-)The difference in the series was Fuhr, who outplayed Andy Moog.

That was the bronze medal game in the SM-liiga which Tichonov's team Porin Assat (the Aces of town Pori:)lost.  Vasili, the son of Victor Tichonov (the famous Soviet coach),said that for a long time the Sharks have been persuading him totake the assistant coach post. But he wants to be the head coach whereever he goes. He definitely won't be coaching Assat anymore (afterthree? seasons). I don't know why.Vasili is a good coach I believe. Assat was a good team, produced manyplayers to our national team. Assat wasn't a skilled team (IMHO) butthey had the fighting spirit. After all, they butchered Jokerit in theplayoffs and gave hard time to TPS, the champs. But Assat wasn'tconsistent, only when they were in the right mood they could beat anyteam in the SM-liiga.I am not 100% sure about the deal with the Sharks. As I said, he wantsto be the head coach. But he and the Sharks are going to negotiate anddecide during the WC. I doubt that he will be the head coach butmaybe they'll do some compromise.Could somebody post more information about Vasili? I know he was coachingin the former Soviet league; teams, results? His character as a coach?

You see, the same rights Ali has to mail her letter to the NHLare the same ones that let you post replies that mow her down likewheat at harvest-time.  She never said she represented the entireinternet or the entire group rec.sport.hockey.  She has every right tostate her opinion along with those of the fifty or sixty orhundred-odd folk who've agreed to allow her to list their names on thebottom of it.  You may not agree with it.  Fine.  I really don't careenough about the name change to care.  Your name isn't attached to it,so why moan and complain?  If you felt her words were leading, well,you're free to feel that way and take exception, but manners neverhurt.  I personally disagree and feel her generalizations were fine(I have the right to think and say that, too).  Ali's under nocompunction to change a single word.  Now, while you're free todisagree with every word she wrote, to tear apart her character isuncalled for.  I'm posting this as a form of public reprimand.  If youtear down Ali's integrity and character publicly, you'll get chastisedpublicly in return.  Would it have been so hard to say, "Ali, pleasebe a bit more specific in your description, the way I've read itindicates you're stating my view also, and that's simply not true.I'd really like to see a disclaimer noting that you don't mean theentire internet or the entire r.s.h. group attached to it, despiteyour intent to list names at the bottom.  Thanks.  Cordially asalways," &c.  Calling her a moron and an asshole just reduces theweight of your words and the opinions of their author in the eyes ofmyself, and possibly others.  Oh, and Ali, nice to see someone standing up for something, even ifit's not something I personally advocate.  :-)-- Valerie Hammerl        John Sr. would lift Pat over the boards, grab hammerl@acsu.buffalo.edu       his hand, and start running around the outside,V085PWPZ@UBVMS.CC.BUFFALO.EDU  faster and faster.

While the exact details are not known, it is believed- to concern the Oiler's future.-- Rumour has it that Pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement- with Copps Collesium in Hamilton. During the press conference,- Pocklington may announce the deal. It is quite possible that- the deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands to- renegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium.-- Northlands has offered to buy the Oilers for $65 million earlier,- but the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington.-- As for me, my opinion is divided... Edmonton has been fairly- supportive of the Oilers. Even though they're a small market- team, they had many sellouts in the 80s. Even with the problems- that the team had this year, they still brought in more fans- than many teams in larger cities did. On the other hand, if- the team does move, there is no place more deserving than- Hamilton. Of course, how would that affect the grand- realignment scheme of Bettman?-  Following up on this, the provincial government has been asked by theOpposition to block any deal that Pocklington is offering to Hamilton.  Thegovernment said that Pock is going nowhere!  Why don't I believe the government?  Wasn't it Pocklington who wanted to beTory leader 9 years ago?Dave Shariff Yadallee (B.

It is updated each month and only information currently under discussion or of continuing importance or interest will be listed for more than two postings.  Boston Bruins  Boston legislators and the developers proposing a new Boston Garden finally agreed to a deal that puts the 19,000-seat, $160 million project back on track to be finished in September 1995.  Right wing Daniel Marois will be sidelined indefinitely following surgery to repair a herniated disc in his back.**  Sent defenseman Glen Murray to Providence of the American Hockey League. Buffalo Sabres1-800-333-PUCK (1-800-333-7825)  Acquired left winger Bob Errey from Pittsburgh for defenseman Mike Ramsey.**  Veteran Buffalo Sabres broadcaster Ted Darling will be inducted into the club's Hall of Fame Sunday, April 11.  Darling, who joined the expansion Sabres in 1970, was the team's play-by-play announcer on both television and radio until illness forced him out of the booth during last season.**  Recalled forwards Viktor Gordiouk and Doug MacDonald from Rochester of American Hockey League. Calgary Flames  Acquired veteran right wing Greg Paslawski from Philadelphia for future considerations.**  Recalled center Todd Harkins and left winger Tomas Forslund from Salt Lake City of International Hockey League. Chicago Blackhawks        The $175 million, privately financed United Center, scheduled to open in August 1994, will be home to the NBA's Chicago Bulls and NHL's Chicago Blackhawks. The stadium is owned by entities controlled by the two teams. The owners apparently still have not made a decision on whether the old Chicago Stadium will be razed for parking space once the new facility, located directly across the street, opens.  Suspended defenseman Craig Muni indefinitely for failing to report following a trade with Edmonton. Detroit Red Wings  Acquired defenseman Steve Konroyd from Hartford for a sixth-round draft pick.  Annnounced the signing of right wing Joe Frederick, their 13th pick in the 1989 National Hockey League entry draft.**  Two contrite hockey fans have returned the stolen Michigan Sports Hall of Fame plaque honoring Detroit Red Wing great Gordie Howe. The bronze plaque was stolen more than four years ago from Cobo Hall in Detroit, site of the Michigan Hall of Fame. Edmonton Oilers  Sent forward Esa Tikkanen to the New York Rangers for center Doug Weight.  Traded defenseman Craig Muni to Chicago for forward Mike Hudson.  NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said the Edmonton Oilers' lease with Northlands Coliseum must be improved if the team is to survive in the city. Edmonton Northlands is a non-profit agency set up by the city to administer exhibition facilities including the Coliseum.  Oilers owner Peter Pocklington calls his lease with Northlands horrendous and has threatened to move the team if he doesn't get a better deal. He makes no money from parking, concessions or building advertising. The 17,313-seat Coliseum also has few of the lucrative private boxes that produce significant revenues for other owners.  Announced center Kevin Todd will not need surgery but will miss the remainder of the season with a separated shoulder. Hartford Whalers  Sent defenseman Steve Konroyd to Detroit for a sixth-round draft pick.  Acquired left winger Robert Kron and a third-round draft pick from Vancouver for left winger Murray Craven and a fifth-round draft pick.**  The state of Connecticut will begin negotiations to buy the Civic Center from the city in an effort to keep the financially struggling Hartford Whalers franchise in the city. Los Angeles Kings  Sent center John McIntyre to the New York Rangers for defenseman Mark Hardy and Ottawa's fifth-round 1993 draft pick. Minnesota North Stars1-800-800-0435 if calling from the U.S.1-800-800-0458 if calling from Canada  The Dallas City Council has approved an agreement with the Minnesota North Stars that will bring the NHL club to Reunion Arena next season.  Defenseman Mark Tinordi, captain of the North Stars, will be sidelined the rest of the season, including any postseason games the North Stars might play, because of a broken collarbone.  Acquired defenseman Mark Osiecki from Winnipeg for ninth- and 10th-round draft picks in 1993.  Added defenseman Travis Richards from the University of Minnesota.  A former employee filed a sexual harassment suit against Minnesota North Star owner Norman Green. Karen (Kari) Dziedzic, Green's former executive assistant, claims Green often instructed her to wear cosmetics, described her outfits as "very hot" and "very sexy," once slapped her hand as she was about to eat and humiliated her by grabbing her hand and rubbing it through a client's hair.  The Minnesota North Stars, who will move to Dallas after this season, announced that nearly 11,000 season ticket reservations have been made for their new home at Reunion Arena, which has a capacity of 16,800.  The Met Center commission has told the Minnesota North Stars that it wants the club out - with its keys returned - at midnight after the last home game.  The club is moving to Dallas for next season.  The club must pay unpaid interest of $4,492.80 on the team's late rent payment for 1992, which was made earlier this month, and has been instructed not to take property such as the scoreboard and Zamboni ice-surfacing machine.**  Derian Hatcher's game-misconduct penalty was rescinded by the NHL, allowing the Minnesota defenseman to play in the North Stars' last two regular-season games.  Hatcher was given the penalty during a fight at the end of a loss at St. Louis on Sunday, April 11.  But the league didn't rescind the game-misconduct penalty Shane Churla received.  The Stars recalled center Cal McGowan from their top minor league club in Kalamazoo, Mich., to replace Churla. Montreal Canadiens  Acquired defenseman Rob Ramage from Tampa Bay for minor league defensemen Eric Charron and Alain Cote and future considerations.

Sent defenseman Rob Ramage to the Montreal Canadiens for minor league defensemen Eric Charron and Alain Cote and future considerations.**  Manon Rheaume's first starting appearance in goal for the Atlanta Knights was impressive enough for her coach to say she has a chance to be a backup goalie for another minor league team next season. Rheaume, the first female to play professional hockey, stopped 25 shots and gave up six goals against the Cincinnati Cyclones on Saturday night, April 10. After the game, her coach, Gene Ubriaco, said Rheaume performed well enough to compete for the No. 2 goalie spot with the Louisville IceHawks of the East Coast Hockey League next season. The Knights and the IceHawks are minor league clubs of the Tampa Bay Lightning.**  As their first season comes to a close, there are rumors swirling that the Tampa Bay Lightning just might become the Atlanta Lightning.  Or the Minnesota Lightning.  But they are just rumors, according to Lightning general manager Phil Esposito.  ESPN reported on Sunday, April 11, that the Lightning, who have been playing in 10,400-seat Expo Hall, are exploring opportunities to move to either Atlanta or Minneapolis.  But Esposito said there was no truth to the report.  "We were disappointed with ESPN's irresponsible comment," Esposito said.  "There is just no substance to the rumor." Rumors have been swirling for the past two years regarding a move by Tampa Bay, which is presently discussing plans to build a new arena. Toronto Maple Leafs**  Defenseman Matt Martin, who helped Maine win the 1993 NCAA hockey championship, gave up his final year of eligibility and signed a contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs.

Playoffs: The system will be conference-based, with the No. 1 team meeting the No. 8 team in the first round, No. 2 vs. No. 7, No. 3 vs. No. 6 and No. 4 vs. No. 5. Matchups will be based on overall points with the four division champions being placed in the first- or second-place seeds in each conference and being assured of home-ice in the first two playoff rounds. All series will be best of seven (2-2-1-1-1 rotation) except matchups between Central and Pacific teams.  Those series will rotate 2-3-2 to reduce travel.  In those cases, the team with the most regular-season points will choose whether to start the series at home or away.------ Draft news:        Under terms of the new expansion draft, which will be held in June, each of the 24 existing clubs will be allowed to protect one goaltender, five defensemen and nine forwards. The most recent expansion drafts allowed teams to protect two goalies and did not make a distinction between forwards and defensemen.        First-year pros only will be exempt from the draft, which is down from the two-year exemption teams had last season. San Jose, Tampa Bay and Ottawa still will be allowed to exempt second-year pros.        Each of the 24 teams will lose two players, with a maximum loss of one goaltender and a maximum loss of one defenseman. The one exception is that a team which loses a goaltender can then no longer lose a defenseman.        At the end of the first phase of the draft, the two new franchises will have three goaltenders, eight defensemen and 13 forwards for a total of 24 players. A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose, Tampa Bay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two new teams.        Ottawa, Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority drafting selection in the 1993 draft as long as they have the three worst records. Anaheim and Miami will choose no lower than fourth and fifth. The expansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose, Tampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions.        The two new teams will pick first and second in the 1994 Entry Draft, regardless of their finish in 1993-94. Should either of the two new teams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in 1994.        The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the 1995 draft in Winnipeg. The 1994 draft was scheduled for Boston, but a delay in the construction of a new arena required the draft be moved.----- - League news:Disputes:  The NHL owners and players have resolved differences over salary arbitration procedures, clearing the way for about 40 hearings.

The winner of the series earns the right to host the Memorial Cup, traditionally held in May.        The eventual OHL champion will also participate in the tourney.

Each team is owned by the league, with local interests controlling day to day operations. Each team has a $100,000 salary cap for 17 total players (16 dress up). Unlike the ECHL, players are not limited to three years in the league.  A Western Division may be added to the Central Hockey League for the 93-94 season if the plans of CHL president Ray Miron materialize.  Miron confirmed that El Paso, Amarillo, Tuscon, and Albuquerque are cities under consideration for the Western Division, which would play some interlocking games with the Eastern Division.  Meanwhile, San Antonio and Houston are close to being confirmed as the league's newest members.----- - Major League Hockey         A new hockey league with franchises throughout the United States and Canada will begin play in the fallof 1993, officials announced Wednesday, February 10.        Major League Hockey was founded by Roy Boe, former president of the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League and the New York/New Jersey Nets of the American and National Basketball associations.        According to Boe, the league will debut with six to eight teams playing a schedule of approximately 80 games. Franchise applications have been received from groups in Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, San Francisco, Saskatoon, Toronto and Worcester, Mass., Boe said.        Although the league will not raid existing leagues to stock its rosters, Boe said it will seek the ``world's finest hockey players.''        Boe said league play will have an international flair and discussed implementing some rules which are reminiscent of those of the IIHF.        ``We're removing the red line, moving the goal nets forward and eliminating all tie games,'' said Boe.        The MLH office will operate out of Stamford, Conn.----- - British Premier Division:  contacts:  Neil A.

Answers to some frequently asked questions:  Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs? A: Most of the team during the 40-50's was made up of people who lived in and around Montreal. Hence they were called "Les Habitants" (natives of Montreal). This was then shortened to the Habs.  Q: Why is the Montreal Canadiens logo a large C with an H within it? A: In 1914-15, the Canadiens logo consisted of C with an A within it to signify Club Athletique Canadien (CAC). The next year, CAC no longer existed and it was changed to what it is now to signify Club de Hockey. Q: What is the most informative hockey publication? A: The Hockey News is preferred by most North American hockey fans. It is a weekly journal with up-to-date info.Phone: 800-268-7793 (Canada and US)Phone/fax: 0483 776141 (UK and rest of Europe)  Q: How does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in the NHL? A: If X goals are scored, then the team gets credit for X goals in X+1 chances.  Q: How is +/- computed in the NHL? A: First, +/- only applies to skaters. Except for a power-play goal, when a goal is scored, each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a +, and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. Short-handed goals do count for +/-.  Q: What is the five-hole? A: The space between a goalie's pads. There are five major scoring zones: (1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower right, and (5) five-hole.  Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice? A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950's when two best-of-seven series were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a game, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice. Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game? A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever to play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for the expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis Blues.

Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout, but he barely brokea sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs frommounting any serious attack.Injuries:Pelle Eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh.Roster Moves:Jason Bowen was added to the lineup for his first NHL game. Jason was the FLYERSsecond pick in the first round (15th overall) of the 1992 entry draft. 19 yearsold, 6'4", 210 lbs. In 62 games with the tri-city Americans he had 10 goals,12 assists and 219 PIM. He plays left wing and defense, he played defense inthis game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use himup front as well.Andre Faust was returned to Hershey. He actually left after the second periodof the Kings game, flew to Albany, got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win,and played again for Hershey Sunday night.Lines:Fedyk-Lindros-RecchiBeranek-Brind'Amour-DineenLomakin-Butsayev-ConroyActon-BrownGalley-McGillYushkevich-CroninCarkner-HawgoodBowenTommy Soderstrom in goal.Acton replaced Lomakin in the 3rd period.Game Summary:If the FLYERS played like this every night, they'd be in the playoffs thisyear. The FLYERS hit everything that moved. They created scoring chance afterscoring chance. They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do.Jason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal.He had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone, but insteadof taking the shot he found Brind'Amour crashing the net on the other side.A perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa's body should have been agoal, but Puppa made a great save reading the play.Garry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance whenhe hooked Doug Gilmour at 4:25. The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killingunit was almost flawless the entire game, and set the tone on this kill. TheMaple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots, and the defense sweptaway every rebound.After the power play, the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play. Rod Brind'Amourgave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point, and he sent a drive at thenet. Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of JosefBeranek and Bob Rouse, who were wrestling in the slot. Beranek was able toget his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating intothe slot from the right circle, and he lifted a backhander over Puppa fora 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8:10.The FLYERS kept the pressure on, and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERSfrom building on their lead for a while. Eventually things settled down anddefense prevailed. Each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalieswere strong. Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners.Then Lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him, thought he hada chance to even the score. He had Foligno lined up at center ice, leaned intohim, and rode him into the center ice boards. The only problem was that Folignowas a little far from the boards, and Mike "Mister" McGeough felt that itwarranted a boarding call at 15:38The Leafs couldn't get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS werevery aggressive (for a change) on the kill.With time running out in the period, Recchi carried through the neutral zoneand handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf's blue line. They were ina crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun, Lindros tried a backhand passto Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi, but then Clarkchecked Recchi off the puck. Macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak andwent right to McGill who had manned the point. He drove it from just insidethe blue line. Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his owngoalie at 19:55.1. Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period.The FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuktripped up Rod Brind'Amour in his offensive zone. During the power play, theFLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Ericgloved it down, but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head. Wecould see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his gloveand the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. As time wasrunning out in the advantage, Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goalmouth but Puppa made the save. The rebound kicked back to the right corner whereRecchi picked it up, passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle,and Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55. With the assist, Recchi moves pastBobby Clarke's 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a FLYER at117.  Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points.Mike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance onthe power play. Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play witha slash at 9:19. Not much happened on the 4 on 4, although the Leafs had mostof the possession. The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play. Tempersflared a little at 13:14. Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors, Keith Actongot a bloody face. Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood ahooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. The replay showed that Hawgood'sstick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell.Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play, led by Dimitri Yushkevich.Bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson. Berehowskitried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. He had the puck at the point,and just trickled a pass down the slot. He made all the FLYERS look silly asnobody could get a stick on it, and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net,but Soderstrom stoned him.The FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didn'tget anything home. Shots were 13-10 FLYERS.The FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and theydecided that if Tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it alittle.The FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of theperiod, but couldn't get past Puppa. Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros makingroad kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros (unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill (roughing)all at 7:02. Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour.Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play.At about the 12 minute mark, Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his leftcircle that got through Soderstrom. The puck was rolling on it's side, andas luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towardsit (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or theother). Seconds later Rod Brind'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12:24 to give theLeafs another chance on the power play. On the advantage, after Soderstromstoned Andreychuk while lying down, Andreychuk got the rebound throughSoderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was sweptaway by one of his defensemen. They kept the pressure on, but Soderstrom wasequal and preserved the shutout.Recchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawlat 16:01. No punches thrown, Recchi got the initial minor, KrushelnyskiBaumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors. At 17:02 Rouse and Beranekexpressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing toset up another 4 on 4. Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERSzone as they were battling for the puck, and while McGill was down he ranhis stick across McGill's face. The FLYERS were not happy with that at all.5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski, and started throwing punches.Upward. Well, Al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. Each gota couple punches in before going down in a head, and Al got a standing O!Penalties: Eastwood 5 (cross check) + game, Clark, Carkner 10 each. Berehowskiand Conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17:49.So a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS. The had no interestin stting on the lead. Hawgood, Galley and Brind'Amour played catch untilHawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck andblasted it past Puppa at 18:39.That was all the fireworks, Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot. Puppadid, but kept the FLYERS off the board. 4-0 FLYERS, shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the3rd. Probably the strongest game I've seen from the FLYERS since the All Starbreak. Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom, all since 1/10. Tied for 2nd most inthe NHL, but he's played fewer games than Belfour (6) or the goalie I can'tremember that he's tied with.Next up it's the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannotbe eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an Islander win that nightin Washington would be the official end.FLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. Last year they had 75 pointsin 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6games to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is betterthan 5 under in 80).Tragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. The tragic number for 5this 5 points, I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home tolose 5-4 before I finished this up. Why 5 points instead of 4? Well, the FLYERSwill win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the Islanders win tiebreakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie. The Rangers could crumbledown the stretch as they play the Devils, the Pens twice, the FLYERS, andfinish up with 2 games against the Caps. So I guess 5th place could be thegoal for the team to focus on.FLYERS team record watch:Eric Lindros:38 goals, 29 assists, 67 points(rookie records)club record goals:club record points:Eric Lindros38 1992-93Dave Poulin76 1983-84Brian Propp34 1979-80Brian Propp75 1979-80Ron Flockhart33 1981-82Ron Flockhart72 1981-82Dave Poulin31 1983-84Eric Lindros67 1992-93Bill Barber30 1972-73Pelle Eklund66 1985-86Mark Recchi:51 goals, 66 assists, 117 points.club record goals:club record points:Reggie Leach61 1975-76Bobby Clarke119 1975-76Tim Kerr58 1985-86,86-87Mark Recchi117 1992-93Tim Kerr54 1983-84,84-85Bobby Clarke116 1974-75Mark Recchi51 1992-93Bill Barber112 1975-76Rick Macliesh50 1972-73Bobby Clarke104 1972-73Bill Barber50 1975-76Rick Macliesh100 1972-73Reggie Leach50 1979-80FLYERS career years:PlayerPointsBest Prior SeasonMark Recchi117113 (90-91 Penguins)Rod Brind'Amour7977 (91-92 FLYERS)Garry Galley5838 (84-85 Kings)Brent Fedyk5835 (90-91 Red Wings)That's all for now...pete clark jr - rsh FLYERS contact and mailing list owner

Though this is really unfair, since too much was expected of him. The second biggest disappointment is Melrose, with his adolescent handling of the goaltending problems.

Cap Citiesare currently working with cable companies to ensure a good start-upbase needed for a launch for any brand new cable service.The problem ESPN2 faces is the TCI-Cablevision connection in themerger of their Prime and SportsChannel networks. Prime SportsChannelwill try to wrestle away NHL from ESPN in the off-season. Also,TCIand Cablevision have control a large number of cable systems around thecountry with a total of 15 million subscribers. TCI-Cablevision willdo their best that ESPN2 never gets off the ground successfully. And theNHL's value will suddenly skyrocket in this cable war between Prime SCand ESPN. NHL is more vital to the survival of a regionalized PrimeSportsChannel since they virtually have no national major league sportscontracts and only cover local NHL/NBA/MLB sports teams.-PPV Mark

St.John's Nfld, CanadaDate: Tue, 20 Apr 1993 19:39:21 GMTHow long can the Leafs play short-handed and still be expected toscore?  They did some fine penely-killing in the first (2 men downfor a couple of minutes at one point) but they just couldn't keep it up.  They spent virtually the entire game either short-handed orjust coming off a penelty -- as soon as they'd get re-grouped, they'repenalized again! Sheesh -- like Gilmour said after the 1st -- you can't go calling every little push an shove in a game like that.  And if you're goingto, you have to do it for both teams. Pearson (one of my four favorite Leafs) played like a bonehead -- Isaw him personally screw up at least 2 good scoring opportunities, andthen he got that *bonehead* 5-minute major high-sticking penalty. Cullen has gotten stronger since his return from injury a hand-full ofgames ago and he played a good game.  If the other players on his linecan smarten up, that line should do okay.  Clark's got to get tough --he's got to intimidate and go for the net.  Send Clark up the left wing over the blue line a couple times... his patented wrist shot willput some numbers on the board... and Pearson... heck, maybe he shouldbe benched. I hate to repeat Grapes, but where the heck was Foligno?  Zezel can'tdo all the checking himself -- and get MacLlwain on the move... we need some speed out there!  Keep Potvin in net, he did okay considering... although (like I said a couple weeks ago) Potvin messed up in a couple games in the AHL playoffs last year -- he can easily do it again. My prediction last week was Toronto in 7 -- that the games DET wins will be blow-outs and the game TOR wins will be close -- I still standby that. Don't fret, Leafs fans, in order to win in 7, the other team has towin 3! :-) Burns is going to make some magic -- he'll mix up some lines.  Matchthe Wings line-per-line.  He'll have his team checking hard, and he'llnever let them get out-numbered in their own end.  The Leafs will winWednesday night... and will take 1 or their home games (probably thefirst one).

If he was as great a GM as you claimI think you missed one of my points there.  It takes *more* than a greatGM to win a stanley cup, even once.  Some of the guys on the list yougave earlier never won one.  I agree that you and I could probably argueback and forth for days to no avail about who is the best GM in hockey-that is a matter of opinion, and who is to say my opinion is any better than yours or yours than mine?  But the point of my *original* originalpost (if not well stated) was that Murray has the GM abilities but notthe coaching abilities.  Which leads to below:>and he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligent>enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success.I think at this point there's a personal, emotional element involved herewhich transcends Murray's logical thought.  As outsiders, it's fine for us to say, "He should hire a different coach."  In fact, he has talked aboutdoing so in the past.  But, the press (here in Detroit, at least) has sobuilt up this business about Murray never getting past the second round ofthe playoffs as a coach, that I think he has taken it upon himself to prove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the secondround.  He needs to, as the papers say, "get that monkey off his back."So it becomes a matter not of intelligence, but of pride.  Is it foolishto let pride stand in the way of sound logic?  Perhaps, but we're alla little that way from time to time.  I think eventually he'll step downfrom behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties, and the team willimprove as a result.I think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spenton GM work.  In that sense, once he steps down as coach, we'll see howgood of a GM he really is.>But Murray is an average (unspectacular) NHL coach and a pretty good GM>so none of this is true anyway.I may not agree with everything you've said, but it's been fun discussingit with you.>Gregmeister--Randy

North-ame-ricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks. An averageeuropean player from Sweden, Finland, Russian or Tsech/Slovakia is a better skater and  puckhandler than his NHL colleague. Especially defenders in NHLare mainly slow and clumsy. Sel{nne has also said that in the Finnish Sm-leaguegame is more based on skill than in NHL. In Finland he couldn't get so many breakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than inNHL. Also Alpo Suhonen said that in NHL Sel{nne's speed accentuates becauseof clumsy defensemen.I have to admit that the best players come from Canada, but those regularsaren't as skilful as regulars in the best european leagues. Also top europeansare in the same level as the best north-americans.(except Lemieux is in theclass of his own). Tommi

I do recall that the 1970 playoff picture wasn't decided untilthe final day, when the NY Rangers defeated the RedWings. The tie-breaker wasthe number of goals for (if I remember correctly), so the Rangers playedwith an empty net for the entire game. Some Hab loyalists accused the Wings of 'throwing' the game to keep them out, but as I recall, Gordie and Delvecchio had the flu, so coach Sid Abel sat them out,and the Rangers swarmed the RedWings most of the night.

It turns out that the mask iscustom-fit to the goalie's face.  The goalie puts his/her face through apiece of wood (or was it plastic?) with a hole in it that allows only the faceand forehead to show.  Hair is covered by a cap, eyes are covered by a plasticwrap-type material, and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face.  Then, aplaster is spread on their cheeks, forehead, and chin which takes about 12minutes to dry sufficiently.  When it dries, it is effectively a mold of thegoalie's face.  This is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involvespadding the inside, hardening the exterior, fitting the cage, etc. etc.  John Blue of the Bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show. >He exhibited a couple masks he is currently working on, namely, a>new mask for Andy Moog which is a basic re-working of his current>mask with the bear on it, and new mask for Bob Essensa which was >*really* cool -- the Jets logo was on the chin, and there were two>fighter jets on either side on the forehead with an air-brushed>back-ground.Yeah, Essensa's mask looked really good. >The best one of all was one he never talked about, he just held it up.>It has the current Leafs crest on the chin and an awesome looking >black panther on the forehead -- it *has* to be a new mask for Felix>Potvin, but he never said whose it was.Actually, I thought I heard him say that it _was_ Potvin's for certain.

I've also noticed that he usually gets away with it. Justas examples last night, I noticed him elbowing Scott Stevens in thehead, which basically started the whole shoving match that got Stevens(Scott) and Tocchet 2 minute minors. He also KICKED John McLean. Ofcourse he wasn't called for that. Isn't kicking an automatic matchpenalty and 10 game suspension? I think Glenn Anderson got one a fewyears ago for kicking Gaetan Duchesne in the chest. There's no doubt inmy mind that Barasso is the dirtiest golatender since Hextall. He's alsovery good.How about that Tocchet head-butt? Is there an automatic susppension thatgoes along with a (non-kicking) match penalty? I can't remember anymore.Oh, the playoffs should be fun,Ralph

For speaking for all those who didn't feel it was importantenough to say something themselves.  I wouldn't say that the letter clearly implies representation of theviews of a group that you belong to.  It represents a subset (that youdon't belong to) of a larger group (which you do, if only because thisisn't a moderated group).Look, there are several ways to state an opposing viewpoint.  Threethat come to mind are as follows:1) Say it subtly.  Result: it may not be clear.2) Say it directly yet politely.  Result: probably it will spark some    interesting conversation.3) Say it directly and obnoxiously.  Result: validity goes right out   the window.>I would agree that unwarranted use of said term is entirely immature.You realize that anything you say can, and most certainly will, beused against you.-- Paul W.

Stewart, being an ex-Nordique himself,>was looking to call penalties on the Habs while letting the Nords>get away with murder...WE WAS ROBBED!!!!No.  Patrick Roy is the reason the game was lost, and Ron Hextall is thereason Quebec won.  Everybody said it would come down to goaltending, thatgoaltending was the key, etc etc.  Well, the key doesn't quite fit if you'reMontreal.  The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call, but let's face it;he literally left his feet to throw an elbow.  Blaming Stewart is just anexcuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worstgoals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Besides,Stewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT.Montreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to cleartraffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more). Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than five, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.  But I don'tthink this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  Roy is paid big money to play.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.Demers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that, he should letthe damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe thisarticle, if possible.>Patrick Roy collapsed after letting in the tieing goal.

I also didn'tthink Scott Young should have gotten around the defender (can't remember who)in the first place.

How about Neely though?   Holy shit, what a player.Speaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.  I haven't seen ateam so potent on the rush in a long time.  Watching them break out of theirzone, especially Sundin, is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red Army.  But I still hate the team.On the rest of the games:  Didn't St. Louis' winning goal come on apowerplay?  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly, especially against Detroit. Same goes for Calgary; very, very undisciplined.  When Marty McSorely iswaving guys to the bench to *avoid* fights, you know something's up.  NewJersey was overmatched, Terreri's heroics notwithstanding.  Mario isunbelievable, and Jagr for some reason shows up in the playoffs.  But I hate that team anyway.dchhabra@stpl.ists.ca (pissed-off Habs fan)

That's bullshit. Anyone who would follow thePens or the Pirates in parts of the early eighties on a devoted basis arelosers. It's OK to follow and be concerned about your home team. Butto  give them respect even when it is clear the management and the players suckshould not be required of a true fan.A  true fan would follow the team introubled times to the extent that they could discuss how to improve the team.When I visit PIttsburgh, I'll refuse to go to a Pirates game since I thinkthe management has given PIttsburgh a team which could have been much bettereven if they couldn't sign Barry Bonds. Lert's say the Pens start doing totheir own team what the Oilers have done this year and what the Whalers havedone in recent years, I would be hard pressed to show much enthusiasm for theteam. I'll still follow it and bitch about it. But I won't waste mymoney on mediocre teams.-P{ravin Ratnam

They aretied for the third and fourth best defenses in the league, behindChicago first and Toronto second.  The Pens' weak spot is defense?

I feel that geographical names would enhance regional loyaltiesmore than names honouring personages.  And of course, they would not appearnearly as confusing to one approaching the sport for the first time.  Another thing that bothers me is the points system.  Percentages, as used inthe other major sports are clearly more informative.  When I look at theNHL standings the first thing I have to do is make a quick calculation toaccount for games in hand (which is almost always the case).  Some willobject to percentages, claiming perhaps, that it is an "Americanization"of the sport but I feel that using percentages is more informative andwhether it is "American" or not is irrelevant. >If the current names are inappropriate, then that is a separate issue, not >central to the original article.  Something to consider additionally is>whether or not players like Orr who 'contributed to the glory of the sport'>would have been able to do so _without_ an organized professional league to>play in.  In this case, honouring builders of the _league_ as opposed to>builders of the _sport_ becomes a chicken-and-egg type question. (although>it was the chicken.....)Even if Orr couldn't have contributed without the likes of Norris, you wouldhave to agree that Norris couldn't have contributed without the likes of Orr.And taking a poll of most fans would quickly tell you who the fans feel madethe more meaningful contribution.>>Exactly true.  Naming divisions and trophies after Smythe and the bunch>>is the same kind of nepotism that put Stein in the hall of fame.  I have>>always thought that this was nonsense.>Dunno if the Stein comparison is justifiable, since it doesn't look as though>his 'unanimous acceptance' to the Hall will hold up.It doesn't look as if the division names are going to hold up either does it?-- cordially, as always,                      maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca                                            "So many morons...rm                                                   ...and so little time."

I'll try to post the standings after "each game"(i.e. every two days).I managed to recover the email lost up to Saturday night, so all I'm missingis mail that arrived between early Saturday morning and Sunday afternoon.Many people re-sent their teams, so you may have received two replies backfrom me.  If your team name is not on this list, please resend your teamto me and I'll see what I can do.  Any kind of "proof" you sent it on theweekend will help your case.  :-)  Seriously, this is only a fun pool andI trust each person to be honest.Again, sorry for any inconvenience, and I hope the pool is still fun for you.- AndrewUSENET Hockey Playoff Draft StandingsPosnTeamPtsRemLast Posn1.Sneddon Scorers                 4325(--)2.The Borg                        4225(--)Dave Wessels                    4225(--)4.Bruce's Rented Mules            4125(--)Great Expectations              4125(--)Hurricane Andrew                4125(--)Jerky Boys                      4124(--)Homesick Hawaiian               4125(--)9.give you money monday           4025(--)Einstien's Punk Band            4025(--)11.Zipper Heads                    3925(--)Tapio Repo                      3925(--)Detroit Homeboy                 3925(--)the dead ducks                  3925(--)Mike Burger                     3925(--)Test Department                 3925(--)Team Elvis                      3925(--)Craig team                      3925(--)19.Skate or Die                    3825(--)Debbie Bowles                   3825(--)Fuzzfaces Galore                3825(--)suds                            3825(--)The Campi Machine               3825(--)zachmans wingers                3825(--)Sean Forbes                     3825(--)Threepeat                       3825(--)Flamming Senators               3825(--)Team Awesome                    3825(--)A.P.

And "valuable to his team" was not, and should notbe, considered synonymous with "best".  We are talking about a time whenhonour and attitude, not measurable skills, were the most important assetsa player brought to his team, his league and his sport.  This was beforethe onslaught of professionalism which has clearly denigrated what was formerly the foremost peacetime pursuit of glory.The Hart Trophy is not a prize.  It is an honour.-- cordially, as always,                      maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca                                            "So many morons...rm                                                 ...and so little time."
