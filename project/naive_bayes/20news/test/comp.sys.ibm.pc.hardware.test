Plus it offers a full range of resolutions, high refresh rates as well as unique proprietary performance features.  The card is available in both 16-bit ISA bus and 32-bit VESA Local bus versions (models 8500 AND 8500VL).        With 1MB DRAM on board, the WINDOWSVGA 24 card offers maximum resolution up to 1,280 x 1,024 and supports a refresh rate of 72Hz at 800 x 600 and resolution up to 1,024 x 768 non-interlaced. Both models provide performance many times greater than standard SVGA boards, yet conform to all current video standards.        WINDOWSVGA 24 features Genoa's FlickerFree(tm) technology, which eliminates screen flash and flicker to make viewing much more comfortable.  the cards also come with Safescan(tm), a utility developed by Genoa to eliminate the black border around the screen and thereby provide 100-percent screen use for overscanning monitors.        WINDOWSVGA model 8500VL takes full advantage of the speed offered by the new VESA Local bus technology.  Most VL bus cards will only handle data transfers up to 33MHz, but the 8500VL will transfer data at the full speed of the CPU, up to 50MHz.  Genoa is also offering this card in the "TurboBahn" combination packaged with their TURBOEXPRESS 486VL motherboard.        Built around the Cirrus Logic GD-5426 GUI accelerator, WINDOWSVGA 24 offers the user an exceptional price/performance value.  Genoa's advanced proprietary drivers act to "turbocharge" the chip, thereby providing an affordable accelerator card with power and performance that surpass many of the more highly priced chip cards.  The Genoa user will enjoy optimal speed and reliability for such programs as Windows, AutoCAD, AutoShade, 3D Studio, OS/2, OrCAD and more.  Driver updates and product bulletins are available on Genoa's BBS at (408) 943-1231.        Genoa Systems manufactures and markets an extensive line of graphics adapters, motherboards, audio and multimedia cards for IBM-compatible personal computers.  All products come with a two year limited warranty on parts and labor.  Genoa products are currently distributed worldwide through authorized distributors, resellers, VARs and systems integrators.

Is this correct?The reason is this - I have a Rombo Media Pro+ videodigitising card. It chroma keys its output into the vgamonitor signal. However, although it is supposed to workwith an ET-4000 with Hi-colour RAMDAC, the colours on screenbehave as if the top 2 bits of colour information are missing,and red, green, blue signals are swapped around.Rombo has suggested that this may be due to insufficientbuffering on the feature connector outputs, and is happy tosell me a buffer device for 50 pounds.I would rather save about 45 pounds, and build my own. I assumeit would require (for example) a 74F244 buffer IC (or two).Can anyone help? Any information on the feature connector wouldbe highly appreciated!Please could you reply by email :ee90dhg@brunel.ac.ukbecause I am at home (easter holidays) and a 300 baud modemis slow for reading news!

In your example, after accessing themodem, the mouse won't work until you reboot, because the IRQ is used bythe modem.> If Answer is NO, should I change IRQ's for com ports to be different?  And,> does it really matter which IRQ I set the ports too?Yes, you can change the IRQ's for com3/4, but it depends on your otherhardware. com1 uses IRQ4, com2 IRQ3.  If you have only one printerport ( IRQ7 ), you can change com3 to IRQ5 ( normally 2nd printer ). For com4,you can assign IRQ2, if its free. As far as I know, no other IRQ can beused until your I/O-card is 16bit and caould access IRQ's > 8.Michael--*  michael@jester.gun.de  *   Michael Gerhards   *   Preussenstrasse 59  *                          *  Germany 4040 Neuss  *  Voice: 49 2131 82238 *

The floppys have their own processor on their controllerboard which handles all of these commands.The difference between IDE and SCSI is that all SCSI peripherials areintelligent.  They each have their own controller.  They depend on theCPU to do fewer things for them, i.e. IDE drives needing a processorto transfer their data.>>Its a long story, but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which,>>thanks to SCSI, I can move between both machines.

Most SCSI cards willalso DMA the data into memory without the interupting the CPU, thereforeallowing it to continue working uninterupted.  IDE supports no such conceptas dettach/callback.

The specs I would like to have is:   * Applicable to Kodak multisession Photo-CD   * SCSI(2) Interface   * Compatible with Adaptec-1542B   * Does not need any caddies   * Cheaper ( < $500 if possible)   * Double Speeded  I believe there are no drives satisfying all of the above condition,  so I would like to know all of your opinion.  The above conditions  are sorted by my priority.  I think NEC CDR74-1/84-1 is a little bit expensive, but it DOES satisfy  almost all of the above conditions. The problem is that I do not know  the compatibility with 1542B. Has someone succeeded to connect these  NEC drives to 1542B? I have heard a rumor that NEC drive is incompatible  with 1542B adapter.  Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.Thanks in advance,Kobayashi,Masaoki(masaoki@tky.hp.com)

I have 2IDE and 1 SCSI on one system and the other with 2 IDE, 2 SCSI disk, and 1 SCSI CDROM.  I currently using ALWAYS IN2000 SCSI card, but I also havea Future Domain, a Western Digital SCSI card, and I work with an ADAPTIC before.  As I recall, all these cards can support boot and floppy drive.However, to use with other controller (IDE, MFM...) the boot drive has tobe the IDE (or MFM).  You CAN NOT boot from the SCSI if you have other controller in the system.  If you guys only have 2 drives (1 IDE, 1 SCSI).just set up the IDE in your CMOS setup.  Make sure you can boot from it.Then, set up the SCSI controller (IRQ, DMA, etc). Set the SCSI drive to ID 0.  Just plug and play for all the cards I seen so far.  Only if you have more than 2 drives then you need driver for the third drive and soon.  If you have more question, email me, I will try to answer it.Good Luck!William

(hardware) printer adapters have the ability to disable   the use of IRQ 7, usually by merely breaking the connection between   the ISA pin and the associated driver.  Other adapters control the   IRQ line by a tri-state driver, and by programming just leave it   in the high-impedence mode. - Unfortunately, there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate   drivers (i.e., either assert high or assert low) for the IRQ lines   rather than tristate drivers (assert high, assert low, or don't   assert anything).  The presence of such a card on an IRQ line precludes   the use of that IRQ by any other adapter unless it is physically    disconnected by a jumper.   (Incidentally, note that there's no requirement that a card hold   the IRQ line low when no interrupt is desired.  If that were true   you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected IRQ lines, and   that certainly isn't a requirement.) - Non-DOS operating systems (OS/2, NT (?), various Unices or whatever the   proper plural of Unix might be) require the use of IRQ 7 for performance   reasons.  And the SB16, alas, is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers.Joe Morris / MITRE  (jcmorris@mitre.org)

I want a standard allowing higher performance.- With SCSI, the OS can issue a request to the disk and then go ahead with other  things. Later, when the controller has performed the search and physical read,  data can be transferred to main memory at "RAM speeds". Not very relevant with  MS-DOS, but MS-DOS is not made for the future.- I've *got* a SCSI interface. I've got a 5.25" and a 3.5" floppy, too, and I am  not going to throw them out. With SCSI I may add, for all practical purposes,  an "unlimited" number of disk units without sacrificing any of my old disks. - For my PC, I've got a 300 Mbyte SCSI disk adopted from a SUN machine, and I  can carry it over to a Mac, a Sparcstation, an Alpha machine... whatever I like  to, if I decide to turn my back to the PC. (I *do* know that I cannot expect  to move the data without reformatting!)There are probably numerous other reasons for SCSI as well.>After all it is a floppy replacement we are taking about. 128Mb isnt all that>much, so it isnt going to replace the need of a fast fixed disk.No, not replace, but supplement. And contrary to a floppy, a MD may be fast enoughto run programs (or access data) directly off the MD. So we'll have much higherexpectations/demands, which is much better supported by SCSI than the old floppyinterface. And the price of SCSI controllers is not that high any more - isn't itsomething like a dozen large pizzas, nowadays? :-)ka.

It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it.There are THREE key differences in SCSI; the controller chip, the port, andthe software.  THAT IS IT.Let us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point.SCSI-1: asynchronous and synchronous modes {SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY} asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode {only 0-3MB/s vs. 0-5MB/s} synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi-1 divices with a rewrite of the software driver {As is the case for the Mac Quadra.}SCSI-2 {8-bit}: THIS is the main source for the confusion. This differs from SCSI-1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines.  In the Mac and some PCs this is called 'fast SCSI-1' because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the  slower asynchronous mode.  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode  4-6MB/s with 8MB/s{See in both Quadras and higher end PCs} Synchronous mode just allows a higher burst rate {10/MB/s}SCSI-2 {16-bit}: TWO versions-Wide/Fast.  Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2:  a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the machine and the external device. Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: SCSI-2 driver software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2. Speed of both is the same: 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst.SCSI-2 {32-bit}:  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI.  Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this requires: SCSI-2 driver software, wide SCSI-2 port, and that the RECIEVING devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip.  As expected this is VERY expencive.  Speed: 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s bursts As I said SIMPLE.  Seven versions of SCSI seperated by software, the controler chip, and the port. Standarize the SOFTWARE and it DROPS toonly FIVE versions of SCSI seperate by only HARDWARE {the chip and the port}

Nowhere do I seeanything like "after the bits are whipped of the platter at high speedthey sit around in a buffer to thaw before they are sent to the host"(even though I SWEAR that's whats happening ;->).  Here are some releventquotes from the manual:  "Data is transferred from the disk to the read buffer at a rate of   3.75 MB/s maximum, 1.87MB/s minimum."  (My calculations show 3121KB/sec   maximum and 1578KB/sec minimum...  disk spins at 4306 RPM with 87   sectors per track on the outside and 44 on the inside)  "Single burst errors of up to 24 bits within one sector can be corrected   'on-the-fly', in real time as they occur, allowing a high degree of   data integrity with no impact to the drive's performance."  (I take   this to mean error correction isn't the bottleneck)  "For page-mode operations, the data-transfer rate to and from the buffer   RAM is up to 10.0 MB/s. This high transfer rate allows the AT Interface   IC to communicate over the AT bus at a data-transfer rate of 5.0 MB/s,   while the DCS simultaneously controls disk-to-RAM transfers"                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^So the thing can even do it's cache pre-fetch WHILE it's sending therequested sector (it has 3 64KB read buffers for pre-fetching, I guessyou could call that a cache :-|).So when I do a sequential read on the outer tracks, WHY am I getting ameasly 862KB/sec when I should be getting around 3MB/sec???Any of you hard-disk engineers out there know?Wondering why my disks are so slow,  David                        o o--------------------oOO-(_)-OOo--------------------------------------------David Stam                            Linux: The choice of a GNU generationstam@netcom.com                       386-un*x-X11R5-Openlook-gcc-TeX-FREE!

These systems still have on-boardvideo and disk which are far better than the prior Value Point systems, andyou get VESA Local Bus for (future?) upgrades.  We are going to buy three ofthem with 17" monitors (also a newly available), and one of the three willimmediately be upgraded to UltraStor 34F caching SCSI disk controller andeither the ATI GUP or the Viper graphics board.Do not buy a 486SX sytem.My personal philosophy on upgrade policy is that it is not loss-free.  Whenyou earn money you pay taxes, when you spend money you pay taxes.  (i.e. theyget you coming and going).  Translated this means take infrequent but largesteps.  You are far better off short term AND long term if you avoid the SXmodels and go straight to the DX or DX-2 models.Gordon

I got it to work somehow but my Turbo>switch doesn't work at all.>I just put replaced the motherboard in a system and had similar questions.My 2 cents worth:The speaker connector should have two wires going to the speaker. A speaker being a coil, it's bidirectional and makes no differencewhich way you attach.Turbo switch.   There are three wires to control how you want turboto become active- with the switch pushed in or the switch out.    I thinkthe middle wire is common.   Use an ohm meter to figure out which wireconnects with the common wire when the switch is pushed in, and which twowires are connected when the switch is out.   Place the appropriatetwo wires on the turbo berg connector of the motherboard.LED's:   (Turbo and HD)  LED's are uni directional.  Depending whichway the wires are attached the LED will not light.  On my AMI motherboard,if the turbo switch wires are not attached to the berg connector on theboard, the board will power up in default in Turbo mode.   If your motherboardis like that... just attace the LED wires to the board.  If the LED doesn'tlight, power off, reverse the connectors and try again.   It should work.If it does, then attach the turbo switch to the board.Hope this helps.Dan MoyerDan.Moyer@ColumbiaSC.NCR.COM

Thefollowing are some of them:- Stack fault, by TC1024.DRV at address 0001:XXXX where XXXX is some  number. (TC1024.DRV is the VGA driver provided by the manufacture)- General protection fault, by ndw.exe at the same address- Segment load failure, by ndw.exe at same addressSome how, the address flagged was always 0001:something.

I tried commented out theTSR programs from autoexec.bat, no help.Is it something to do with the emm386 setup which is not tellingWIN31 what it suppose to know.

Every instruction should show some 'working',and not just alter register/memory/port contents. Does anyone know of any freely-available example simulation code,in Pascal or Modula-2, that would show me where I'm going wrongin writing my simulator? [I'm using Ayala's -The 8051 Microcontroller-as a reference - the simulator supplied with the package is overkillfor simple teaching purposes, I feel, and there's no source code to helpyou roll your own.] Please email me if you can help, or if you know of somewhere more appropriate I should be posting this  - I rarely scan these groups. Thanks, Lloyd WoodL.H.Wood@lut.ac.uk

You send a command to the port to read it, then you time how long    it takes for the joystick port to set a certain bit.  This time    is proportional to the joystick position.  Obviously, since time    is used as a position, you cannot get rid of this ridiculus waste     of time.

Many adds don't even mention the DX 50. Thanks a lot,   -Matt

I own an Adaptec 1542BSCSI card, and I have so far failed to get the CDROM to work under DOS.  Itworks very well under OS/2, so I know that the drive is not faulty.In my config.sys, I have aspi3dos.sys, aspidisk.sys, aspicd.sys.  In my autoexec.bat, I have MSCDEX, which came with DOS 6.0.  MSCDEX seems to findand install the drive as drive F:, but when I switch to that drive and try adir, I get an error message telling me the drive is not ready or somethinglike that.  The CDROM is locked too, and the adaptec utilities don't seem torecognize that I have a CDROM at that point.Has anyone ever had this problem?  Is there something abvious that Iam missing?  And finally, I was wondering if anyone using this setup could kindly post his/her config.sys and autoexec.bat.Thank you very much!******************************************************************************** imj1@cunixa.cc.columbia.edu    Imad "Hexabyte" Jureidini **     The Ultimate Knight, Grand Priest of the Secrets of the Undefined.      ********************************************************************************

I got the number forWestern Digital tech support and determined that I need to upgrade theBIOS to the Super BIOS.  It will handle hard drives with up to 16 read/write heads and up to 1024 cylinders.  The upgrade is $15, payable bycheck or money order.  Send to:Western Digital CorporationTechnical Support GroupP.O. Box 19665Irvine, CA  92713-9665The Super BIOS is for any WD XT hard drive controller card in theWD1002 series.The BIOS on my system would only handle up to 20mb drives.The responses to my request for help follow my .sig.

C.>As I said above, the drive is a Seagate ST-251.>The system is a Compaq Portable (circa 1985).     Ah, finally a question I can answer.   I mess with this olderstuff alot.   Kinda fun.  8)     First problem I can forsee is that the ST-251 will not becompadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios rom.      Check the numbers on it.  It should be the only non-smt chip onthe board.  Slightly below center, and left.    The bios should read either :     62-000042-015 or             62-000094-0x2     If the last 3 digits are 013, you got problems.>>Controller jumpers are set as follows: ("-" represents jumper)>W11-2 3>       W2      1-2 3>W31-2>W41 2-3>W51 2 3>W61-2 3>W71 2 3    Looks right.   W5 and W7 are factory jumped (with a trace) betweenpins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address.>The drive jumpers are as follows: ("8" represents jumper)    Looks right.  [art deleted]>Here are my questions:>>1.)Are the drive and controller compatible w/ each other?      I notice you left out the S1 jumper table settings.   Those arewhat control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you havethe 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this:              5 + +    open              6 + +    open                           7 + +    open                      8 + +    open              4 + +    closed              3 + +    closed              2 + +    open              1 + +    open    Note:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block.Top to bottom.   +'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 3,4, and 8select the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select thesecond drive (drive 1).         If you have the 62-000094 rom, it's a auto-config, and I'll haveto look up how to do it... I don't have the big book right here.>2.)Are the jumpers on the card/drive set correctly?      See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are notright.   Also,  at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cablesare on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251, try moving itto the opposite side of the drive.    It's one or the other.        The narrow data cable goes to J2.   I've thrown it on J3 a fewtimes and banged my head for a day.....>3.)Is my system's BIOS in need of an upgrade?     Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   A quick wayto check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter:               -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt)       This will return the rom date, if it's of any use.>Keith Rice      If I oversimplified any of the above, I appologize.     It'sjust hard to know what caliber of person I'm talking to. 8).                     -->   Bob Valentine  <--                    --> ravalent@mailbox.syr.edu <--  From chpp@unitrix.utr.ac.za Mon Apr  5 06:33:46 1993Received: from unitrix.utr.ac.za by ponder (5.61/1.36)id AA16194; Mon, 5 Apr 93 06:32:59 -0500Received: by unitrix.utr.ac.za (Smail3.1.28.1 #1)id m0nfpMA-0001X7C; Mon, 5 Apr 93 13:28 GMTMessage-Id: <m0nfpMA-0001X7C@unitrix.utr.ac.za>From: chpp@unitrix.utr.ac.za (Prof P.

NOTE 1:  AT&T 6300 - The AT&T 6300 and the AT&T 6300 PLUS           contain system BIOS chips that support the hard disk drive.            When using a Western Digital XT controller card the system will           not "boot."  To solve this problem, one of the ROM BIOS chips           must be disabled.  To disable the BIOS on your Western Digital            XT controller card, you must remove the jumper at position W-3           or add a jumper at position R-23 (depending on which model of XT           controller you are using).                                                 -2-                    NOTE 2:  TANDY 1000 SYSTEMS - The WD1002A-WX1, WD1004A-WX1,           WDXT-GEN2 and the WD1004-27X can be modified to operate in           Tandy 1000 series computers, models SX, TX and the original or           "A" version.  These computers utilize an interrupt of 2 (IRQ2)           instead of IRQ5, the IBM standard.  To modify the WD1002A-WX1 or           the WD1002-27X to operate in these systems, you must cut the           etch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position W-7.  Then           solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (W-7).  To complete the           modification, a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch S-1           (2 rows of 8 pins).  PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY PHYSICAL MODIFICATION           TO YOUR WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DISK CONTROLLER VOIDS THE WARRANTY           ON YOUR BOARD.  To modify the WD1004A-WX1, WDXT-GEN2 or the           WD1004-27X for your Tandy 1000 system, a zero ohm resister must           be soldered to jumper position W-27.  This will change the           interrupt from IRQ5 to IRQ2.

And I just got a 213MB IDE HD Maxtor that I wanted toadd as a slave drive. I did change the jumper settings on 213A Maxtor toconfigure it as slave drv, but I didn't change anything on my 42M WesternDig, since I didn't have any doc. on it. And as I predicted, It just beepedand gave me an error message about HDD controller.So, I had to take my 42M off & install my 213A to be my only HD. any help on this matter would be much appreciated.(before I trashed my 42MB) Thankx much Handy Trisakti - uc532838@mizzou1.missouri.edu

This is an interfacebetween a PC's parallel port and any video-recorder forbacking up your data on a videotape. The company (DataSave?)claims that it can store up to 7 GB on a 300 minutes tape.                         ^^^^^^^^^^It costs DM 250.- (about USD 200, I think)My question is: Does anybody use this product, if yes, how many bytes  REALLY fit on a 300 minutes tape (7 GB sounds quite unbelievable to me).

Windows makes all sorts of extra demands on hardware,and therefore your machine can't keep up with things.  Ever notice how whenacessing the floppies in Windows, everything else slows to a crawl?  I imagine your backup and evertyhing else that is running fights for CPU time,and sometimes the backup program loses.  Be glad.  I can't even run in medium speed with CP backup on my machine, supposedly because I have a SCSImachine which places extra demands on the data bus.don

ViewMatch color control which they claim is and easy-to-usesystem that adjusts colors to closely match printer output.  As near as I havebeen able to figure out, this translates to separate controls for red, green,and blue.

Reamy (mreamy@rock.concert.net)>The light at the end of the tunnel may be an oncoming dragon.One of the monitors I reviewed for the June issue of Windows Magazine wasthe Mitsubishi.  I also reviewed a new Nanao, the F550iW, which has justbeen released.  Last year for the May '92 issue of Windows, I reviewedseveral monitors, including the Nanao T560i.  There's no question that theNanao monitors are the best available this year, just as they were lastyear.  The difference between my ranking of the best in Windows and theranking in Windows Sources is due mainly to a difference in the testingcriteria and the scoring.  I used different tests than they did, and Iscored differently.  There's nothing wrong with the Mitsubishi, and itscored very highly in my tests, but it was a few points shy of perfect.Incidentally, one of the things everyone should do when they're readingreviews of any product, whether it's monitors or mice, is to read thecriteria and methodology carefully.  Unless you know how the producttesting was done, and on what the scores are based, you can't possiblyknow what they really mean.  Just seeing that I rank a monitor differentlyfrom Windows Sources is meaningless without knowing how we did theranking.

I don't have a comm program that cando precisely 14.4k.  I looked at the manual but it was unclear.  All I know is,I didn't have this trouble with the Intel--it cameready to connect this way.

It's 1024x768, up to 72hz atthat res, and it got a good write-up for image quality in a recent (Feb.?)issue of PC Magazine.  As far as I know, very little fully matches a NEC inimage quality (at least according to the mags -- I can't tell anydifference between the two!), but I think NEC is low emissions on only oneof the two types.  There's VLF (Very Low Frequency) and ELF (I think that'sExtremely Low Frequency).  The MPR-II standards set strict limits on both.But many comapnies, NEC included according to one article I read (I get abunch of mags so it's hard for me to remember which!), which claim "lowemissions" but not specifically "MPR-II Compliant" or "MPR-II Certified"only control for one, usually VLF, and ignore the other.So, the NEC probably has higher overall image quality (I consis-tently hear it rated as the best or close to the best), but not as lowemissions as the Hitachi.  I like my image quality, but for all I know youmay be more discerning.  Good luck!- Mitch v063kcbp@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu(Oh yeah: I got my Hitachi Superscan 15 from Insight for $499.)

Some softwareothers hardware orientated.. (Probably the wrong newsgroup .... as everyone claims..)Anyway..1) Does any one happen to have the board jumper details for a Trident 8900SVGA graphics card (1MB) or even what the dip switches do on the end.. Minealready works fine (albeit slow) and after having blown up a monitor I found out which switch controlled the interlace/non interlace facility.. But I'm curious as to why there are 8 dip switches on the card with apparantlylittle use..2) Secondly, does anyone know why Commodore had to be so crazed in their designof the PC-40 motherboard with respect to the RAM.. (IE 512 + 512 or 640 +0K) ??3) Can anyone supply pin details for the expansion ports for a pc (8 or 16 bit) .. or even a sample circuit to cause an irq when a button is pressed...(Yeah I know its a piece of cake.. I'm lazy 8)4) Software wise.. Anyone care to divulge some tips on accessing expanded RAMon a PC (from a program written in Turbo C++).... For instance, using farcoreleft() and coreleft() return only memory availablefrom the base 640K regardless of combinations of EMM386 etc etc...What I want is to be able to use the RAM above and beyond the 1MB boundary...I'm not certain whether farmalloc / new actually uses it anyway but I'll suspect not .. 5) Also.. what half brained wit created DOS so as not to be re-entrant??????   As a follow on, does anyone have any comments about the use of DOS calls   0 to 0C from within a DOS interrupt? Ie will changing the stack size on   entry be of use.. Two articles I've read on the subject have given    conflicting views... Does anyone have any views on writing direct to   screen memory in terms of portability?Many thanks..Gotta go, bars closing soon 8)CheersIan

Some BIOSes do not automatically install COM3 or COM4 in the port tables. Programs like most modem programs which write directly to the port work fine but anything that uses a BIOS call fails. Find a BBS or FTP site where you can get a copy of PORT FINDER. Put "device=pf.sys" in your config.sys or run pf.com from your autoexec.bat. This little program will locate all existing ports and make sure the BIOS tables are updated. It works great.

This frees theSCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS tostart transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data thebus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices areready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data.On an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seekedthe data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for otherprocesses wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time.> > Also, I'm still trying to track down a copy of IBM's AT reference book,> but from their PC technical manual (page 2-93):> > "The (FDD) adapter is buffered on the I.O bus and uses the System Board> direct memory access (DMA) for record data transfers."> I expect to see something similar for the PC-AT HDD adapter.  > So the lowly low-density original PC FDD card used DMA and the PC-AT> HDD controller doesn't!?!?

They will continue to service interrupts, etc.,etc.  The clock will always be running at n Mhz no matterwhat it's doing.I suppose depending on the instruction, the CPU may usecircuitry which has more transistors than otherinstructions, but if you consider the additional heatgenerated by only a handful of additional, tiny resistorsand then spread that heat dissipation over the CPU'spackaging, the change in temperature to the immediateenvironment (ie. the surface of the package) will benegligible.Cheers, Ben------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ben J.

Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card  expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Normal {asynchronous} SCSI is 5 Mhz;  fast {synchronous} SCSI is 10 Mhz.  Difference between these modes is mainly in the software drivers. Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal  terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port  {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. SCSI-1:  8-bit; 7 devices per SCSI controller.  asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave} and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  8-bit SCSI-2 is often mistaken for a fast version of SCSI-1 {see SCSI-2 for details}.SCSI-2: fully SCSI-1 compliant. SCSI-2 mode - 10 devices per SCSI controller. 8-bit SCSI-2 is implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it can run using SCSI-1 hardware and software drivers which limits it to 7 devices, which results in it sometimes being mistakenly consitered part of SCSI-1.  16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require different ports, electronics, and SCSI software drivers from SCSI-1 {Which makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}.  32-bit SCSI seems to run only in synchronous mode, hence term 'wide and fast SCSI' Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit}.8-bit SCSI-2 is the BIGGEST headache due to the fact that it is the ONLY SCSI-2 that I know of that can pump SCSI-2 speeds through SCSI-1 devices and softwarecontrolers.  Its MAIN implimentation is on the Mac though you do see addsfor SCSI-2 at 10MB/s maximum throughput for PCs.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 does NOTNEED all the hardware {including electonics} and software of 16-bit and 32-bitSCSI-2 it is the CHEEPEST of the SCSI-2 interfaces.  Just pop out the SCSI-1electornics and pop in 8-bit SCSI-2 electronics.  Some people consider16-bit where SCSI-2 REALLY starts {I USED to be one of them} but4-6MB/s average though put with a theoretical burst of 10MB/s is NOT SCSI-1but is 8-bit SCSI-2.Rule of thumb: if it is SCSIn and OVER 5MB/s then it is SOME type of SCSI-2.8-bit SCSI CAN use part of SCSI-1 electronics which further reduces its costcompared to 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2.

Software drivers often allow for betterperformance, though. You have to use them if you want to use otherdevices besides hard disks or have more than 2 disks.>Will this also be true of the 32-bit OS's?Obviously these are not able to use the 16-bit real mode BIOSes thatare written for DOS, so you need software drivers.

So    unless the first BIOS 'get date' call after midnight is done by    the DOS 'kernel' (which is the only part of DOS which knows how to    increment the date, the day wrap indication is normally lost.My guess is that Kevin's 'menu' system uses BIOS calls to read theclock (in order to display the time), and is hence the entity whichcauses the day wrap indication to get lost. Even if the 'menu' system'notices' the day 'wrap' (which I think is indicated by a non-zerovalue in AL), there really isn't any particularly good way to tell DOSabout it, so that DOS can update the day. The menu system 'should' useDOS calls to get the time, which would cause the DOS 'kernel' to dothe BIOS call, and the wrap indicator would hence be processedproperly.  Possibly, though, the 'menu' system can't easily use DOScalls for time, because DOS is not reentrant, and perhaps timeincrementing ofters occur while the 'menu' system is 'inside' someother DOS call.Wally Bass

The opinions expressed are those              of the user and not necessarily those of Oracle.Lines: 27Hello,I have a 486sx25 ISA machine with Pheonix BIOS.  Currently I have  8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie.  both banks are full, and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinking  of running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows, and I know  that more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS, the only solution I  can see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about  $400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now,  the entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that  the machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather  avoid...So my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work  well with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about  $90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, how  do they do it?  Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup the  extra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the  ISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits, so  probably all of this is just wishful thinking... However any help is truly  appreciated.-Ericebosco@us.oracle.com

My>computer is a DTK 286-12 IBM clone.Running MS-DOS or a derivative OS, obviously. Please take note that thefollowing is not what exactly happens, but a slightly simplifiedexplanation.Technically, the IRQ line is only a means for the device (printeradapter, SoundBlaster, modem, hard disk, ...) to signal the CPU that"Something's happening here, please take note." How the CPU isprogrammed to handle this signal is usually up to the operating system.In MS-DOS, the "interrupt vector" is used to store the address of thefunction that handles each interrupt.Now, basic DOS doesn't care whether the printer reports that it's readyto print some more stuff or not - it simply ignores the interrupt.  WhenDOS prints, it looks at the LPT buffer.  If there's a character there,wait a while and check again.  If there's not, copy a new character tothe LPT port.  Since the IRQ 7 is ignored as a printer interrupt, it'sfree for use for any other adapters - in this case, the SB. With any multitasking or otherwise advanced OS, this kind of printingapproach just doesn't work (or more precisely, it wastes a lot of CPUcycles.) Hence, you can't "share" the IRQ 7 with LPT1 and SB if you'rerunning Unix or OS/2 or whatnot.Another issue with the SB is that only the digitized sound usesinterrupts. When the SB plays plain music, the CPU simply tells it whatto play until told otherwise. With digitized sound the interrupt isrequired to notify the CPU when the output ends and new data isneeded.You can, however, hook two (or more) COM ports to one interrupt, but usethem only one at a time.  This is because the interrupt handling routineis same for both ports, and it can see from which port the data camefrom. This, of course, applies for some other devices (like LPT) as well.Remember, this was greatly simplified in parts, but I think gives thegeneral picture correctly enough.Cheers,--                Juha Liukkonen, aka jliukkon@cc.helsinki.fi              University of Helsinki,  Dept. of  Lost Souls           "Trust me, I know what I'm doing." - Sledge Hammer

I've also identified that when the machine boots (and the drive seeks for a boot disk), the head movement during this process is now approximately half the length of the original time.

Do people forget that the IDE was specificallydesigned to interface directly with the AT ISA bus? We've seenIDEs come out for EISA, XT ISA, and now even MCA, but at all timesit was a 16 bit standard, running at somewhere near 8-10 Mhz. Whenyou run an IDE off of the VLB, there's no way that you're running itat 33 Mhz, it would burn up. Of course same goes for SCSI, ESDI, whatever,none of them run at CPU speed.The only way to gain advantage with a VLB IDE is to hook it up toa caching controller. I suspect it would be much, much better toget a software disk cache instead, since you get write-caching as well.>because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big.I've seen some Fuji IDE drives going as high as 1G.Yousuf Khan

I'm not sureif the Sportster line is fully DSP driven like the (more recent) Couriermodems are, so upgrades in the future may be an issue.again, take all of the above with a grain of salt...I've never evaluatedthe Sportster, so I'm going by bits and pieces that I've heard.  if youwant a real answer, post the question in comp.dcom.modems and you'll findpeople who HAVE worked with the Sportster.personally, though, if I were going to look at the Courier modems, I'dbuy the Dual Standard...then I'd get both HST and V.32bis.  in fact, thisis exactly what I did.  :-)  I'm sitting here looking at my USR DS rightnow.and now, to correct a few VERY incorrect statements....  folks, if you wantto get reliable answers to modem and/or UART questions, post them tocomp.dcom.modems.  if you post in other groups, you never know what you'llget in the way of an answer (you may very well get a good answer...or youmay get something like the one below).  at least in cdm, if someone postscomplete and utter bs, you'll see a flurry of folks correcting them (toavoid spreading faulty info).>The Sportster at 14.4 has v.42 error control and v.42 bis data compression.just as it does at lower speeds, too.  there is absolutely nothing ineither CCITT Recommendation V.42 or V.42bis that says that they can onlyoperate on modems that are running V.32bis.  V.42bis, of course, iscurrently only *STANDARDIZED* for operation on top of V.42 (in its primarymode of operation, LAPM), but that's about as far as that goes.and just in case there's some confusion on this, V.42/V.42bis are alsosupported by the Courier line (unless you have a really ancient one).>The difference>with the Courier, is that it can run at 16.8 and only in the HST mode. take a second look at the original question:>In a previous article, cs3sd3ae@maccs.mcmaster.ca (Holly       KS) says:>>What is the difference between the US Robotics Courier v32bis external                                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^see the V.32bis up there?  the question was not about the Courier HSTmodem, or about the Courier Dual Standard...it was about the CourierV.32bis modem.  the modem in question does not support HST, period.  ittherefore does not support the 16.8 kb HST.also, not all Courier HST / Courier Dual Standard modems support the 16.8 kbversion of HST.  my Dual Standard only supports HST at 14.4 kb.  there areeven older models that only run HST at 9.6 kb.>This is a proprietary mode of USR and it will only connect to another of>the same type unit to achieve this speed.HST is USR's proprietary modulation scheme....  but we're not talking aboutHST, we're talking about V.32bis.  V.32bis is most definitely *NOT* aproprietary modulation scheme.>The Sportster will do>asynchronous transmissions as well as synchronous.  The HST is one way>only.I do hope you didn't mean for these two sentences to be related in someway.....first off, V.32 and V.32bis are both synchronous and asynchronous.  this ispart of the CCITT Recommendation (i.e., part of the standard).  it isn't afeature unique to the Sportster (I just looked at the appropriate chapterin the Courier DS manual).second, HST is not ``one way only.''  more correctly put, it is anasymmetrical modulation scheme, meaning it doesn't work at the same speedin both directions.  HST operates at [9.6 / 14.4 / 16.8] in one direction,and has a low-speed back-channel in the other direction.  the high-speedchannel goes in the direction of the higher data flow.  this is fine ifyou're logged on to say, a BBS, and type one letter and get screens ofinfo back, transfer files (not using bimodem), etc....  there is, of course,a penalty for turnaround time when the high-speed channel needs to reversedirections.V.32 and V.32bis are both symmetrical, meaning they do transfer the fulldata rate in both directions at the same time.third, synchronous vs asynchronous has absolutely nothing to do withsymmetrical vs asymmetrical...they are two completely different topics.>The HST's will be upgradeable to the v.fast spec when it is available.again, more correctly put, *SOME* of the Courier line will be upgradeableto whatever ``V.fast'' is called when it's complete.  if you have the largefootprint Courier modems (like I do), you're S.O.L.....  there was anupgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety, whichcould eventually be upgraded to support V.fast, but the cost of the twoupgrades together pretty much put it higher than just buying a new modem.later.....   --jim--#include <std_disclaimer.h>                                 73 DE N5IAL (/4)------------------------------------------------------------------------------INTERNET: jim@n5ial.mythical.com  |  j.graham@ieee.org     ICBM: 30.23N 86.32WAMATEUR RADIO: n5ial@w4zbb (Ft.

That's 100% of the people I know with DOS 6.0. Both havehad to reformat their disks and start over.  One had drive D compress and workfine, only to compress C: to have the thing choke, spit out an unintelligablewarning, and then hang.  All that was left on either drive was autoexec.batand config.sys.  Calls to Microsoft only met with busy signals.  After reformattingthe drive, I'm not sure if he had the guts to reinstall 6.0 or stay with a knownentity.The other may have been a marginal drive, however, his upgrade failed,he had to format a floppy disk at 6.0, format the drive, and then reinstall.I make now claims since I was not driving at the time, however, be carefuland make sure you back important things up.I am interested in any other people with similar or success stories.....

Remember: those 21 Mb disks that look and feel like 3.5" floppies? These drives: are SCSI devices and can read and write both 720 Kb and 1.44/21 Mb: disks. Sounds to me to be one great product for the PC market. Are the: prices really that unaffordable compared to CD-ROMs which are currently: not rewritable? I know about the new rewritable CDs and expect SONY to: develop the first MDs for the computer. My question is: why isn't there: any substantial interest in developing the flopticals?Certainly in the UK the 21Mb flopticals are about the same price as acheap CD-ROM now (you seem to be able to get them for around GBP200-250). However the bigger optical drives (e.g. 128Mb) are much moreexpensive - around the GBP 1000 mark.A couple of questions that someone may be able to answer - the 21Mbflopticals - are they direct drop in replacements for a floppy or dothey need driver software etc. I.e. do you just rip out the floppydrive, plug the same cables into the floptical, stick in a flopti-diskand hey presto you have a 21Mb floppy. This sounds far too easy.On the subject of Sony developing MDs for computers, I have reread aPCW article on this subject and there it says that Sony have been doingoptical drives for other people for some time and may be about to do aproduct themselves. From the article it seems that the audio MD formatis a byproduct of their computer storage work - the MD  mechanism isidentical to their MO computer optical drives. A Sony spokesman wasquoted as saying that a 2.5" MD disk would hold about 100Mb of datathough he refused to comment on any possibility of this beingproductized.The article said that one of the problems holding back development inthis area was lack of sensible standards plus there are at least 2distinct optical storage mechanisms around at present. Given that itprobably needs MDs being used as a distribution medium to get itinto the market and since this has already been cornered by CDs itprobably needs someone to come in with a very strong marketting leadto get MDs accepted.----------------------------------------------------------------------------david shepherd: des@inmos.co.uk                     tel: 0454-616616 x 625                inmos ltd, 1000 aztec west, almondsbury, bristol, bs12 4sq"They didn't like the rates, they don't like the poll tax, and they won't like the council tax."   - Nicholas Ridley

I would liketo know, if there are any other such jumpers and possibly where they are located.Problem 2:My hard disks refuse to boot. With my two SCSI HD's (Rodime, Miniscribe)I get a message 'Missing operating system', even though the disks have beenformatted with the same controller and they damn sure have an operatingsystem on them. If I boot from a Quantum I might get as far as gettingthe MS-DOS version information. This might of course be due to incombatiblememory drivers.Are there any jumpers that could affect the HD causing such errors?Thanks in advance        Jouni_______________________________________________________________________________Jouni Marttila - Yo-kyl{ 11 B 25,  20540 Turku,  FINLAND - +358 21 374624____jmarttila@abo.fi - jmarttila@finabo - abovax::jmarttila - jjmartti@utu.fi__PGP-key available via finger jmarttila@abo.fi ___________________________

An update to the chipset may begat an update to the motherboard board design.What I'm saing is:  The motherboard manufacturer seems to be passing thisoff as a simple fix.  In my mind the fix is a updated chipset from HINT along with a possible motherboard layout update.  This is not simple.If I were you I would be cautious about this.You might look into the Advanced Integration Research (AIR) VL/EISAmotherboard.  All slots are EISA/ISA capable.  2 (or 3) of the slots areVL-bus capable.  The AIR people confirmed this board supports 'real'32-bit EISA DMA (I called them).  Pentium/P5 (?) capable.  Less expensivethan equivalent AMI or Micronics VL/EISA board.Look in Computer Shopper (April '93).  The ZENON ads show the AIR mother-board.  A associate bought the AIR board and is pleased with it.

As you can wellimagine, I got nearly one hundred responses, so I figured I'd thankyou all here instead of individually.The tallies:I got one vote for A/UX, which runs on the Macintosh.I got several nays for Commodore's 3000UX system.Most people agreed that SGI's were nice, and very very expensive.Some (devoted) Sun users nearly insisted that I try to find a usedSun, say a 3/60 or 3/80.About a dozen people told me how they love their NeXT...only now NeXTis out of the hardware business (see below).And most of the other 85+ people said:  Get a 486 box, and run someversion of Unix that's available either in the Public Domain orcommercially.=============And so I weighed my options.  What stood out, in my opinion, was thatthere were several different versions of Unix available on one system:the 486 (PC) architecture.  If I bought a Sun, I'd have to use SunOS.If I bought a (used) NeXT, I'd have to use NeXTSTEP (see below).  Adnauseum.But with a PC, I can run Linux, which is a small user-friendly (?)flavor that uses shared libraries to cut down on volume, although Ihear its networking abilities aren't up to speed with 386bsd, anotherPD (==free) port (which takes up a lot more space).  I can purchaseBSD386 (commercial product) if I choose.  There are several othercommercial packages available.So, what I've found out (after pricing systems, etc.), is that I canget a really good Unix workstation for as little as ~$2500.  Includingsource code!Or, for ~$3500-4000, I can get an unbelievable EISA bus 486-66DX2system, fully blown, and run single user BSD386.What I'm really excited about, though, is NEXTSTEP for Intel.  NeXTchanged into a software company only, and they are releasing their OSfor PC's.  I've used NeXT's before, and I absolutely loved them.Everyone who wrote me about NeXT (or NEXTSTEP) commented on thedeveloper's environment, and how well designed the whole package is.===========So, my choice is to:1)  Wait for the mail on Monday, so I can read what NEXTSTEP's systemrequirements are2)  If I'm wowed on what they say, I'll buy a system that fits intotheir criteria    2a)  Get NEXTSTEP3)  If I'm wowed, but I can't afford it yet (most likely), I'll buy asystem that fits their criteria    3a)  Get Linux or 386bsd, as a temporary learning experience so Ican save up for NEXTSTEP4)  If I'm not sufficiently wowed (least likely), I'll buy a systemthat is slightly less blown out (like a 486DX 25, ISA) and put Linuxor 386bsd on it.================Again, thanks to everyone around the net.

It has 4 NS16550AN chips in sockets, and 4 correspondingconnecters labeled COM1 - COM4.  There is also an external female connectorwith 37 pins.  There are 8 banks of 8 switches, 2 banks of 4 switches, and7 jumpers.  I believe that I have determined, by following traces, thatSW5 and SW6 (12 switches in all) control the interrupt level for each ofthe COM ports.  SW5[1-4] are for IRQ3, SW5[5-8] are for IRQ4, and SW6[1-4]are for IRQ5.  The other switches are beyond my meager ability to follow.     The only identification printed on the board is "MULTI SERIAL PORT BOARD"across the bottom.  There is a box for serial number, but it is blank.Immediately below the words "SERIAL NO", but not in the box left forthe S/N, are the numbers "1990 2 8".Anyone have any clues?

I just bought the new soundblaster 16 and tried to install the card. The sb16 uses 16bit DMA channel.I couldselect between channel 5 to 7. It is the first card I everinstalled that uses 16bit dma transfer. After I testedthe card the first time, the computer crashed and I got aparity error-system halted. This happens either from dos asalso from windows. So it seems that my 16 bit dma channelsare not working properly (they are there because testsb16.exerecocnize them and tests them ok until first access). Well, does anybody know a solution for this problem or aspecial test program for dma problems? I eliminated the problem temporaly by using only 8 bit dma channel but itmakes the system slow!Thanks for your help.Yours Markus

VESA-compliant applications should have no troublesetting these modes. (But I'm forwarding your posting to our Software group,just in case.  Can't be too careful.)  Not that I doubt that YOUR applicationsare failing to run; lots of stuff depends on figuring out which exact SVGAthey're looking at, and don't use VESA calls (VESA is still pretty new).Every new chip set confuses them.>The supported resolutions really annoy me.

We need tofix the problems you've noted (they were already on the list).  Ifyou're really interested, though, take a look at the text fileP9000RES.DAT, which holds the data from which the choices in theP9000 monitor installation program are built.  Working by analogy,you can build up a new monitor definition that has the rightcombinations of refresh rates for your monitors.  Keep a backup copyof the file!  Once you've built a new version of the P9000RES.DATfile, run the P9000 installation program, INST, and your new choicesshould show up.  (This assumes you have the WEITEK v. 2.2 drivers.You can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time ofthe driver: 02:20 is version 2.20.

So I'd take thenumbers with a ton of salt. (Texas Instruments did the same thingwith WINTACH, trying to make the 34020 look good compared to the8514, as if anyone cared.)  It's safer (though not safe) to usebenchmarks from "unbiased" sources, such as testing labs, columnists,etc.>Interestingly, the solid>vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie,>filled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.

What's kind of silly is IIT'suse of a hardwired "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog thensat on a tack" string in their driver.  Not only is it useless inreal applications, it lacks the programming elegance of the "BartSimpson optimization," in which you save the bitmap of themost-recently drawn string in off-screen memory, and just do ascreen-to-screen bitblit if you happen to be given that same string asecond time in a row.  (We call it the "Bart Simpson optimization"because Bart's the only person we can see benefiting from it: hecould right "I will not cheat on benchmarks" a hundred times and bedone in half the time it would take to actually form each character.)>I make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.

For example, if your Soundblaster wantsto drive interrupt number 7, then it must hold a certain bus wire to 0or 1 at all times, depending on whether or not it wants an interrupt.This precludes letting another card assert interrupt number 7.When two or more devices in an ISA bus PC share an interrupt, it'sbecause they're implemented by a single card.  -=- Andrew Klossner  (andrew@frip.wv.tek.com)

Mymachine (4DX2-66V) this past Friday. This was two weeks to the DAY fromwhen I called the order in.    Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the peripherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). Iwas very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway documentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals.The Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP camewith build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office)was properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and has been performing flawlessly. It's been on all weekend and it hardlyeven reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a lot to do with it.    It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read aboutsome people having problems with high speed serial communications. I used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my oldcomputer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then "maps" the othermachines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can "cd" to thesedrives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like apeer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine.It's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and thismachine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the peer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive.   My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I alsoby-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430credit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!  So, I'm glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I'm glad itwas me. (Now if it just KEEPS working). :-)John-- John Gayman, WA3WBU UUCP: uunet!wa3wbu!johnPacket: WA3WBU @ WB3EAH

I can't speak for MAG Innovision but as far as NEC is concerned, they areadjusted to "factory-spec" before leaving the central USA distribution point(MA) for the eastern Canadian market. Now, here's the key: NEC *knows* thatthe >=15" monitors' adjustments are very sensitive to shipping overdistances (with all the bumps, rough handling, and such) and therefore*expect* and (at least in theory) *require* that the local *distributor*(not dealer) have it adjusted at the *local* service centre (Bull HNInformation Systems in Toronto) before sale. This is the correct andprobably only way of having any chance of receiving a "perfect" monitor(the definition of "perfect" seems to depend on how picky one is, in mycase quite :).>Are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections?I, for one, was not willing to accept what I considered a substandardmonitor and, after two months of wrangling and direct contact with NEC,finally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor (not perfect, IMHO,but a major improvement over what the dealer and distributor were tryingconvince me was "normal"). The short answer is no, don't accept these"imperfections" as "normal" because for the premium one pays for thelarger screen monitors, one has a right to expect higher quality, andif you're persistent, you'll receive it.>...............................................................>:      Comments and opinions are mine - not BNR's             :>: Doug Adcock                      adcock@bnr.ca              :>: Bell-Northern Research           Research Triangle Park, NC :>...............................................................Regards,Paul Yeeyee@nimios.eng.mcmaster.ca

I've put together a list andindicated what I think each item is worth.  This is just my estimate, and Iam very open to any offers, including trades.  I'm currently looking forsome CD-ROMs that will work with a Mac CD ROM player CD Caddies, HD floppy disks, any used Macintosh software, a 387-33Mhz Co-Processor, or basically anything you have lying around (cans of soup, the neighbor's cat, etc...)  Make me an offer, no offer will be overlooked... I really want to get rid of this stuff...Ok, Here's the list:52 Meg 3.5" SCSI Hard Drive.  Conner Model #CP-3150.  I bought this from a guyat a swap meet to use with my Macintosh.  Unfortunately, I can't seem to get it to work with the SCSI controller in my computer.  Theguy tested it with his PC, and printed out a copy of the Norton Disk Doctor report which says it has no bad sectors. (I'll send you a copy) I was dumb enough not to get his phone number, so I can't return it to him. The drive has many jumpers on it, (which I don't know how to set) so maybe that's the problem.  I was quite disappointed that it didn'twork so I'm trying to minimize my losses.~$4552 Meg 3.5" SCSI Hard Drive. Conner Model #CP-3150.  Same situation as above.I bought both of these drives from the same guy.  Despite the differentmodel numbers they are the same exact drive.  Same report from NDD(I have one for each drive) will be included.~$4540 Meg SONY 3.5" SCSI Hard Drive.  SONY Model #SRD2040A.  The drive mechanism is completely trashed.  This hard drive was in my computer (Mac SE) andhad a stiction problem.  Well, repeated banging on the side of thecomputer resulted in a head crash (yes, metal scraping metal) whichwas not too pleasant to listen to.  Still the SCSI controllercard is in good working order, and can be used for parts, or a project.~$2065 Meg Seagate 5.25" HH SCSI Hard Drive.  Model #ST-277N.  I originally boughtthis drive, because it had a small stiction problem, and I though thatI could fix it.  Well I determined that the drive mechanism was fine,and that it was a controller problem.  (motor controller wasn't sendingproper signals.)  Well, after taking the controller off the drive, looking at it, and putting it back together, I realized that Iaccidentally severed one of the small flat cables that connect the drive to the controller.  I tried to solder it, but I'm not that goodat soldering so I couldn't do it.  Worked perfectly before I messedup.  I used it as a temporary drive when the SONY (above) crashed onme.  Also loaded the drive with about twenty Mac applications,worth well over $1000.  (Claris CAD, MS Word 5.0, Think C,Excel, and many others) I think all it needs is a resoldering of that cable.  You also get allthe software on the drive. (if you can accept being a pirate)  I only ask that you delete my data files from the drive.  I was really angrywhen I broke that connection, and then couldn't fix it.  I just don't have time to play with it any more.~$65AT&T ISDN 7500 Modem.  This is for use on digital phone systems.  If you knowwhat this is or would like technical information on it, let me know.  Ihave some tech documents on it.  Is supposed to be the same thing as anAT&T digital phone, but without the phone part.  It seems to be in  working order (passes self test perfectly OK).  I have no idea how this is worth...   Let me know if you're interested.Motorola 68881 CoProcessor.  I haven't tested this one out yet, but if anyone is interested I will get it tested out, to make sure that it works.  Ihad trouble using it with my accelerator board, but then I spoke to themanufacturer of the board and found out it couldn't be used without another controller chip.  When I was looking around to buy one new, theprices were around $100.  I will guarantee this to work.~$65CGA Card.  Half-Length. 8-bit.  Wasn't working last time I checked (althoughI think I was using a bad monitor)~$55.25"360K Floppy Drive.  IBM Drive Type 1355.  Guaranteed to work, because when I took it out of the PC, it was working!~$255.25" 360K Floppy Drive.  Toshiba Model Number ND-08DE-A.  Guaranteed to work.  Came out of same PC as above.~$255.25"Floppy Drives.  Can't guarantee that these will work.  I don'teven know if they are low or high density drives.  I don't haveany method of testing them.Panasonic Model number: JU-455-5 ACG.  There's anothernumber on it: 2626-361723.Panasonic Model number: JU-475-2 AGG.  There's alsoanother number on it: H3649-101457Toshiba Model Number ND-08DE.  Virtually identical to the one above.Each Drive ~$103.5" PS/2 Drive.  These things are proprietary, so I can't test it, but Ithink it works.  Not sure if it's high density or low density, but Isuppose someone who is looking for one would know.  Model NumberDFL413C04A.  I think these things are expensive to replace.  ~$35MFM Hard Drive Controller Cards.  I've got three of these, and I have no wayof testing them.  Two of them are 8-bit cards, and one is a sixteen bitcard with a floppy controller built in.~$10 for the 8-bits ~$15 forthe 16-bit card w/floppy.Interesting cable.  Seems to convert from a VGA plug to an EGA plug.  That is,standard nine-pin to VGA 15 pin. Made by Hewlett Packard.  Part No.D1181-80020~$10I've sold stuff like this before, and it was a huge success, with many satisfied people trading or bartering stuff they didn't need anymore.  I usually ship through the U.S. Postal Service (haven't had any problems yet) and the shipping costs will be split or negotiated.Well, that's all folks.  As I said before, no offer will be refused.  If you can convince me to give OCit to you instead of throwing it out, TRY!  I hateto throw away stuff...-Waynewdempsey@athena.mit.edu(617)-225-9349

Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), andwhat I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controllercard on my ISA 486-50.I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range.And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head)about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm gettingsomething like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would thisnumber compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, andthe state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what wouldYOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if Iwere to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD?And how much would it cost?I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hookup a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec.Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (andown the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port aSCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSIHD's SCSI-2?Thanks for any comments on these rephrased questions.Randy

I bought a new 486 machine not long ago after being disconnected from thepc world for a while (I have been running on an xt 5MHz till last january!!).The machine I bought came equipped with a ATI VGA XL 24 graphic card. Itgives a very nice picture and the  Windows drivers are pretty stable. The onlyproblem is that it is quite slow.I would like to go for a faster card (not in the 400$ range). I saw a lotof comments on many products over the last weeks, but didn't get an overallpicture clear enough to make a choice. My question is : Could somebodydirect me to a source of information which would help me in my quest.I would like to get information about :     - the refresh rates the various cards provide;     - quality of windows drivers;     - standard vga performance (non-Windows stuff).Direct me to a magazine article or something like that (I got winvid.zip info, but it is not enough). If you have an ISA card you are really satisfiedwith it,  let me know.If this information is of any use, here is my system configuration:- Fujikama 486 33MHz ISA system (Contaq motherboard)- monitor DARIUS 14" non-interlaced multisync (up to 1024X768)                                (can reach 70kHz horizontally)  I would also like to know if it is a standard for video drivers to allowscreen dimensioning and screen positioning by writing on the EPROM of thegraphic card. This is the case with my ATI card and it is very convenientwhen changing graphics mode since my monitor is not intelligent enough to record settings.Merci a l'avance for any information you would be kind enough to provide me,Guy Lamouchelamouche@ere.umontreal.ca

Ideas and info gladly accepted.)I do not have specific knowledge of Lap-Link or Telix, but my recommendationfor ANY package is to follow each one's instructions for making the null-modem cable.  The reason is that each one may be different since there isn'treally a standard for PC to PC communications.  The following is a tutorialI wrote up that will give you an understanding about RS-232 and null modems,but you should still check your software!I will eplain a couple of details of RS-232.  RS-232 isa commumications specification for communicating between a computer and amodem.  Actually it can be between any end system and any communicationshardware.  The terminology used is Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and DATACommunications Equipment (DCE).  RS-232 spells out the voltage levels, theconnector type, the pinouts, and the signal protocols.  The connector isa "DB-25" but IBM has set an alternative "standard" of DB-9.  The primarysignals are Transmit Data (TD), Recieve Data (RD), and Signal Ground (SG).There are other signals that provide control between the DTE and the DCE.For example, the DTE announces that it is powered up and ready to participatein communications via the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signal.  DTR is anoutput on the DTE and an input on the DCE.  Similarly, the DCE announces thatit is ready to participate in communications via the Data Set Ready (DSR)signal.  DSR is an input on the DTE and an output on the DCE.  Ok that'sfive signals; there are only four more of interest.  The Request To Send (RTS)signal is an output from the DTE (and an input to the DCE) that is usedto ask the DCE permission to send data.  If the DCE agrees, it sends an okvia the Clear To Send (CTS) signal.  (For completeness, the CTS is an inputto the DTE and an output from the DCE).  The other two signals (of interest)are Ring Indicator (RI) and Data Carrier Detect (DCD).  These are both inputsto the DTE and outputs from the DCE.  RI is just what you would expect -a signal to the DTE saying that someone is attempting to establish a connectionto the DCE.  This is rather specific to the modem / telephone line setup.DCD is a way for the DCE to announce that the "connection" has been establishedi.e. the local DCE is talking to some remote DCE.  There - that's it.  Ohthere are many other RS-232 signals defined, but they are obsolete.  I haveexplained the nine signals that are on a PC.  The pinouts are as follows:Name    DB-9     DB-25 SG       5        7 TD       3        2 RD       2        3DTR       4       20DSR       6        6DCD       1        8RTS       7        4CTS       8        5 RI       9       22Now to address your problem at hand.  When you connect a PC to a PC (a DTEto a DTE), there is no DCE pair in the middle and therefore the RS-232signal definitions don't work out quite right.  There is no DCE to assertthe CTS, DSR, DCD, or RI.  So the common thing to do is to not use thesesignals at all - and also forget about the DTR and RTS outputs as well.  Ifthis is done you simply make a null modem (a cable) that passes through SG,and crosses TD and RD (i.e. pin 2 of one end connects to pin 3 at the otherend, etc).  The problem with this solution is that a PC that wants to senddata has no way of knowing if the other PC is ready.  It would have to justsend the data and hope it got through.  Therefore a better null modem wouldinclude the DTR/DSR pair crossed.  A particular point a confusion is in thesoftware area.  Just because you run the wires does not mean that the soft-ware will use them.  If you are using the built-in BIOS to control theserial port, then the BIOS dictates what wires you need and how they are tobe used.  But if you have a comm. package such as Brooklyn Bridge, or Lap-Link or Telix, then those packages dictate the cabling requirements.  Theonly thing you can guess reliably is the SG, TD, and RD.  The DTR/DSR is alsofairly common.  There is one more issue that needs to be addressed here.  Andthat is flow control.  In the RS-232 scenerio, the DCE's are responsible forflow control and it is assumed that the DCE couldn't possible over-run theDTE.  By this I mean that as long as the DTE has its DTR line asserted, theDCE will send data - without requesting permission first.  Note the contrastto the other direction of data flow: the DTE must request permission byasserting the RTS line and it must wait for the CTS signal before it cansend.  And now in the DTE to DTE scenerio, the question is do you need flowcontrol?  The answser is usually.  But how?  For non-binary communications,one common technique is XON - XOFF which is implemented in software - nowires are dedicated to flow control; the TD and RD carry the XON and XOFFcommands.  This type of flow control can be used in addition to hardwareflow control, but the problem is that you can't send binary data becauseyour data might include the XON or XOFF codes and cause erroneous conrolsignals.  (A work around is to have the software insert and extract "escape"codes, but the hardware flow control is prefered).  The problem with hard-ware flow control is that there is no standard.  There are lots of ways todo it and I bet they have all been tried.  One cornerstone of all the methodsis to use the RTS/CTS for one direction.  But beyond that anything is fairgame.  Again, you must look to you comm package for cabling requirements.But I bet you'll find that one cable (if wired properly) could work withall of the packages as long as they are of the same vintage.  By the way,I am familiar with one package that uses RTS/CTS and DTR/DSR for flow controlthe RTS is request to send and the DTR is ready to recieve, the CTS is theclear to send and the DSR is the request to recieve.  This does not mean adiffernt cable - it is just software.  The clincher to all of this cablingstuff is that it is common to have the UART directly controlled by the CTSsignal which means that the CTS must be present even if you are not support-ing it in software.  For these cases you will find cables that short theRTS to the CTS at the same end (or perhaps the DTR to the CTS).  Otherpossible shorting might be done just because the software expects certainsignals that you don't have (or don't feel like providing because it wouldmean additional wires).  Specifically I am talking about the DSR.  Shortingthe DTR to the DSR is not a good idea in general but you may find cables likethis.  It is a bad idea because it defeats the whole purpose.  One more"gotcha" signal is the DCD.  Some software (including the PC BIOS) expects tosee the DCD before it will work.  This signal sometimes gets shorted with theDTR.  But my favorite null modem has the RTS and CTS shorted at each end, butthe RTS is also connected through to the other end and connected to DCD.  Andof course the DTR/DSR are crossed as are the TD/RD and of course the SG mustpass through.  This null modem works with most software.  The flow control,if any, can use the RTS/DCD with the DTR/DSR.  If your comm. package does notspecify the cable required for PC to PC connection, then I suggest you usethis one.

My problem is this.  My system only had a IDE cable: for one drive, so I had to buy cable with two drive connectors: on it, and consequently have to switch cables.  The problem is, : the new hard drive's manual refers to matching pin 1 on the cable: with both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the IDE card.  But: for the life of me I cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug: in the cable to align these.  Most IDE drives that I have dealt with have had pin 2 labeled on the printedcircuit board (this is sufficient to determine which side is which).  If yourIDE drive does not have a label, then you can look for a polarization notch inthe receptacle (the connector on the drive with the pins).  If the receptacleis center polarized, that is it has one rectangular notch about 4 mm widepositioned in the center of one side, then you can identify pin 1 as follows:look into the pins with the notch at the top, pin 1 is at the top right.  Onall drives I have seen this is toward the power connector.  As for which pinis pin 1 on the controller, well you can use the same criteria but look hardfor the labelling of any pin.  Once you know which end pin 1&2 are on or pins39 & 40 (the oposite end), then you are all set.  All you need to do is keepthe pin 1 end connected to the pin 1 end.  You don't even have to look at thecable itself.  Just trace the pin 1 side of the cable through.  Usually thepin 1 of the cable is identified by a different color (red usually).  Butbeware - many cable makers are not very careful about this - I have seen cableswith pin 40 being the one marked red.  Of course with non-polarized connectorsthis doesn't matter - you can plug the cable in either way and YOU decidewhich side is pin 1.: Secondly, the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them.: I figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into: the drives.  Does it matter which I plug into the "master" drive: and which into the "Slave"?  any help appreciated.  thanks...It doesn't matter what gets plugged where.  But it does matter how the drivesare jumpered.  There will be (amongst other options) two jumpers that youshould be concerned with on BOTH drives.  One jumper will select whether thedrive is the slave or the master.  If it is the master, then a second jumperselects whether or not a slave is present.  You will have to consult the docuementation that came with you drives.  If you do not have docuementation,then just call the manufacturers hotline number or fax number if they haveone.  This kind of information is routinely needed by people just likeyourself.  They will fax you complete info about the jumpers.  If you don'thave convenient access to a fax machine, then you can usually get voicehelp.  Or post the specific question to this group.  (I probably won't beable to help you).Good LuckGordon Lang

See the sectioncalled, "Windows 3.1 runs slowly", for some ways of speeding your systemup.* Windows configuration:     To get the Adaptec 1542 to work with Windows, make sure that the"[388Enh]" section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains the entry:VirtualHDIRQ=OffI believe that the Windows install program automatically adds this entryto SYSTEM.INI, but I'm not sure.  If this doesn't work for you, youmight want to try adding some more lines:VirtualHDIRQ=OffSystemROMBreakPoint=falseEMMExclude=A000-CFFF(You probably don't need the above lines, though.)  The"SystemROMBreakPoint" entry is used to enable support for memorymanagers like QEMM/386MAX (only needed if you use such programs).* Windows 3.1 runs slowly:     Once you do get Windows 3.1 running with the 1542, chances are thatyour system is running much slower than before.  If it's not, it'sprobably because:     1. You happen to be using ASPI4DOS.SYS version 3.1 in yourCONFIG.SYS file.  Congratulations -- this appears to be awinning solution.     2. You are very lucky.  Whether your luck will hold out remains tobe seen ....If your system is running much slower than before, this is almostdefinitely caused by Smartdrive with double-buffering.  According to theWindows documentation, and the Microsoft technical note #Q81808("SMARTDrive Double Buffering Required with ASPI4DOS.SYS"), you must useSmartdrive with double-buffering enabled.  While this works, it reallyslows down your PC; I once estimated that this slowed my PC down by afactor of 5 (FIVE).  As I consider this unacceptable, I looked for othersolutions.     Unfortunately, you cannot just disable double-buffering.  If youdo, Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode will not work, and you might evendestroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run Windows 3.1.What you can do is one of the following:     1. Use other drivers that provide double-buffering.  It is myopinion that the unbelievable slowness in Smartdrive is causedeither by horribly inefficient double-buffering, or by a bug inSmartdrive.     2. Use a driver that provides "VDS" services ("VDS" stands for"Virtual DMA Services").  This is a standard, which is supportedby Windows 3.1, that allows bus-mastering disk controllers (likethe 1542) to work with Windows.     After trashing my hard disk countless times, I found the followingsolutions, none of which require using Smartdrive (note, however, that Iam now getting occasional parity errors, which are probably *NOT* causedby these solutions, but might be -- see below).  While the followingdoes not require Smartdrive, using some kind of disk cache utility isstrongly recommended, as this makes Windows run much, much faster:1. If you do not have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, or you do not need ASPI   functions (for controlling a CDROM, tape drive, more than two   physical hard disks, etc.), you can add the SCSIHA.SYS driver to your   CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:DRIVER=c:\\SCSIHA.SYS /V386   (Windows needs the "/V386" option.)  This driver MUST be loaded into   LOW memory (it cannot be loaded into high memory), and it occupies   about 16-20K.  As of November 1992, the SCSIHA.SYS driver could be   obtained from the Adaptec BBS at (408)-945-7727 (hopefully, it's   still there).2. If you need ASPI functions and have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, version   3.0 or 3.0a, you can use both the ASPI4DOS.SYS and SCSIHA.SYS drivers   in your CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:DRIVER=c:\\ASPI4DOS.SYSDRIVER=c:\\SCSIHA.SYS /V386   Amazingly enough, the SCSIHA.SYS driver can also be loaded high   (assuming you have DOS 5.0); I would have thought that this would   crash my system, but it doesn't.  I asked Adaptec's technical support   about this, and they said that loading SCSIHA.SYS high should be fine   as long as ASPI4DOS.SYS is loaded LOW.   On my system, NOT using SCSIHA.SYS with ASPI4DOS 3.0a would   occasionally cause Windows 3.1 to crash upon restarting or exiting   Windows, with the additional result of a corrupted disk (some of my   C:\\WINDOWS\\*.GRP files would be corrupted).  For me, these crashes   usually occurred while making a different program from PROGMAN.EXE   the default Windows shell, and vice-versa.  This is the reason   SCSIHA.SYS may be necessary.   I have absolutely no idea if SCSIHA.SYS is necessary with versions of   ASPI4DOS earlier than 3.0.   Note that many people can use ASPI4DOS 3.0 or 3.0a without   SCSIHA.SYS; they do not seem to have any problems at all.  I consider   these people lucky.  Others, like me, have had all sorts of problems.3. In my opinion, the best, but not necessarily the easiest, solution is   to upgrade to ASPI4DOS 3.1.  The SCSIHA.SYS driver is no longer   needed.  Unfortunately, while you could get previous ASPI4DOS   upgrades from the Adaptec BBS, the ASPI4DOS 3.1 driver is not   available from the Adaptec BBS.  As far as I know, there are only   three ways to get a copy:      * You can buy the new (as of November 1992) Adaptec EZ SCSI driverkit, which supposedly includes ASPI4DOS 3.1 as well as otherdrivers, such as CDROM drivers.  I believe the list price isaround $75.      * If you already have a copy of an older version of ASPI4DOS, youcan supposedly contact Adaptec to upgrade it to EZ SCSI foraround $30.      * A copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1 is included in Central Point PC Tools 8.0for MSDOS.  Note that the documentation and driver are stored indifferent directories.  Note further that only ASPI4DOS isincluded; the CDROM drivers and drivers to support more than twohard disks are not included.  This is where I obtained my copyof ASPI4DOS 3.1.Note, however, that I am now getting occasional parity errors withWindows.  In all probability, defective hardware in my PC is causingthis, as I upgraded my motherboard just after I found the abovesolutions.  However, because these parity errors occur only during diskaccesses, there is a very small, but definite, possibility that theparity errors are driver-related (for example, changing the bus on/offtiming for certain disk transfers might cause this).  I've run variousmemory tests for hours at a time, and these tests have found noproblems.  This problem is probably caused by memory with marginaltiming requirements, which cause parity errors during disk transfers(this is why the memory tests didn't find any problems -- the problemsshow up only under disk I/O).  However, I'm mentioning this just in caseit isn't a hardware problem.***** Floppy-controller-based tape backup devices:     There are two possible problems with using the Adaptec 1542 with afloppy-controller-based tape backup device, such as the Colorado MemorySystems Jumbo 250:1. Tape backups/restores can take a very long time.  The tape drive   constantly starts, stops, starts, stops, etc.2. Tape operations may be erratic, or encounter too many tape errors.   (This problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542.   However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so   I'm mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my   1542.)* Tape backups/restores take a long time:     If you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device, you mayhave to adjust the Adaptec 1540/1542 "bus on/off timing" for bestresults when using the tape drive.  Normally, while doing a tape backupor restore, the tape drive motor should be continuously running, withonly an occasional pause.  However, the default bus timing on theAdaptec 1540/1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop,start and stop, every few seconds.  This causes needless wear to thetape and tape drive (however, note that a dirty tape head or a defectivetape drive can also cause this -- make sure your tape heads are clean).This also causes the tape backup or restore to take much, much longerthan necessary.     The problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy DMA totransfer data in memory to/from the tape drive, and the Adaptec uses DMAto transfer data in memory to/from the hard disk.  The floppy DMA needsto feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate; if the tape drive isnot fed data quickly enough by the floppy DMA, the tape drive stops,rewinds a bit, and restarts (once enough data is eventually fed to it).The default bus timing on the Adaptec (which is really DMA timing) is"too large".  For example, when a backup is done, data has to betransferred from a hard disk to memory, and then from memory to thetape.  Because the default timing on the Adaptec "hogs" the memory toomuch (too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk tomemory), not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to thetape drive.  As a result, the tape drive constantly starts and stops,because data is not fed to it quickly enough.     The solution is to change the Adaptec's bus on/off timing.  Thedefault factory setting is 11 microseconds on, and 5 microseconds off.The "bus on" timing needs to be lowered to 2-4 microseconds.  This canbe done in one of two ways:* If you have ASPI4DOS, you can use the "/n" option.  For example, I use  a "bus on" timing of 4 microseconds, which means that I use the  following line in my CONFIG.SYS file:DEVICE=c:\\aspi4dos.sys /n4  Note that there is NO space between the "/n" and the "4".* If you don't have ASPI4DOS, your only recourse is to try to find a  program called "SETSCSI.EXE", which is very difficult to find.  The  reason is that Adaptec, for reasons of their own, does not seem to  want this widely distributed.  I once asked someone who worked for  Adaptec, and they asked me to not upload it anywhere.  If you have  anonymous ftp access to the Internet, you could try using archie to  hunt down a copy; I believe that there are a couple of sites that have  it.  If you do find a copy, you run it like so:setscsi -n:4  This adjusts the "bus on" timing to 4 microseconds.  Running  SETSCSI.EXE without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the  factory defaults.  Note that it seems that you cannot use SETSCSI.EXE if you use  ASPI4DOS; SETSCSI.EXE crashed my system if ASPI4DOS was loaded.  I  could use SETSCSI.EXE with SCSIHA.SYS, however.Do not lower the "bus on" timing below 2 microseconds, or increase itabove 11 microseconds.  If you lower it too low, the hard diskthroughput will suddenly drop; your system will feel slower.  For me, 4microseconds works fine.  This value may work fine for you, or you mayhave to adjust it downwards a little.     Once you've lowered the "bus on" timing, tape backups and restoresshould run faster.     Also, do not experiment with the bus on/off times (with the otheroptions that I have intentionally not described), unless you know whatyou are doing.  Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse, bystarving memory refresh.     A program called BUSTIFIX.EXE exists on the Adaptec BBS.  Unlessthis has been upgraded since I last checked (which has been a while),this is a self-extracting archive containing a batch file and a coupleof other files.  This batch file was supposed to allow one to set thebus on/off times for the 1540/1542 and others.  However, when I triedrunning this program with my 1542A, my system crashed.  At the time, Iwas running SCSIHA.SYS, and I didn't check to see if there was aconflict with it.  Maybe this old program works only with the 1542B,although the docs say that it works with the 1542A?* Erratic tape operations or too many tape errors:     This "problem" may or may not exist.  Although it existed on mysystem, a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it.However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so I'mmentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem just on my1542.     Symptoms of this "problem", which persists even after cleaning thetape head:1. Backing up to tape encounters "unusable sector detected" errors,   resulting in an aborted tape backup.2. Tape backup works, but the tape compare fails.3. The tape drive starts, stops, starts, stops, etc. much too often.   Unlike the above-mentioned problem ("Tape backups/restores take a   long time"), where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds,   this kind of starting/stopping occurs every few 10-20 seconds or so.4. Fastback Plus 3.1 does not find/see any tape backup devices.  Other   programs, like Central Point Backup and the CMS Jumbo software   (assuming that you have a CMS Jumbo 250 tape drive) can find/see the   tape drive, but Fastback Plus 3.1 cannot.5. Too many tape read errors.     Although I do not know what is causing this problem, I discoveredthat using a different floppy controller solves it.  A few months ago, Iupgraded my motherboard, which contained an integrated floppycontroller.  As I already had a floppy controller on the 1542, Iinitially disabled the motherboard floppy controller.  After a while, Idecided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one onthe motherboard.  When I did this, the tape drive (a CMS Jumbo 250)reliability increased dramatically, and Fastback Plus 3.1 was suddenlyable to find and use the tape drive.     I don't know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542.On the one hand, the floppy drives worked great when they were attachedto the 1542, which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the1542.  On the other hand, the tape drive didn't work well attached tothe 1542 floppy controller, but it did work when attached to a differentcontroller; this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my1542.  I did change floppy drive cables, and so it is conceivable thatthe problem was in the cables.  I don't know what the cause really is;however, if you're having similar problems, you might want to considertrying a new floppy controller.***** Sound cards:     Many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound, andthis is typically done using DMA.  Like the tape drive DMA, theAdaptec's DMA can conflict with the sound card DMA.  Unlike that of thetape DMA, this "conflict" usually manifests itself as a parity error(your system crashes with a parity error message).  What happens isthat, data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and theAdaptec, memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough, which causes aparity error.  Usually, getting a parity error means that there is ahardware problem with your system; in this case, however, the parityerror is not a symptom of bad hardware.     I've found that such parity errors typically occur while recordingdigitized sound, and the chances of such errors increase as you increasethe recording fidelity (e.g., higher sampling rate, recording in stereo,recording using 16-bits instead of 8, etc.).     Like the tape drive solution, the solution here is to lower theAdaptec's "bus on" timing.  See the section on tape drives forinformation on how this is done.  Note, however, that this may or maynot solve the problem; it may only reduce the probability of a parityerror.  The software used to record digitized sound can greatly affectthis problem (i.e., some software is inefficient).  Disk caches, thespeed of your hard disk, and the amount of disk fragmentation can alsoaffect this.***** Miscellaneous info:     This section contains miscellaneous hints, tips, and rumors.  Muchof it is merely information that I've heard or read about, and have notverified.  I believe that the following information is correct, but I'mnot sure.  Use it at your own risk.* With QEMM 6.00, 6.01, and 6.02, you need to specify the "DB="  parameter (e.g., "DB=2"), unless you are using the ASPI4DOS driver.  If you don't, QEMM will crash/hang at bootup.  Although the QEMM  manual mentions this, the install program does not seem to detect that  a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM  command line (at least, this occurred with the QEMM 6.00 install  program -- I haven't tested any other version).  Earlier versions of  QEMM probably need this parameter, but I'm not sure (I've never used a  version earlier than 6.00).  If you use ASPI4DOS, you do not need to give QEMM the "DB=" parameter.* Some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one  gigabyte in size.  To support hard disks with capacities over 1GB, you  need to get a new ROM BIOS from Adaptec.  I'm not sure if this is  still true of the latest 1542Bs being sold by Adaptec.* To connect a CDROM drive to the 1542, you need a SCSI CDROM drive and  some drivers.  Note that some CDROM drives have proprietary interfaces  (non-SCSI); these drives cannot be used with the 1542.  You have three  choices for CDROM drivers (I have no idea how well the following  solutions work, or even if they work -- the following is secondhand  information):     1. You can buy Adaptec's EZ SCSI driver package, which lists forsomething like $75.  If you already have older Adaptec drivers,you can supposedly upgrade to EZ SCSI for around $30.  ContactAdaptec for details.  The EZ SCSI package supposedly containseverything that you need.     2. You can buy the CorelSCSI! driver package, which is made by thesame people that make CorelDRAW!  This package contains CDROMdrivers, SCSI tape drivers, WORM drivers, etc.  I do not knowthe list price, but I've seen this package sold for around$80-$90.  Note that CorelSCSI! does not come with the ASPI4DOSdriver, which is needed.  If you do not already have ASPI4DOS,you may be better off getting Adaptec's EZ SCSI instead.     3. [This method is obsolete, as the following drivers have beenobsoleted by Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit, but I'm mentioning it incase someone already has these drivers.]  You can use thedrivers in the Adaptec ASW-1410 kit (ASPI4DOS) and the ASW-410kit (ASPI CDROM drivers).  You will have to get a copy ofMSCDEX.EXE (a high-level CDROM driver), if it is not included inthe ASW-410 kit, but this is available from several bulletinboards.* To use a SCSI tape drive with the 1542, you need software that knows  how to talk to a SCSI tape drive.  Software that I've heard about are  (again, like the above section on CDROM drives, I have no idea how  well the following solutions work, or even if they work -- the  following is secondhand information):     1. Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS supposedly supports a largenumber of SCSI tape drives.  It comes with SCSI drivers(ASPI4DOS 3.1) as well as Central Point Backup.     2. The CorelSCSI! driver package contains a SCSI tape backupprogram (see the above section on CDROM drives for moredetails).  However, note that CorelSCSI! does not come with, butrequires, ASPI4DOS.* I've seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations:     1. 1542 SCSI controller with hard disk ROM BIOS.     2. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and Adaptec ASPI drivers.     3. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS, Adaptec ASPI drivers, andCorelSCSI! drivers/programs.  I imagine that Adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration:     4. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and EZ SCSI drivers (including ASPIdrivers).* Those people who use Unix might be interested in a version of GNU tar  for MSDOS that talks to a SCSI tape drive via the ASPI4DOS driver (you  need this driver before you can use this program).  I've never used  this version of GNU tar, but I've heard that it works (I don't know  how well, though).  If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet,  a copy can be found on wsmr-simtel20.army.mil and mirror sites:PD1:<MSDOS.DSKUTL>ASPIBIN.ZIP  67841 920131 Gnu Tar for SCSI tape drives, Adaptec 154xxASPIPAT.ZIP  21206 920131 Patches for ASPIBIN relative to Gnu Tar 1.10ASPISRC.ZIP 221370 920131 Src for Gnu Tar for SCSI tape, Adaptec ctrlr  I have no idea if a copy can be found on Compuserve; UNIXFORUM might  have it, if any forum does.* As far as MSDOS is concerned, the 1542A and the 1542B controllers are  the same; with MSDOS, the 1542A should work as well as the 1542B.  However, the hardware for these two boards is not 100% identical, and  there is at least one (NON-MSDOS) program that initially did not work  with a 1542A, but did work with a 1542B (BSD386 -- a 386 version of  BSD Unix).* In case anyone's curious, here's an edited copy of my CONFIG.SYS file:FILES=40BUFFERS=40BREAK=ONSTACKS=10,256DEVICE=c:\\sys\\dev\\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4DEVICE=C:\\QEMM\\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFFDOS=HIGH,UMBDEVICEHIGH=c:\\sys\\dev\\nnansi.sysDEVICEHIGH=C:\\DOS\\SETVER.EXEshell = c:\\dos\\command.com /p  Note that I'm using QEMM and ASPI4DOS 3.1.  If I were using ASPI4DOS  3.0 or 3.0a, I'd probably have to use a CONFIG.SYS that looked like:FILES=40BUFFERS=40BREAK=ONSTACKS=10,256DEVICE=c:\\sys\\dev\\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4DEVICE=C:\\QEMM\\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFFDOS=HIGH,UMBDEVICEHIGH=c:\\sys\\dev\\scsiha.sys /V386DEVICEHIGH=c:\\sys\\dev\\nnansi.sysDEVICEHIGH=C:\\DOS\\SETVER.EXEshell = c:\\dos\\command.com /p  If I weren't using ASPI4DOS, I'd probably use something that looked  like:FILES=40BUFFERS=40BREAK=ONSTACKS=10,256DEVICE=c:\\sys\\dev\\scsiha.sys /V386DEVICE=C:\\QEMM\\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DB=32 DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFFDOS=HIGH,UMBDEVICEHIGH=c:\\sys\\dev\\nnansi.sysDEVICEHIGH=C:\\DOS\\SETVER.EXEshell = c:\\dos\\command.com /p  However, if I used a floppy-controller-based tape drive, or if I  planned to record high-quality sound from a sound card, I would still  need some way of changing the Adaptec's bus on/off times.  The first  two versions of CONFIG.SYS take care of this, but this last version  doesn't.\fLocal Variables:fill-column:72eval:(auto-fill-mode nil)End:

Nor did they particularly care to investigate.OK, here's my results so far....1: You have to define the monitor as LCD - it doesn't really support   Analogue video input (It works, but isn't very linear...)2: The incoming sync pulses need inverting. This is best achieved   with either a cmos XOR package or a transistor inverter.   If you don't know how to do it, don't even contemplate it.. :-)3: It'll only work in standard VGA mode.OK, having said that, I'm trying to either find a circuit or ICwhich will act as a universal sync decoder.I want somethikng which basically only detects the leading syncpulse edge, and doesn't care about the polarity, outputtingthe -ve going pulses that the atari monitor requires.There are 2 reasons for doing this1: VGA cards change their sync polarity depending which mode they're   in - herc emulation is +,- while MVGA is +,+ for example.2: It means I don't have to put a toggle switch on the back of the   monitor in order to be able to run it off both the atari and my   IBM. Currently I have 3 (Yes, 3!) monitors sitting on my desk,   and I want to get that number down as much as possible.   Being able to use the atari monitor as a paper-white VGA   will cut things down to 2. If I forget about Atari colour,   I can get down to 1.Ultimately, the best course of action is to get a multisync monitor,but I'm as pressed for cash as anyone else, so it'll have to wait...--Alan Browndogbowl@dogbox.acme.gen.nz

As for the less compression,>>kobergI recall reading a review article in PC Computing wherein they reporteda reduction in the loading time for lengthy programs using Stacker 3.0.This was not due to the compression algorithm per se, but to the factthat fewer fetches were required during the sequential file access. Doesanyone have any actual performance numbers relating to speeds of Stackerand Dblspace?bs
