It has an access of 200ms and a datatransfer rate 300Kb/sec.  It is multisession photo-cd compatible.  It isavailable from educorp for $599, the CD-Technology one, and comes with twomail in coupons for two free CDs.  I'm not sure if the cd's are good, sinceI've only had the drive a little less than a month and had the cd's shippedto my home address in california instead of here in maryland.  TheCD-technology drive has a separate power supply separated from the drive,which supposedly gives it a longer life, and keeps it cleaner with no fan toattract dust.  A Toshiba brand drive is also available, but I think theCD-Technology is better, since you get the same mechanism, and at a slightlylower price with two free CDs.The Apple 300/330i Drive, Sony Mechanism, is around a 300ms access time Ithink, and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  I know it is the slowest of thethree mentioned here.  It is not widely available, except through the applecatalog, which is bad at a price of only $599.  It is also multi-session photocd compatible. I think the external model comes with 7 free cds, some ofwhich are pretty good.The NEC drive has been out the longest.  it has an access time of 280ms anda data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  it is available from many vendors around$600 dollars, including Educorp.  It wasn't multi-sesssion photo-cd compatiblebefore, but I hear that the current version that is shipping is.  Owners ofthe older drives can get an upgrade.  It does not come with any free cd'sunless you buy it in a bundle.Of the three CD-Rom drives above, i think the best choices would be theApple drive and the CD-technology(toshiba) drive.  The apple drive for it'scompatibility with apple products and the cd-technology(toshiba) for it'sspeed and performance. BTW, the models of the drives are:Apple: AppleCD 300 or AppleCD 300i (internal)CD-Technology:  CD-T3401 (the Toshiba brand name model I'm not sure, but itis also something like with 3401)NEC:  CDR-74I'm very happy with my drive.  And have had no compatibility problemswhatsoever.  If I am wrong about any of the above, do correct me, but I ampretty sure of myself, even when I think I'm not.Also, some of you out there might notice that I have the same last name asthe president of CD-Technology which happens to be in southern california,my hometown.  However, I AM NOT a relative nor do I know the guy.  Liu isjust a common chinese name, especially in southern california, with theenormous chinese community.

It took just over two weeks from placing the order.  The dealer (Rutgers computer store) appologized because Apple made a substitution on my order.  I orderedthe one without ethernet, but they substituted one _with_ ethernet.He wanted to know if that would be "alright with me"!!!  They mustbe backlogged on Centri w/out ethernet so they're just shipping themwith!  Anyway, I'm very happy with the 610 with a few exceptions.  Being nosy, I decided to open it up _before_ powering it on for the firsttime.  The SCSI cable to the hard drive was only partially connected(must have come loose in shipping).  No big deal, but I would have beenpissed if I tried to boot it and it wouldn't come up!The hard drive also has an annoying high pitched whine.  I'veheard apple will exchange it if you complain, so I might try to getit swapped.I am also dissappionted by the lack of soft power-on/off.  Thiswasn't mentioned in any of the literature I saw.  Also, the locationof the reset/interupt buttons is awful.  Having keyboard control forthese functions was much more convenient.Oh, and the screen seems tojump in a wierd way on power-up.I've seen this mentioned by others, so it must be a...feature...Anyway, above all, it's fast.

Some>send data to both, some only send data to the left channel>(the first is preferrable, of course)Okay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound.The original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how tomake sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam valuesinto all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This wasbecauseof how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was byscanningthis block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy onsome machines).When the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed togenerate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we hadoncedocumented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant "Iwant toplay a mono sound" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retractedthedocumentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layersofsound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if youwantto make stereo sound.Enter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager areinconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port fromtheIBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for gamewriters to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.Since the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound outputhardware,and the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBaseworks.On some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBasegets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra700/900/950at least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channelonly.Both are technically correct interpretations of the originalspecification,but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.If developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), monosounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of theunderlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate leftchannel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, theirgames will only come out the left on some games.The other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel soundon the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related.It is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards ofthe different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds whichare actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter whatmachineyou have.Now, to more directly address the question, the games you list:>Lemmings>Out of This World  (awesome game, BTW)>Glider 4.0>OIDSand alsoHellcats,Super TetrisOxyd(and many more, these are just what I've tested)Cheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.Other games you list:>Armor Alley>Spectre>Spaceward Ho!and alsoPGA Tour GolfCivilization(and more, these are again only from personal experience)Use the sound manager and work fine on all machines.The more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT!Really, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about todo,but I'm going say it anyway.Stop cheating on sound!Really soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakerswill be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace periodis about to end.The Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and willworkeven better soon, so use it.In conclusion:To Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug.To Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to sendsoundto both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care ofautomatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on allhardware.Have fun.Disclaimer number 1:I don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed.So don't write me with sound questions.Disclaimer number 2:If it says up above that I wrote anything like "the grace period is aboutto end" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically notallowed to say anything like that. You know what I mean.Disclaimer number 3:I don't speak for Apple, just me.-Steve Bollinger

I can'tremember trying to rebuild the desktop with it, however it did give mea strange problem.  When I held down shift during startup to disableall extensions, nothing happened. I tried it with another keyboard, usingthe same adb connector cable- and it worked with the other keyboard.The shift key on the Datadesk keyboard worked well otherwise. I checkedthe dipswitches and they are fine.  Try disabling your extensions and tellme if it works.I am annoyed with Datadesk.  I sent them the keyboard in the mail forinspection/repair/replacement.  The technician on the phone said theyhave a 10-14 day turn around time- meaning you should receive theinspected/repaired keyboard in that time.  Well, they have had thekeyboard for over 3 weeks and I still have gotten very little infofrom them about it. It's annoying because it cost me $12 to send themthe keyboard (they do not refund the money) and their costumer servicelines are toll calls. Tell me if you have a similar experience.-Davidmirsky@gnu.ai.mit.edu

What speed SIMMS does the C650 need/want?  (I know that it needs 80nsVRAM...not sure for the main RAM.)2.  I've heard two conflicting stories about the total expandibility of theC650's RAM...132 and 136 megs.  Which is true?  (Perhaps another phrasingwould be better:  does the 8 meg version come with all 8 megs on the logicboard, or 4 megs + a 4 meg SIMM?)Just wondering....-- ***  Dave Hollinsworth  *********  hlsw_ltd@uhura.cc.rochester.edu   O      |"|* "It's astounding;  time is fleeting;  madness takes   * PLAY      /\\      | |* its toll." -- Riff Raff, Rocky Horror Picture Show    * PINBALL! /\\ \\-------|***  DISCLAIMER:  They're my opinions.

After comparing the above strings with my AT commands reference guide, Icame up with:ATZ0L2N2X5&D0S11=50^MThis is entered in the 'Initialize' box on the 'Modem Preferences' in Zterm.Quick summary of each commmand:Z0- Reset modem to User Profile 0.L2- Speaker volume at 2 (fairly quiet)N2- Ring volume at 2 (fairly quiet)X5- Display connect info according to setting 5 (see manual)&D0- Assume DTR (computer) is always onS11=50- Dial speed at 50 (as fast as ZyXEL can handle)In FirstClass, I used this same string, with the addition of S0=0 rightbefore the S11 command, in the setup box.  This disables the auto-answer function of the modem for FirstClass.  I based my modem setting on the Supra14.4FAX, and just changed the above mentioned string.In Telefinder, I based my setting on the Zoom V42 - HH setting.  I changedthe 'Modem Initialization' string to the same one I used for FirstClass, andeverything seems to work fine.Sorry it took so long to get this summary out.  If someone wants to forwardthis to the /info-mac/reports directory at sumex-aim, it might save othernewbie ZyXEL users like myself the trouble of setting up their strings, andalso save the net some redundant messages.

Once the demand fall off a bit, then is thetime to start getting aggressive with pricing.  Waiting too long canreally hurt your business though :-)The PowerBooks have sold very well up to now, if they are slowingdown Apple needs to come out with some lower priced versions (theonly reason I own a PowerBook is that I could spring for a $900 PB100,the rest of the lineup is way to pricey for me).

I have had sporadic SCSIproblems with my IIfx since I bought it. (I cannot connect more than threedevices, fourth one causes major problems).First thing to do is to try to reformat your drive on someone elses system.If you continue to get errors it is probably the drive. If it formats finethen I would try to format it on your system with no externals. If this fails then the SCSI controller on your IIfx needs repair/replacement.Hope this helps. -- David C.

Perhaps the reason is simple--maybe the marketing people who put togetherthe brochures and price lists weren't clear on the FPU issue. Afterall, Apple's literature is not always 100% correct. A funny one Inoticed recently is that some of the brochures on the Macs with CDcapability refer to the "auto inkjet" feature. This should have read "autoinject" feature (as it does on some other correct brochures I've seen fromApple). Since it was correct on some older brochures, I can only guessthat someone edited the copy, saw "inject" and thought it was a typo andchanged it to the more familiar word "inkjet".Hmmm, what would that be? A printer built into the CD player? A way of*writing* information to a CD? :-) :-)

[for MDs]>>By giving the 2.5"MO a floppy interface it could reduce the price of it and>make it easily installed in existing devices.This question is, to me, like asking "Why use SCSI at all?"- Due to the rather primitive standard DMA solution (which is used by almost all  floppy interfaces) of PCs, the speed is limited to approx 500 Kbytes/s.   I want a standard allowing higher performance.- With SCSI, the OS can issue a request to the disk and then go ahead with other  things. Later, when the controller has performed the search and physical read,  data can be transferred to main memory at "RAM speeds". Not very relevant with  MS-DOS, but MS-DOS is not made for the future.- I've *got* a SCSI interface. I've got a 5.25" and a 3.5" floppy, too, and I am  not going to throw them out. With SCSI I may add, for all practical purposes,  an "unlimited" number of disk units without sacrificing any of my old disks. - For my PC, I've got a 300 Mbyte SCSI disk adopted from a SUN machine, and I  can carry it over to a Mac, a Sparcstation, an Alpha machine... whatever I like  to, if I decide to turn my back to the PC. (I *do* know that I cannot expect  to move the data without reformatting!)There are probably numerous other reasons for SCSI as well.>After all it is a floppy replacement we are taking about. 128Mb isnt all that>much, so it isnt going to replace the need of a fast fixed disk.No, not replace, but supplement. And contrary to a floppy, a MD may be fast enoughto run programs (or access data) directly off the MD. So we'll have much higherexpectations/demands, which is much better supported by SCSI than the old floppyinterface. And the price of SCSI controllers is not that high any more - isn't itsomething like a dozen large pizzas, nowadays? :-)ka.

The LC can easily handle the SCSI transfer rate of theCD300.  None of the current Macs, even the Quadras, support SCSI-2 unlessyou get a SCSI-2 Nubus Card.  You don't have to have double speed to use PhotoCD.  It's just fasterreading images off of a disk.  I think that the CD150 can handle PhotoCD,but only single session.

What happens is that after a certain variable interval of timethe video circuitry 'loses' vertical sync. It is quite apparent that theMac CPU is still ok, and the problem really seems to lie with the videocircuitry, since you can still save your documents, quit your aplpications,even pull down menus etc. (only the display is scrolling lik crazy, so it'spretty hard to hit menu items ;-)We had the original logic board replaced twice now, and the same problemhas been occurring on all boards although the inteval between occurrences hasvaried. The first board had this problem every about 1hr, more often if thecache was turned OFF (yes OFF).  This is the only symptom that is notobviously related to the video circuitry (after all the cache is on the CPUright?). The second board had the problem every about 10 minutes (we didnot keep it, rather we put the original back), the current board we havehas this problem a lot less often (has gone about a week without doing it,but did it twice within an hour yesterday).The technicians that have come out to try to figure it out seemed prettysharp and tried a number of sensible things (most of which we hadpreviously tried ourselves anyway). These included:-swapping the RAM-swapping the VRAM-swapping monitors (3 different 13" Apple RGB and 2 16" Apple RGB)-swapping cables-disconnecting HD and booting from floppy-sacrificing various small mammalsHere are some other facts:-when we put a RasterOps ProColor 32 on the NuBus, the problem is fixed (it does not occur with the internal video or the ProColor video out)-the vendor cannot reproduce the problem back in their shop on the boards that exhibit it in our lab-Apple is said to be getting a little bit pissed off at shipping us boards that they cannot find anything wrong with, and getting them shipped back as faulty according to us.Here are some speculations:-I bet that neither Apple nor the vendor has tested these boards with that much RAM and VRAM on them simultaneaously, which may have something to do with their finding it hard to reproduce the problem (though we can reproduce it with just 4Mb of RAM, so this is probably a red herring).-the vendor's representative blames 'metal in your walls' - claims that our walls have metal in them which interferes with the Mac's operation. We have another 950 in the lab which works like a charm (though it's not in the exact same spot....) Please don't tell me this is probably it, I do not want to believe it.-it's probably not poltergeists, since they do not have badges to get past security at the entrance to our site.Has anyone any ideas?

I have attempted to gather as many case histories aspossible to find some estimate of success and risk. The number of repliesprobably shows how rare this modification is but give the impression thatsuccess rates may be higher than the previous 80% estimate. 24 of 24machines were able to run at 25 mhz when no add on boards were present.This is not a scientific survey but it is the best we have to work with.Thanks to all who contributed to this poll. Issues:Speed) 25 mhz to 27.5 mhz appears to be the norm for machines withoutadd on cards. All reported machines were able to use25 mhz as long as no add on cards were present. Several AppleNubus cards were in use. No machine with the Nubus adapterwas able to go faster than 25 mhz. One wasn't even able toachieve 25 mhz with the Nubus adapter in placeAt speeds of 32 and 33 mhz, the startup sound is distorted andhi density floppy disk problems have been reported.Note: Unless specifically listed below, machines were nottested with a higher speed clock to failure. Hence,the 25 mhz operational machines may well work athigher speeds.Damage) One user reported pulling out the plating of one pad. This wasrepaired and the machine is operational. One otherreported pulling the pin out of the original clock oscillatorduring desoldering. There is one second hand report of a userputting a gash in the motherboard with a slipped soldering iron.No reports of static discharge damage.No reports of high speed operation causing damage.Then again, I also don't have any reports from users ofdefective parachutes.Add on boards) Compatibility appears to be a problem with Apple NubusAdapters. Several other add on boards have been used withsuccess. See case historiesHeat Sinks) Virtually all modified machines had a heat sink installed.These were often the TO-220 style power transistor type. Someused epoxy. Some used a dab of heat sink compound with a dabof cyanoacrylate glue. There was also use of a clamp with abolt through the hole in the motherboard.Case Histories:All speeds are the effective CPU speed (1/2 of clock oscillator). All reportedCPU versions were 20 mhz.1)  27.5 mhz operational. Ran for 10 minutes at 31 mhz before crashing.

Thisis definitely not a recommended procedure by Apple but I have done the equivalent to my CX after upgrading it to a Quadra 700. The power supply is still thestock CX's and it was able to power two Quantum LPS drives, a PLI SCSI accelerator, a Micron technologies 24 bit video board, Daystar QuickCache,New Technologies Overdrive and 20 meg of RAM simultaneously.I added a new mount for the drive by attaching angle brackets to the drivetower. The internal SCSI cable was changed to a longer flat ribbon cable ontowhich I added an extra connector about midway. The final HD was internallyterminated and the drive between the motherboard and final HD had its terminator resistor packs removed. Cooling has not been a problem and no SCSI problemsoccur with either the PLI SCSI chain or motherboard SCSI hooked into the twointernal hard drives.It works very well for me, but proceed cautiously if you wish to do the same.

The Mac has a sizeable share of the typesetting market, as in the U.S. A local magazine, Next Magazine (similar to Newsweek here), uses the Mac extensively. I have seen Sir Speedy and other franchises in Hong Kong equipped with Mac-based systems. True, the discount is not as steep as here because customers in Hong Kong cannot buy from gray market, nor are Mac being sold thru mass merchandisers like Apple does here with the Performa line. At this point the sale of Mac is handled by one exclusive distributor. On the other hand, you can always get a PC clone or in the earlier days, illegal clones of the Apple IIe.Your perception of the Mac not being too popular in Hong Kong is simply because most hobbyists and users find it much cheaper to go to one of those basement stores that sell PC clones with probably illegal copies of BIOS than to pay for a Mac.Similarly you cannot say Lotus 1-2-3 surely is not well accepted in Hong Kong because the sale is so low. May be it is because of all those places in Kowloon where illegal copies of Lotus 1-2-3 can be bought for $20 and $10 for a professional looking but illegal copies of the manuals.--  =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*= Eric Choi - Internet: Eric.Choi@p5.f175.n2240.z1.fidonet.org

I keep my Mac running all the time since it also acts as ausenet node and exchanges mail and news every half hour (I run uAccess)and receives all my faxes.I do turn off the monitors hooked up to it.  They produce more heatthan I want - it can be warm in my garage office in the summer.  I'vegot one of those handy power control centers ($25 at Fry's) to I justflip the switch in front when I start or stop working.By the way, this strategy seems to be somewhat endorsed by Apple sincetheir new Color Classic will turn off its own monitor after a certainlength of idle time.--  Michael Peirce      --   peirce@outpost.sf-bay.org--  Peirce Software     --   Suite 301, 719 Hibiscus Place--                      --   San Jose, California USA 95117--  Makers of:          --   voice: +1.408.244.6554 fax: +1.408.244.6882--             Smoothie --   AppleLink: peirce & America Online: AFC Peirce

You turn onyour computer, it heats up, and everything expands.  You turn it off, itcools off, and everything contracts.  There is a limited number of cyclesof this that any component can take before it fails.  Modern electronicsare much more robust in this respect than their predeccesors.  In factportable computers are designed with this in mind since the sleep functionthat extends battery life also greatly increaces the number of thermalcycles that occur.  As a rule of thumb, if I am not going to use mycomputer (and this includes the monitor) in the next 4-6 hours, I turn itoff (I always dim the monitor when not in use to prolong the life of thephosphor).  I tend to think that with the pace of technical innovation inthe computer industry you should be much less concerned with the fatiguelife of your equipment and more concerned with how long your particulararchitecture will be supported by hardware and software vendors. :") Charles KuehmannNorthwestern UniversitySteel Research Group

No problems.  If you were using a IIfx, that might be another story.Make sure there is only one terminator in the cabling and it must be at theend.  Some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out andothers are socketted.  These count.  If the box with internal terminationscannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to bedisabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets.  If you have 2boxes with internal terminations, the terminations in one box has to bedisabled...., etc.  I am sure that this has been covered by the "experts".My experience with SCSI boxes that connect to the Mac indicates that theymust have some software package for the Mac to 'talk' to them.  My PLI MOdrive and Sharp scanner has one for each.Good luck.Art Beattie==============================================================I only speak for myself.==============================================================

They may have other patents like this.Apple has patented their implementation of regions, which presumablyincludes the internal data structure (which has never been officiallydocumented by Apple).  Apple cannot patent the concept of a region.I'm guessing that either NuTek reverse-engineered Apple's internal datastructure for regions (I dunno if this would hold up in court), or theycame up with their own data structure.  If it's the latter, then theywon't be able to draw PICT files containing regions.  Besides PICT files,there aren't many places where regions are stored on disk.  (QuickTimemovies, perhaps?)  As long as the region isn't being stored on disk andtransferred from a Mac to a NuTek clone (or vice versa), it doesn'tmatter if NuTek uses a completely different internal data structure.I remember reading that Apple also has a patent on their ADB hardware,and that the NuTek clones would therefore be lacking an ADB port.

It had  given us flawless service until last week.  The problem: Someone in our lab  has an old 512 that was upgraded a couple years ago to a Plus with an  aftermarket SIMM/SCSI setup (Digigraphics "SIMMer").  the DB25 SCSI plug runs  through the back of the machine and attaches to the board with a 26-pin  rectangular connector.  Well, this guy had removed the back from the machine,  to put more memory in, and had disconnected the the SCSI plug.  Since the  26-pin connector is symmetrical (not keyed) he may have reinstalled it upside  down, essentially reversing the pins on the DB25.  He came in and asked if he  could try out our HD on his SCSI port (it had never been used).  Naive fools  that we are, we said o.k..  His computer failed to recognize the drive.  Now,  none of the computers in our lab will recognize it.  We tried Disk Doctor, and  it doesn't recognize anything on the SCSI chain.  Could installing the SCSI  upside down have wrecked the HD's driver board?  The drive seems to spin up  all right and unpark itself upon powerup.  The events are too coincidental to  attribute the problem to stiction.Any help greatly appreciated-Jamesjak@fff.chem.utah.edu  (NeXT Mail)

The accelerator costs about $1400 whereasthe upgrade costs $2131 (just quoted from my dealer).  However the Q700upgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21"with 8 bit depth and up to 16" at 24 bit depth (with additional VRAM).  Italso has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI, whichmakes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive.  If the improved video and SCSI features are important to you, you'rebetter off getting the Q700 upgrade, otherwise save some money and get anaccelerator.Paul

Since they aren't fixed in position on theirstainless steel pins, you might try sliding them into a slightly differentposition. On my PowerBook 100, I can slide them almost completely out ofcontact with the trackball. In fact, one of the notes from sumex on fixingthe trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its _edge_ contacts theball, not the center cylindrical area.I've done this with my PB100, and it does seem to improve the feel, butneeds to be adjusted from time to time. I just popped open one of ouroffice's PB170s, and while there isn't as much latitude for movement, onecould still adjust the roller slightly. If your PB140 is the same it mighthelp.I would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller. Ifyou can take it out, clean it with a mild soapy solution, or isopropyl alcohol. Also, be sure the ball is grease-free.If you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring, roll the ball and seeif it is actually causing the axle to spin. If all this still doesn't solve it, then maybe a new one is in order. :-(It could be an electrical connection, in which case replacement would benecessary. But my experience with both mice and trackballs has been thatdirt has been the normal problem, not an electrical malfunction.Hope this helps,Murray -- Murray M.

What I meant was having a large amount of fonts load, orsounds, or huge disk caches with a control panel other than Apple'smemory control panel.  Apple's cache is at 64K, mode 32 is on, andso is 32 bit addressing.  All extensions work by themselves or with theothers until I increase the memory used by some of them (with methodsmentioned above).Well, here's my latest followup...  I ran NOWs System Profile and gotthis information:%%% Memory info %%%Physical RAM size: 20480K.Logical RAM size: 20480K.Size of Low Memory Area: 8K.Virtual Memory: Inactive.Addressing mode: 32bit mode in use.32 bit System zone: Absent.Parity RAM: Not capable.Growable System Heap: True.Temporary memory support: Present.Tempory Memory Support: Real and tracked.Note that 32 bit System zone is absent.

This sounds like the kind of problem I had when I installed 4MBSIMMs into an LC, back before low-profile 4MB SIMMs were readilyavailable.

It also hasa 68000 itself.  Periodically I have to remove the clip (not anentirely easy thing to do) and clean the "legs" of the 68000.Larry Pina's book asserts that this is occasionally a problem withsnap on upgrades:  the 68000's "legs" will oxidize, causing unusual system errors.Well, that's me.So, I would like to do something permanent, and I think it would befairly easy to put a socket in where the 68000 currently is, andmodify the MacRescue board to plug in.  What I'm not 100% sure ofis whether it will work.  It seems to me that the two 68000s aren'tacting independently; so removing one shouldn't have any effect onthe performance of my Mac.

Where can i connect a 3 1/2" AMP-Connector>to supply my 3 1/2" HD?It is very possible to connect another internal hard disk in anymacintosh if you can find the space to put it. I have a IIsi that camewith a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped inanother 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did. First off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantumquarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for themwas stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had aproblem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together forover two months.The next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internalhard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. justsplice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboardconnector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a sparecable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be foundin any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properlysoldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility ofshorts or bad connections.Next, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard diskribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so whatI did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me anothermale connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,and is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using acrimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is notdamaged, and I can go back to the original setup.Having done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes forpower consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to thisday. In a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's ofthe drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives areintact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but itseemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signalshould be terminated at all the ends.Let me know if you have any more questions.Peter HansenBell Northern Researchpgmoffc@BNR.ca

I don't know about sys 7.1,but at least on 6.0.7, there are bugs in the Sound Manager that causeschannels to hang (with no error message). This happends when I keep achannel open for long periods - necessary for performance - and play manysounds, stopping sounds halfway. Callbacks seems not to be reliable.Then only way I can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is toinspect private variables in the channel (QHead, I think it was), and theonly way I have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an*undocumented* flag and modify it.Am I happy with this? Nope. I consider writing to SoundBase simply to getrid of the bugs.Any better suggestions?

I must say that the connections between the power supplyand the Monitor and Main Board are usable to this failure, Ram simms can bebadly connected due to some corrosion and the powersupply can be in thelastphase (lower Voltage).So you can do following if you are used to such technical terms.1) Clean all mentioned contacts with contact spray2) readjust the 5 Volt level of your powersupply3) use a calm fan and think of preventing dust blowin through the floppy!

I'mprimarily looking at 128MB drives, although I might consider 256MB ones.When looking through MacWorld and MacUser ads, the prices for the 128MB drivesseem to range from just under $1000 (for the DGR 128REM Portable, Magic 128MBPortable Fujitsu, or NuDesign 128MB from MacDirect) to about $1600 (for theFWB HammerDisk 130 and Mass Microsystems DataPak MO/128).  Different drivesuse different mechanisms - MOST, Fujitsu, Sony, Epson, probably some others.My problem is that after reading the Nov 92 MacWorld and Apr 93 MacUserreviews of these drives, I'm still not sure what to get.  So, I'm askingif anyone has had good/bad experiences with any 128MB M-O drive or can shedsome light on the wide range of prices (is spending more really buying memuch?), reliability of different drives, compatibility between them, or anything else I should probably know.Thanks.John Sasinowski

It would have the plus of RocketShare andthe minus of NuBus accelerators - no true boot off the accelerator,NuBus bottleneck to video and other I/O.Apple, it seems, will not compete with third parties here -- exceptperhaps for not-yet-available Macs like Cyclone, where a PowerPCslot might be advertised. Look for Daystar and such to make PowerPCaccelerators.One potential problem with any accelerator, though, is that it willneed a ROM companion and Apple has licensed only Radius, withRocketshare, to use any of its proprietary code.Apple is, between the lines, trying to let us know that PowerPC Macswill have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of RISCand that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those inexisting 68040 Macs. Perhaps, then, we'll see groundbreakingprices in Mac-logic board upgrades, much the same way we've seenmuch cheaper high-performance CPUs this year.First generation PowerPCs, 98601s, will also hopefully have socketedCPUs so that they'll be chip upgradeable to 98604s a year later.This should be possible in much the same way that 486s can be pulledfor clock doublers. If there is too much technical   baggage (whichI doubt since the external busses are the same size/width) to dothis, perhaps we can have CPU daughterboard, a la Powerbook, asstandard to facilitate better CPU upgrades. This is an area whereApple has fallen far behing the Intel-based world. Perhaps catchupis in order.By the way, last week's PC week had an excellent story on PowerPC,Pentium, MIPS R4000, DEC Alpha (the big four on the microprocessorfront for the forseeable future). Worth reading for technojunkies.Also, the latest PC has a cover story on Pentium. Read it, and allthe other stories about how Intel is unstoppable and preeminentright now.Once anyone is this secure, they are due to fall. Intel's marketposition will never again be as dominant as it is today (especiallyif AMD gets the go ahead to sell its 486s this week as it appears itmight). The competition from all fronts is gearing up for an awesomebattle. Apple users should be excited that PowerPC, while notguaranteed dominance, is a guaranteed winner, even if its one ofseveral.Mark

However...(2) Some VGA-type monitors can adequately deal with the video signalthe Mac uses to drive the Apple 13 or 14 inch "high resolution colordisplay"---i.e., Apple's own 640x480 mode.So, if you wish to hook one of these monitors up to your IIsi, youneed (a) an adapter that converts from the Mac DB-15 connector to theVGA-style high density DB-15 connector, *but* tells the Mac to useit's own 640x480 mode, not the VGA 640x480 mode, and (b) a VGA monitorthat can deal with the higher bandwidth of the Mac 640x480 mode overthe VGA 640x480 mode (which as I stated in (1) above, the IIsi cannotproduce).As far as (a) above is concerned, contact James Engineering, Inc. 6329 Fairmount Ave. El Cerrito, CA  94530 510-525-7350 FAX: 510-525-5740They can probably get you the right adapter.  Remember: you do *not*want the run-of-the-mill Mac-to-VGA adapter, because it will try tohave your IIsi produce the VGA mode, which it cannot (the computerwill just fail to produce any video signal at all).  Instead, you wantan adapter that connects between the Mac-style and VGA-styleconnectors, but tells the Mac to use the Apple 640x480 mode.  Sorryfor the poor terminology available for describing this distinction.As far as (b) is concerned, make sure to get a monitor that can dealwith a horizontal bandwidth of 35 KHz and a vertical retrace rate of67 Hz.  These are the spec's of Apple's 640x480 mode.  For comparison,the VGA-standard 640x480 mode uses a 31.5 KHz horizontal bandwidth anda 60 Hz. vertical retrace rate.The monitor will probably need to have auto-synch'ing capability, asthe Apple mode you'll be using isn't one of the set of standard modesin the PC compatible world.Good luck!-Fred Martin-- Fred Martin | fredm@media.mit.edu | (617) 253-7143 | 20 Ames St. Rm.

I'm a laser bigotand the first to admit it. :)I'll be using the printer to layout pages of a book I'm writing.  Thepage will include multiple fonts, PS graphics, scanned line art andmaybe greyscale pictures (not sure yet).  The quality doesn't need tobe spectacular, but it needs to be clear and readable.Printers I've been looking at:- used LaserWriters: The plus, the NT, the NTR.  Its my understanding that  only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk. True?- Personal LaserWriter (LS and NTR).  I have access to the Apple Employee  discount (I work for one of Apple's spinoffs), so I can get these reasonably  cheaply.  I've heard bad things about the LS; comments?  I'm leaning  towards the Personal NTR, cause it has a nice small footprint.- LaserWriter Select 300.  I hear it doesn't have PostScript, but I haven't  seen anything for sure.  I heard mumbles once about a "postscript upgrade."  ??- Used HP LaserJets.  I've worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and  they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?- I've seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.  Any comments on this printer?  I hate the styling (too many ouput trays),  but if its a decent printer I'll consider it.Thanks for any comments...-- *********************************************************Laura Lemay                              lemay@netcom.comwriter of trifles in shadows and blood*********************************************************

I have used MacKermit and VersaTerm onthe Mac side. I have used Procomm, Kermit, and Softerm (on OS/2) onthe PC (or PS) side. I have used non-Hardware handshaking and hardwareahdshaking cables. And know MY hands are shaking from the effort. Nothinghas allowed file transfers from the Mac to the PS.In general, I can type back and forth with no trouble, but only if both sidesare set to speeds OVER 9600 baud. I cannot send files from the Mac to thePS at all, and file transfers from the Duo to the PS are not possible.When I do a straight ascii send, I can send from the PS to the Duo flawlessly.I can send Binhex files this way quite fast, and I know that thetransmission is error free.But straight ascii sent from the Mac to the PS is full of errors.Unless, of course, I do text pacing so slow that it is like humantyping. (well, like 2-3 times faster than human typing).I would like to hear from ANYONE who has been able to transfer filesfrom a Duo 210 to a PS via modem or null modem. If you can do it, pleasetell me your EXACT combination of hardware and software. Obviously, I amtalking of a true serial port modem, not the express modem. Maybe somekind soul with access to a modem and a Duo 210 can check this out for me.Right now, I am of the opinion that it won't work at high speeds becauseof the power interrupts on the Duo, and it won't work at low speedsbecause of some crazy reason I don't understand.Could I hear from someone attesting that they can really pump informationout the serial port of a Duo 210 fast? Like via a modem or via asys-ex dump?Could anyone with a Duo help me out?? I am going absolutely INSANE.I wanna know if the problem is MY Duo, or all Duo 210s, or all Duos,or just me.Yes, I have checked the cable 1,000,000 times. And not only can I typeback and forth, but Zterm alerts the users if s/he uses hardware handshakingand CTS is down. So I know that hardware handshaking is working. And also,According to Zterm port stats, the buffer never overflows.Please help me figure out what's going on...Scott PetrackPetrack@haifasc3.vnet.ibm.com

I have a record that shows a IIsi with and without a 64KB cache.It's small enough that I will attach it.I have also measured some real programs with and without the 64 KBcache.  The speedup varies a lot from app to app, ranging from 0% to40%.  I think an average of 20%-25% is about right.  The subjectivedifference is not great, but is sometimes noticable.  A simple cachecard certainly does not transform a IIsi into something enormouslybetter.  I do not have an FPU.The conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makersoffer about the same speedup and that there is not much differencebetween 32K and 64K caches.  I bought mine from Third Wave for wellunder $150.  I have had absolutely no problems at all with it.If you get *complete* speedometer runs for a 32K cache, I'd like tosee them.  Let's check the conventional wisdom!  The so called"Performance Rating" numbers by themselves are of no interest.

Plus, it'stacky.Usually, you would smear a bit between the chip and the sink, and thenbolt or clamp the sink down, but if you don't move your Mac, gravityand the stickiness of the goo should be more than suffcient to holdthings in place.  Just make sure you remember it's in there, in caseyou tilt your Mac and jar it hard enough to shake it loose.  Youwouldn't want a loose piece of metal running around inside your Mac.

Also how much would one cost?I've had the board for over a year, and it does work with Diskdoubler,but not with Autodoubler, due to a licensing problem with Stac Technologies,the owners of the board's compression technology. (I'm writing thisfrom memory; I've lost the reference. Please correct me if I'm wrong.)Using the board, I've had problems with file icons being lost, but it'shard to say whether it's the board's fault or something else; however,if I decompress the troubled file and recompress it without the board,the icon usually reappears. Because of the above mentioned licensingproblem, the freeware expansion utility DD Expand will not decompressa board-compressed file unless you have the board installed.Since Stac has its own product now, it seems unlikely that the holesin Autodoubler/Diskdoubler related to the board will be fixed.Which is sad, and makes me very reluctant to buy Stac's product sincethey're being so stinky.

I have a IIsi that camewith a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped inanother 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did. First off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantumquarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for themwas stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had aproblem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together forover two months.The next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internalhard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. justsplice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboardconnector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a sparecable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be foundin any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properlysoldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility ofshorts or bad connections.Next, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard diskribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so whatI did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me anothermale connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,and is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using acrimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is notdamaged, and I can go back to the original setup.Having done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes forpower consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to thisday. In a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's ofthe drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives areintact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but itseemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signalshould be terminated at all the ends.Let me know if you have any more questions.Peter HansenBell Northern Researchpgmoffc@BNR.ca

The critical information from the neuron is inthe firing frequency (maximum about 100 action potentials perseconds), and not in the amplitude of the signal or in details of thesignal shape. So the resolution of about 0.4 % you get with an 8 bitconvertor is more then sufficient.AC coupling does not have to be a problem either, since in many casesyou are not interested in the DC level. My pre amplifier is AC coupledalso. The critical point is the lowest frequency that will pass. Ifthe cutoff point is to high, the action potentials will be slightlydistorted. But even that normally does not matter since it is theoccurrence of the spike that is important. However, I do want to know what exactly I can expect before I startbattling with the toolbox to get it going. As yet I have no clue wereto start looking for the technical specifications.Peter.  roes@vax.oxford.ac.uk

Apple has really confused people with this whole thing. I thinkwe'll be answering this question for about the next year or so. There isno "option" to get an FPU on a C650. What you have is a choice of CPUs:there is the 68LC040 that does not have an integrated FPU like the full'040 and is only present in the base 4/80 model of the C650 (AppleUSA).And there is the full '040 which you get when you order anything otherthan the base 4/80 configuration. Therefore, since you have ordered oneof the 8MB versions with on-board Ethernet models you will not begetting the LC040. But even if you wanted to have the LC040 you wouldn'tbe able to order a C650 with 8MB RAM, on-board Ethernet and an LC040.It's not an "option."    Also, a note to people out there that have 4/80 C650s and C610sthinking that there is an optional FPU, the '040 class chip cannotrecognize an external FPU, so there is no socket on the motherboard fora FPU chip and you cannot go out and purchase an FPU on a PDS card orsomething like that. The only way to get an FPU in these machines is toreplace the LC040 with a full '040. And if you have a C610, you will notneed to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the LC040 with thefull '040, but if you have a 4/80 C650 you do need to have a heat sink.-Hades

(no joke)  Here is thedeal. We can get this grant to do a study on if it is more feasible to do adisection via the computer or via the real thing.  My problem is I was somehowdrawn into this project (being done by students who want to go Mac but knowNADA about them, being the man mac man on campus, guess who they came to?) so Iwnt to know what would probably be the best hardware to fill the follwoinglist?  Right now we are looking at the C650 8/80 and the 2vx 5/80 platforms.Ok here it goes:We are using cd-rom, so ought we go with the internal Apple Cd-romsoffered as options in the 650 and vx or go external. It is a matter of priceand reliability, the second being VERY important.How much RAM?  I was thinking 5-8 more leaning towards 8?  What do youthink?Ok, called apple educational discounts and they said their keyboard(extended) is 160.30. Is it better to go with the Apple and their long timegreat wear and tear record, or is there a 3rd party extended keyboard that isjust a reliable?  Price?Printers:  One color printer we are presently leaning towrds theThermal Wax Tektronic 200e or 200i (Probably the e as we are going to limitaccess so we don't needed the i's networkability)  So, what do you think interms of color printers?  Different brand?  Kind (Dye Sublimation?  Ink Jet?) Price? Companies?  1800 #s?  Also, we are looking to get a laser printer orsuch to network into the whole lab for noraml printing.  The fornt runner isthe Apple Pro650 (is that right don't have my notes here?) at 1650. Suggestions?  We have kids using these things all day if this lab goes throughand they know nothing about it for the most part. It has to be reliable, easyto maintain, and economical (ie, not high priced paper cartidges, etc).Finally, and this is my little dig into the Project. What about nettingthese things?  We have ether nearby and I would like to slap the macs on thenet, but, server?  Individual ether?  Forget about it it is going to beastronomically priced and the school is going to laugh at you when you askthem?Little more info, I am a Poli Sci major who just happens to know alotabout macs but this is a bit out of my league, not to mention I don't have thetime to go and look for all of this stuff.

We also have a new spare Connor 40MBdisk which we would like to use. The idea is to replace the brokenfloppy drive with the new hard disk, but there seems to be someproblems:The internal SCSI cable and power cable inside the cx has onlyconnectors for one single hard disk drive.If I made a ribbon cable and a power cable with three connectors each(1 for motherboard, 1 for each of the 2 disks), would it work?Is the IIcx able to supply the extra power to the extra disk?What about terminators? I suppose that i should remove the resistorpacks from the disk that is closest to the motherboard, but leave theminstalled in the other disk.The SCSI ID jumpers should also be changed so that the new disk getsID #1. The old one should have ID #0.It is no problem for us to remove the floppy drive, as we have anexternal floppy that we can use if it won't boot of the hard disk.Thank you!----------------------------------------------------------------------Torbj|rn Rognes                            Email: rogntorb@idt.unit.no

It can be purchased with a "Macbundle", which includes a hardware-handshaking cable and FaxSTF software.The bundle adds between $35 and $60 to the price of the modem, dependingon the supplier.  It is true that the modem has no Mac-specific docs,but it doesn't require much 'tweaking' (aside from setting &D0 in theinit string, to enable hardware handshaking).For more information on the ZyXEL, including sources, look at various files on sumex-aim.stanford.edu, in info-mac/report.Disclaimer:  I have no affiliation with ZyXEL, though I did buy a ZyXELa U1496E modem.

(Around 5 MB.)I have a Quadra 950. I have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s.         (using block-mode transfers)I have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can         achieve 6.8 MB/s.Let's say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.It is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer,then transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/sresult in an overall 3.8 MB/s.  Too slow!)So I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer, Step 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer.Step 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer.Step 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer.        ...Step n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer.Step n+1: Send the nth MB out card.Even though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously,and the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho')each of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers wereexecuted one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.Why?Is the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can bothaccess data at the same time.)Is the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to usethe same bus to mac RAM?Is there anything I can do?--David+---------------------------------------------------------------------+| David Blume            | "I get tired thinking of all the things I  || dcb@wdl1.wdl.loral.com |  don't want to do."  --Bukowski, _Barfly_  |+---------------------------------------------------------------------+

(Sorry for length).To increase the MacIISi speed to 25MHz or 33MHz the clock must be changedfrom 40MHz to 50MHz or 64MHz respectively.This is done by going to a static-free work station or putting somealuminum foil down to work on.1. Open up the Si by lifting the tabs at the back of the case.2. Remove the Hard Disk by disconnecting the power and SCSI cables,spreading the tabs, and lifting the drive out.3. Remove the flopy drive.4. Remove the power supply by spreading the tab in front and liftingthe supply straight up and out.5. Remove the fan by pressing the ears together at the back, bottomside of the fan and lifting straight up and out.6. Remove the Mother Board by spreading the tabs on the left andright side of the board and sliding the board forward thenlifting the board out. (all connectors on the back of theboard must be removed first)7. Desolder the 40MHz clock (the one closest to the memory modules).This is not easy even for a skilled solderer.8. Get an IC socket with the round pins and remove four of the pinsby pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers.9. Put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder them in.10.Insert a 50MHz or 64MHz clock.11.Put large power transistor heat sink's on the processor chip and the other large chip just to the right of the processor andfigure some way to hold the heat sync's in place. I made asimple clamp by putting a four inch screw up through the holein the board between the two chips. Mount the screw usinginsulated washers. Screw a cross member down over the heatsync's to hold them in place. Don't use too much pressure.12.

I made a call for reports of failures last week. No reports have arrivedhere. Locally, in Seattle there is a reported CPU damage due to the userslipping with the iron and putting a gash into the board -- not exactlya problem due to the CPU running too fast.I think it would be nice to have a poll to report top speeds and systemconfigurations including PDS and Nubus cards which were used.

It seemsthat SE ROMs won't support those "features". Okay, I guess I should have somehow known that this was the case.Let the buyer beware, huh Apple?Be that as it may, I have been thinking about the problem and I'm puzzled. Why  can't a defencieny in the ROM be made up for in software. I write software for a living(on unix platforms) and I don't understand the "it justcan't be done" responses I've gotten from those I haveasked so far.  Isn't Mode32, or somesuch piece of  soft-ware, just such a fix. Anyway, I was hoping someone knowledgeableabout Mac internals could set me straight: is it simplyimpossible for a mac SE to print grayscale, or couldsomeone armed with enough info and a little pro-gramming experience cook something up that wouldsupplement the ROM's capabilities?Also, how does one know if one's mac cansupport the grayscale and photograde that the Select 300is supposedly capable of? ( Short of buying the printerand trying it out like I did)Thanks for your help. Bill Wrightwgw@netcom.com

As you can wellimagine, I got nearly one hundred responses, so I figured I'd thankyou all here instead of individually.The tallies:I got one vote for A/UX, which runs on the Macintosh.I got several nays for Commodore's 3000UX system.Most people agreed that SGI's were nice, and very very expensive.Some (devoted) Sun users nearly insisted that I try to find a usedSun, say a 3/60 or 3/80.About a dozen people told me how they love their NeXT...only now NeXTis out of the hardware business (see below).And most of the other 85+ people said:  Get a 486 box, and run someversion of Unix that's available either in the Public Domain orcommercially.=============And so I weighed my options.  What stood out, in my opinion, was thatthere were several different versions of Unix available on one system:the 486 (PC) architecture.  If I bought a Sun, I'd have to use SunOS.If I bought a (used) NeXT, I'd have to use NeXTSTEP (see below).  Adnauseum.But with a PC, I can run Linux, which is a small user-friendly (?)flavor that uses shared libraries to cut down on volume, although Ihear its networking abilities aren't up to speed with 386bsd, anotherPD (==free) port (which takes up a lot more space).  I can purchaseBSD386 (commercial product) if I choose.  There are several othercommercial packages available.So, what I've found out (after pricing systems, etc.), is that I canget a really good Unix workstation for as little as ~$2500.  Includingsource code!Or, for ~$3500-4000, I can get an unbelievable EISA bus 486-66DX2system, fully blown, and run single user BSD386.What I'm really excited about, though, is NEXTSTEP for Intel.  NeXTchanged into a software company only, and they are releasing their OSfor PC's.  I've used NeXT's before, and I absolutely loved them.Everyone who wrote me about NeXT (or NEXTSTEP) commented on thedeveloper's environment, and how well designed the whole package is.===========So, my choice is to:1)  Wait for the mail on Monday, so I can read what NEXTSTEP's systemrequirements are2)  If I'm wowed on what they say, I'll buy a system that fits intotheir criteria    2a)  Get NEXTSTEP3)  If I'm wowed, but I can't afford it yet (most likely), I'll buy asystem that fits their criteria    3a)  Get Linux or 386bsd, as a temporary learning experience so Ican save up for NEXTSTEP4)  If I'm not sufficiently wowed (least likely), I'll buy a systemthat is slightly less blown out (like a 486DX 25, ISA) and put Linuxor 386bsd on it.================Again, thanks to everyone around the net.

I think I have a problem with the stereo sound output on my Quadra900, but I am not totally sure because my roomate has the same problemon his PowerBook 170.  Any info or experience anyopne has would begreatly appreciated.When I hook my Quadra up to my home stereo system, the following typesof sounds (mono, as far as I can tell) all play fine through BOTHspeakers:system beeps  (already provided ones such as Indigo and ones I record)Armor AlleySpectreSpaceward Ho!But, the following games only play out of the left channel:LemmingsOut of This World  (awesome game, BTW)Glider 4.0OIDSBut still, STEREO system beeps do play in stereo, through BOTH speakers.(The one I'm specifically referrring to is Apocolyptic Beginning, whichmy roommate downloaded from some ftp site (sumex?))All of the symptoms are the same on my rommates 170 (he can't runOOTW because he doesn't have color).We're both running system 7.1Does anyone with Lemmings or the other three games I mentioned above getsound out of both speakers on a Mac II class, Quadra, LC, PowerBook 140 orgreater, Centris, SE/30, etc... (stereo) machine?I used to have a Mac II, and I sort of rememeber Lemmings playing instereo on that machine, not just on the left channel.  (I could bemistaken, though.  If there were a problem with the Quad 900's and PB170's, I am wondering why the system beeps still play in stereo?  If thereisn't a problem with our machines, I wonder why the 4 games above areapparantly written to support only one channel of stereo when theycould just use mono sounds so the mono sound would at least come out ofboth speakers  (like Spectre, etc. do)?Quadra 900's and PowerBook 170's have the same ROMS (to my knowledge),so maybe this is a ROM problem?  (if so, though, why wouldn't System 7.1patch over this problem?)Thanks for any help you can provide!Doug Bookdpb@sdchemw2.ucsd.edu

I bought the APS Quantum 240 zerofootprint drive in May '92 (back when they still used two separate LEDs on thefront panel and the case was metal).  While traveling with it (it was in mySE/30 Mac bag, on top of the Mac) this past winter, one of the plastic tabsholding the front panel on broke, so that the right side of the front panelwas coming forward away from the rest of the drive.  I lived with this situationuntil it became completely intolerable (which more or less coincided with anetwork shutdown at school and a trip out of town I had to take, which gave mesome dead time during which to have the drive sent out).I called APS for an RMA # and got one, with no questions asked about how thetab got broken (it was handled a little roughly by airline baggage handlers --though nothing else was damaged [well, except for the internal speaker in mymodem, which wasn't that well glued down to begin with] -- yeah, yeah, I'mnever flying with my SE/30 again).  And when I called back to ask whether Icould send it in a little later rather than right away, they had no problemwith that -- even when I exceeded the normal valid period for an RMA # by aday (they're usually good for 10 days).  The front panel was replaced underwarranty, and the drive was shipped back quickly (I mailed it first classinsured on a Saturday by noon from L.A. to Missouri, and it came back by FedEx by Friday [I don't know exactly what day it came back because I wastraveling that week from Wednesday afternoon to Sunday afternoon]).The only thing that could've been bad was that the first service rep I talkedto, in an attempt to prevent jeopardizing my data, suggested that I take thedrive mechanism out and send just the case.  Unfortunately, I discovered theday I was mailing the thing, that would necessitate breaking the littleseal and thus voiding the warranty!  Oh, well.Alalbert@seas.ucla.edu

Any replies encouraged.  Thanks in ad-> vance.You may have been emailed this, but the IIsi's power supply is not rated tohandle the GC board.  Remember when the si came out and everyone complainedabout it's power supply.  This is one result of apple providing a low-costcomputer and I think they got a lot of flack for having a relatively high endcomputer (at the time anyways) that couldn't even support their own videoboard.  Even if this isn't what is causing your problems, you might developone later.Eric

I love my portable system (got a color home setupalso. Mac II). Reasoning was that MATLAB programs at school and othersimulations of dynamic control systems sometimes took hours (orovernight) to run, tying up my Mac II. I got the PB100 with fast modemto do light work and on-the-run stuff. I figured I'd give it to mylittle sister next year when she goes to college. It's running System7.1 now without any problems. Also I sometimes do DEC4015 terminalemulations with MATLAB on our university's VAX_VMS (nice thing that itbenchmarks itself as an average of 230 times faster than a mac IIfx).So, the PB100 just does graphical output and terminal emulation (nottoo hard at all for it). It was a FABULOUS setup !!!!  :)  Weeee!!!(By the Way, all MATLAB software was on class accounts. I was also theTA for a class that used SIMULAB/SIMULINK. We had site-license andtake-home, then-destroy later site-release licenses... No piratingthere, incase you're wondering.... Great Program!!! )Just like to add, whatever future system you get, you can almost neverget enuff memory....

If you're at all interested in this merchandise, please e-mail me:djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu I'm compacting my system and moving to a single monitor system, so I havetwo monitors and cards for sale. Nothing at all is wrong with these pieces,I'm just wanting to conserve desk space, and get all of my info from onescreen. I'd prefer to sell to people near Austin and surrounding areas (withindriving distance - like an hour away perhaps), but I CAN ship to you if youdon't live near here. Only problem is that I didn't keep the original boxesfor the monitors, but I'm confident that my few months of full-time servicein the shipping room will enable me to safely package the monitors andflip it in your direction. Details: Mirror Full Page Display (monochrome) w/nubus card:---------------------------------------------------**SOLD** Sony 1304 14" color monitor:----------------------------What's to say? It got top ratings in last year's MacUser report. It's a SONY,Trinitron, arguably the best (but I'd rather not argue that point).It's a great monitor, in great shape, but I'm going to a bigger screen,and although I'd like to keep it, finances don't justify it. Still selling for $599 at MacLand (where I bought it originally - notincluding shipping), will sell for **$400** [was $475 orig. asking price](plus shipping). Again, make an offer if that sounds unreasonable.  RasterOps 24si (24-bit accelerated, hardware zoom/pan, 4 meg RAM):------------------------------------------------------------------Renamed the 24sx a few months after I bought it, this board is for 13"monitors, providing **accelerated 24-bit**, hardware zoom/pan, NTSC mode(you can plug it into something like the RasterOps Video Expander and outputNTSC), and 4 RAM slots that use 1 meg or 4 meg SIMMS for GWorld RAM, or aRAM disk. Software included for such functions. 4 meg of RAM included (1 megSIMMS). Selling for $605 at Bottom Line (without the RAM - add $100), I'm asking**$425** [was $525 orig. asking price](shipping included this time,it's just a card). Original box and packaging. I'd actually prefer to sellthe Sony monitor and this card together, so if you want both, drop me e-mailand make a "bundled offer" for these items. If you check the May 93 (or was it Feb 93) Macworld mag, you'll find that the24sx (or 24si - same thing) board did extremely well in the tests for 13-14"640 x 480 24-bit boards. Also supports up to 1120 (or so) x 512 in 24-bit, soyou can fit two pages width-wise via the scrolling desktop thang. It's a greatboard, but I'm going to a 19" monitor, and it can't help me there.------------ Cheers. -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Dan Keldsen            |  Are you now, or have you ever been:djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu |  a.

This week's MacWeekreports that Apple is probably planning a drop in August.  My guessis that it may come sooner if Apple decides to  change the pricestructure upon release of the multimedia units this summer.Your price looks pretty good at about $50 more then I payed formine last month.  I would have rather waited for one of the newmachines this sommer (like the Cyclone) but the resale value of myIIci would have not been squat by then.  Thus, financing forced meto purchase now.  I'm happy with the machine and won't feelbetrayed at all when Apple cuts the price to less then $1000 nextweek (heh).Bottome line:  If the C650 does what you want, buy it.  If you waituntil the Cylcones come out for a price break then you might aswell wait for the PowerPCs to come out for another price break andthen the units which follow them.  You may save some money butyou've lost a lot of time when you could have been using thecomputer.  Face it, Apple's prices are going to be in a continuousstate of flux.  At least they aren't going to try raising themagain (grin).-JohnKomp@leonardo.src.honeywell.com

As a result mail ordercompanies have to obtain their machines by the grey market.This market is supplied with machines from authorised resellers who havemore machines than they can sell.  They come into this state of affairsby overordering either accidentally or deliberatly to get a betterwholsale price from Apple.  In either case they often obscure the serialnunber to protect their identity.  As a result the warranty is void.You may save on sales tax but you have to pay for shipping.I should also point out that mail order companies cannot get lower pricesthatn the high volume authorised dealers unless they buy below dealercost.  As a result the only way they can sell cheaper is by cutting costsand trimming margins.  Unfortunatly they dont seem to be doing too well. The lowest prices I have been quoted mailorder do not beat the lowestprices available from authorised local dealers.They are even further away from educational prices.-ERik Speckman

I'm usingRetrospect 1.3Ci,and my only luck with getting the drive to work has been with a Mac IIci,which hasnow unfortunately gone to another department.  Ideally, we want to attach it to our Quadra 950 setup.  I can't seem toget theRetrospect software to recognize the media at all.  When in the "Devices"dialog,it can see the DAT device, but comes up with, firstly, 'Running', secondly'Media Failure' and then immediately 'Contents Unknown'.  This does nothappen with theMac IIci setup, which simply says 'Ready'.  I'm hoping someone else will have had similar problems but found somesolution... I know some others who have had problems with DAT devices and their Quadra,but they havea Mac IIci which they can use!  THE SYMPTOMSSystem software is 7.1, also didn'twork with 7.0.1  I have tried the following:  Turn off all extensions, except Retrospect SCSI (required)  Tested on a variety of machines:  Quadra, IIsi, and LC (at least).  Connected no other SCSI devices  Tested all varieties of SCSI termination etc.  Replaced the DAT unit with a new one (Yes!  we got that desperate!)  Read the Retrospect manual (EVEN MORE DESPERATE :))Replies via email would be greatly appreciated... thanks in advance. I'll post anysolutions to this group.Cheers,Matt.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ______  Matthew Riddle                                      matthew@ariel.unimelb.edu.au| ---- | Science Multimedia Teaching Unit                               Tel 61 3 344 6400||    || Faculty of Science                                             Fax 61 3 344 5803| ---- | University of Melbourne                |   -- | AUSTRALIA                                                 Myopinions are my own! ====== ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I love the Mac interface and any numberof the features, but am sorely dissapointed with the speed. I use macs dailyand am a Moc consultant for OSU Statistics department; I'm familiar with almostevery model out there, and my experience is that both the Amiga and the AtariST simply "blow the Mac out of the water" in terms of performance. At this timeI would in general say that the other advantages of the Mac outweigh theadvantages of the Amiga or the ST (and Falcon), but I really wish Apple wouldget their heads together on speed... :-((((( They could take a real lesson inmuli-tasking from the Amiga OS or the MultiTOS in the Atari Falcons too :-((( > I'm still happy with my ci, but I don't understand why the performance is> so bad (comparatively).

If I had my choice, I would go with Mac in most aspects, but add thespeed and superior Multi-Tasking of the other platforms.As for the original topic; Trying to compare *just the chip* in a machine seemsalmost worthless. A fast 386 with a wiz-bang graphics accelerator will befaster in productivity for many applications than a even a stock Quadra. Add agraphics accelerator to a 486 and you *really fly*. Of course, add one the theQuadra and then you're blowing the 486 away... etc...> Oh well, y'all got $2.00 worth for the price of $0.02I think mine was only worth $0.01.......---------------------------------------------------------------------->|-! -David Butler- dhbutler@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu  "This is not a novel to be tossed away lightly;   it should be thrown with great force."         -Dorothy Parker

He did not tell me HOW I could change it usingResEdit, and I have lost his e-mail address.Could he or any one else please tell me what to do?I assume that the relevant resource is zSet, but I do not know, andI have no template for that resource. If you have a TMPL for the correctresource, I would be grateful to receive it. That way, I could play arounda bit and maybe get my Duo to do something useful with its serial port.(other than Appletalk).BTW, I believe that when the port stats says that maximum in buffer is3074 bytes, that that means increasing the buffer will help, if you areusing hardware handshaking. I can cram text data pretty fast into my Duo,and can monitor that CTS is being lowered, but the buffer never gets beyond3074 (out of 4096) bytes.

Sean O'Casey in _The White Plague_ by Frank Herbert.Hmmm... that's not quite right.  The Performa 600 is Real Darn Closeto the IIvx (but a better buy IMO).  I also don't think they are somuch a 'low-cost business solution', but a low-cost _home_ solution.Why else bundle at ease (among other things)?  Hardly a businessapplication. What do you mean by 'no "retail price"'.  Quite the contrary, I think.The price is darn near the same all across the country.  That (again,IMO) was one of the selling points of the performas -- ie: no hagglingrequired.  Kinda like the Saturn (car) of the computer set.  Oneprice, medium performance, ready to go.When I shopped for my Performa (600CD), the difference between Sears(*sigh), Montgomery Wards, Silo (*sigh), Circuit City (*sigh*) andBizmart (*sigh*) couldn't have been $100.00.  Why I chose one over theother was based solely on availability and a friendly salesman whowent the extra mile (when did you last hear that about someone whosells Apples?).  Admittedly, except for Montgomery Wards (and Isuspect I was just lucky) all of the salesfolk I spoke to didn't knowdidly about the computers, peecee or mac.  But then, neither did anyof the  Apple dealers I spoke with...If you would've told me a year ago that I would buy a Macintosh fromMontgomery Wards I woulda laughed for a long, long time.  Go figure.I'm *real* happy with my Performa.  Oh, and I bought the ApplePerforma Plus monitor (vs. buying 3rd party).  Happy with thatdecision as well.  I walked in, plopped down some cash, and walked outwith a spankin' new computer the day before Christmas.  -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------Instrument Approach Procedures Automation             DOT/FAA/AMI-230---------------------------------------------------------------------Bryan D.

There are two approaches:1. If your power cord is the kind that detaches from the back of themonitor (most common) you can get a *replacement* power cord that will gofrom the monitor to the back of the computer.2. You can get an adpater that connects to the plug end of the existingpower cord and provides the proper end that plugs into the back of thecomputer.Both cost about the same (aprox. $5) and are available from many computerstores (clone dealers are usually better at having these things and atgood prices). Power cords are standard, so you don't have to go lookingfor some special thing at a Mac store.

When Ioriginally purchased it, I experienced the failure to boot problem.  Thiswas fixed soon after by a ROM upgrade on the hard drive.Lately a similar problem has been occuring.  When the computer ispowered on the HD light flashes a few times and then I am giventhe "no disk to boot from" icon.  However, upon turing thecomputer off and on again the drive ALWAYS boots up just fine.  Furthermore, if instead of turning the power on and off I press the reboot button the same problem occurs.  But, as I said, turning the poweroff and on always works.This problem is different from the 1989 boot problem in that beforeit often required several power off and ons to get it to boot.Does anybody have any suggestions as to what the problem is or howit can be fixed?I'm wondering if it's getting old and requires more time to "come up to speed" now.  Is there a PRAM or SCSI setting thatallows me to tell the computer to wait a little longer before trying to access the HD?Thanks!Altan J.

I've put together a list andindicated what I think each item is worth.  This is just my estimate, and Iam very open to any offers, including trades.  I'm currently looking forsome CD-ROMs that will work with a Mac CD ROM player CD Caddies, HD floppy disks, any used Macintosh software, a 387-33Mhz Co-Processor, or basically anything you have lying around (cans of soup, the neighbor's cat, etc...)  Make me an offer, no offer will be overlooked... I really want to get rid of this stuff...Ok, Here's the list:52 Meg 3.5" SCSI Hard Drive.  Conner Model #CP-3150.  I bought this from a guyat a swap meet to use with my Macintosh.  Unfortunately, I can't seem to get it to work with the SCSI controller in my computer.  Theguy tested it with his PC, and printed out a copy of the Norton Disk Doctor report which says it has no bad sectors. (I'll send you a copy) I was dumb enough not to get his phone number, so I can't return it to him. The drive has many jumpers on it, (which I don't know how to set) so maybe that's the problem.  I was quite disappointed that it didn'twork so I'm trying to minimize my losses.~$4552 Meg 3.5" SCSI Hard Drive. Conner Model #CP-3150.  Same situation as above.I bought both of these drives from the same guy.  Despite the differentmodel numbers they are the same exact drive.  Same report from NDD(I have one for each drive) will be included.~$4540 Meg SONY 3.5" SCSI Hard Drive.  SONY Model #SRD2040A.  The drive mechanism is completely trashed.  This hard drive was in my computer (Mac SE) andhad a stiction problem.  Well, repeated banging on the side of thecomputer resulted in a head crash (yes, metal scraping metal) whichwas not too pleasant to listen to.  Still the SCSI controllercard is in good working order, and can be used for parts, or a project.~$2065 Meg Seagate 5.25" HH SCSI Hard Drive.  Model #ST-277N.  I originally boughtthis drive, because it had a small stiction problem, and I though thatI could fix it.  Well I determined that the drive mechanism was fine,and that it was a controller problem.  (motor controller wasn't sendingproper signals.)  Well, after taking the controller off the drive, looking at it, and putting it back together, I realized that Iaccidentally severed one of the small flat cables that connect the drive to the controller.  I tried to solder it, but I'm not that goodat soldering so I couldn't do it.  Worked perfectly before I messedup.  I used it as a temporary drive when the SONY (above) crashed onme.  Also loaded the drive with about twenty Mac applications,worth well over $1000.  (Claris CAD, MS Word 5.0, Think C,Excel, and many others) I think all it needs is a resoldering of that cable.  You also get allthe software on the drive. (if you can accept being a pirate)  I only ask that you delete my data files from the drive.  I was really angrywhen I broke that connection, and then couldn't fix it.  I just don't have time to play with it any more.~$65AT&T ISDN 7500 Modem.  This is for use on digital phone systems.  If you knowwhat this is or would like technical information on it, let me know.  Ihave some tech documents on it.  Is supposed to be the same thing as anAT&T digital phone, but without the phone part.  It seems to be in  working order (passes self test perfectly OK).  I have no idea how this is worth...   Let me know if you're interested.Motorola 68881 CoProcessor.  I haven't tested this one out yet, but if anyone is interested I will get it tested out, to make sure that it works.  Ihad trouble using it with my accelerator board, but then I spoke to themanufacturer of the board and found out it couldn't be used without another controller chip.  When I was looking around to buy one new, theprices were around $100.  I will guarantee this to work.~$65CGA Card.  Half-Length. 8-bit.  Wasn't working last time I checked (althoughI think I was using a bad monitor)~$55.25"360K Floppy Drive.  IBM Drive Type 1355.  Guaranteed to work, because when I took it out of the PC, it was working!~$255.25" 360K Floppy Drive.  Toshiba Model Number ND-08DE-A.  Guaranteed to work.  Came out of same PC as above.~$255.25"Floppy Drives.  Can't guarantee that these will work.  I don'teven know if they are low or high density drives.  I don't haveany method of testing them.Panasonic Model number: JU-455-5 ACG.  There's anothernumber on it: 2626-361723.Panasonic Model number: JU-475-2 AGG.  There's alsoanother number on it: H3649-101457Toshiba Model Number ND-08DE.  Virtually identical to the one above.Each Drive ~$103.5" PS/2 Drive.  These things are proprietary, so I can't test it, but Ithink it works.  Not sure if it's high density or low density, but Isuppose someone who is looking for one would know.  Model NumberDFL413C04A.  I think these things are expensive to replace.  ~$35MFM Hard Drive Controller Cards.  I've got three of these, and I have no wayof testing them.  Two of them are 8-bit cards, and one is a sixteen bitcard with a floppy controller built in.~$10 for the 8-bits ~$15 forthe 16-bit card w/floppy.Interesting cable.  Seems to convert from a VGA plug to an EGA plug.  That is,standard nine-pin to VGA 15 pin. Made by Hewlett Packard.  Part No.D1181-80020~$10I've sold stuff like this before, and it was a huge success, with many satisfied people trading or bartering stuff they didn't need anymore.  I usually ship through the U.S. Postal Service (haven't had any problems yet) and the shipping costs will be split or negotiated.Well, that's all folks.  As I said before, no offer will be refused.  If you can convince me to give OCit to you instead of throwing it out, TRY!  I hateto throw away stuff...-Waynewdempsey@athena.mit.edu(617)-225-9349

You will see the floppy disk and    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do    this. Unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the backof the mac. 3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you    need release. 4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed    to release it.                                            5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful    here.7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from slidingposteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly thenlift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.8)  Congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's SIMM    slots.9)  The six big slots are for VRAM. One usually must install all six to    gain useful video modes. All SIMMS (RAM or VRAM)  installed with theirchips facing the front of the motherboard.    The four smaller sockets in front are for RAM SIMMS. Install SIMMS insets of four into these sockets. Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarelyand firmly into a fully upright position.10) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly intoplace while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.

The serial number had been removed and replaced with a non-standardnumber (probably from CDA computers). Consequently, the Apple repair man couldnot do ANY warrenty repairs.

I received a response from someone at Seagate (Sorry I trashed the message) stating that most newer drives (Seagates at the least) can very well compensate for gravity.  This means that a horizontally formatted drive can be later placed vertically with no data integrity problems.  The only way that newer drives cannot work is if you have varying forces (shaking, bouncing, etc) so don't place the drive on it's side on a rocking chair :).  What constitutes a 'newer' drive I don't know, try calling your drive manufacturer.  I have a Quantum LP240S internal, and since I got it a month ago, I am guessing it's 'newer'.-t

Top threecontenders seem to be AT&T Paradyne, ZyXEL, and US Robotics. ZyXEL has thebiggest "cult following", and can be had for under $300, but I ignored itbecause I need something with Mac software, which will work without anytweaking.The AT&T Dataport earns nearly unanimous praises for reliability. They arebackordered at the moment, probably because of the special $299 price ineffect until May. Its fax capabilities are worse than that of the other twomodems. WARNING: AT&T ads say that the modem comes with a Mac kit (cables &all), and has lifetime warranty. This applies *only* when you orderdirectly from Paradyne! I called ElekTek (one of the distributors), andthey wanted to charge me $16 for cable, and gave only 1 year warranty...USR Sportster for the Mac is also highly (but not as highly) recommended;it's only $250 from ClubMac, and if you are willing to roll your own cableand don't care about the FAXstf software, you can get the generic modelfrom PC outlets for $190.All this assuming that you don't have a rich uncle, and can't afford aMotorola Codex...  :-(    I ended up ordering the Dataport; we'll see howit works in two weeks or so.-- Eric Behr, Illinois State University, Mathematics Departmentbehr@math.ilstu.edu   or   behr@ilstu.bitnet  (please avoid!)
