Tough talk is done by both sides.When an arab leader is menacing to throw all jews in the water is also tough talk,I think. And killing people is mildly agressive (justified, in your opinion if they are israeli soldiers, justified, in others' opinion if they are jews, notjustified at all in others opinion).When Brad wrote the article about 3 Israelis killed, ther was a lot of pride and satisfaction in his lines.

In their names we demand justice.In April 1915, the Turkish government began a systematically executed de-population of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a genocidal extermination. This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusivelyruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The result: 1.5 million murdered, 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolenand plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3,000 years of Armenian civilizationon those lands. Today, the Turkish government continues to scrape clean anyvestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Today's Turkishgovernmental policy is to re-write the history of the era, to manufacturedistortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In the face of refutation ad nauseam, the Turkish Historical Society and cronies shamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy merely demonstrates that in the modern era, genocide is an effective state policy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. A crime unpunished is a crime encouraged. Adolf Hitler took this cue less than 25 years after the successful genocide of the Armenians.Turkey claims there was no systematic deportation of Armenians, yet...Armenians were removed from every city, town, and village in the whole of Turkey! Armenians who resisted deportation and massacre are referred to as "rebels".Turkey claims there was no genocide of the Armenians, yet...Turkish populationfigures today show zero Armenians in eastern Turkey, the Armenian homeland.Turkey claims Armenians were always a small minority, yet...Turkey claims Armenians were a "threat".In a final insult to the victims, the Republic of Turkey sold the bones of approximately 100,000 murdered Armenians for profit to Europe.Today, the Turkish government is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. Thesuccess of this genocide is hangs over the heads of Turkey's Kurdishpopulation.The Armenians demand recognition, reparation, return of Armenian land andproperty lost as a result of this genocide.ARMENIANS DEMAND JUSTICE                              ERMENILER ADALET ISTIYOR-- David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | "Armenia has not learned a lesson inS.D.P.A.

Zionism agrees with the basic tenetof anti-Semitism, namely that Jews cannot live with non- Jews.The history and roots of the Holocaust go back a long way. Whilethe industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942,its roots were firmly placed in the 19th Century. Jewishaspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national strugglesin Europe. When the hopes for liberation throughbourgeois-democratic change were dashed, other alternatives forimproving the lot of the Jews of Europe achieved prominence.The socialist Bund, a mass movement with enormous following, hadto contend with opposition from a new and small, almostinsignificant opponent, the political Zionists.  In outline thesetwo offered diametrically opposed options for Jews in Europe.While the Bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest ofEurope's workers, the Zionists were proposing a new programmeaimed at ridding Europe of its Jews by setting up some form of aJewish state.Historically, nothing is inevitable, all depends on the balance offorces involved in the struggle. History can be seen as an optiontree: every time a certain option is chosen, other routes becomebarred. Because of that choice, movement backwards to the pointbefore that choice was made is impossible. While Zionism as anoption was taken by many young Jews, it remained a minorityposition until the first days of the 3rd Reich. The ZionistFederation of Germany (ZVfD), an organisation representing a tinyminority of German Jews, was selected by the Nazis as the body torepresent the Jews of the Reich. Its was the only flag of aninterantional organisation allowed to fly in Berlin, and this wasthe only international organisation allowed to operate during thisperiod. From a marginal position, the leaders of the ZionistFederation were propelled to a prominence and centrality thatsurprised even them. All of a sudden they attained politicalpower, power based not on representation, but from being selectedas the choice of the Nazi regime for dealing with the the 'Jewishproblem'. Their position in negotiating with the Nazis agreementsthat affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the Jews inGermany transformed them from a utopian, marginal organisation inGermany (and some other countries in Europe) into a real option tobe considered by German Jews.The best example of this was the 'Transfer Agreement' of 1934.Immediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933, Jews all over theworld supported or were organising a world wide boycott of Germangoods. This campaign hurt the Nazi regime and the Germanauthorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott.It was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pullout, the campaign would collapse.This problem was solved by the ZVfD. A letter sent to the Naziparty as early as 21.  June 1933, outlined the degree of agreementthat existed between the two organisations on the question ofrace, nation, and the nature of the 'Jewish problem', and itoffered to collaborate with the new regime:"The realisation of Zionism could only be hurt by resentment ofJews abroad against the German development. Boycott propaganda -such as is currently being carried out against Germany in manyways - is in essence unZionist, because Zionism wants not to dobattle but to convince and build."In their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the newregime, the Zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott.The main public act was the signature of the "Transfer Agreement"with the Nazi authorities during the Zionist Congress of 1934. Inessence, the agreement was designed to get Germany's Jews out ofthe country and into Mandate Palestine. It provided a possibilityfor Jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of thecountry, through a transfer of German goods to Palestine. Thisright was denied to Jews leaving to any other destination. TheZionist organisation was the acting agent, through its financialorganisations. This agreement operated on a number of fronts -'helping' Jews to leave the country, breaking the ring of theboycott, exporting German goods in large quantities to Palestine,and last but not least, enabling the regime to be seen as humaneand reasonable even towards its avowed enemies, the Jews. Afterall, they argued, the Jews do not belong in Europe and now theJews come and agree with them.After news of the agreement broke, the boycott was doomed. If theZionist Organization found it possible and necessary to deal withthe Nazis, and import their goods, who could argue for a boycott ?This was not the first time that the interests of both movementswere presented to the German public as complementary. Baron VonMildenstein, the first head of the Jewish Department of the SS,later followed by Eichmann, was invited to travel to Palestine.This he did in early 1933, in the company of a Zionist leader,Kurt Tuchler. Having spent six months in Palestine, he wrote aseries of favourable articles in Der STURMER describing the 'newJew' of Zionism, a Jew Nazis could accept and understand.This little-known episode established quite clearly therelationship during the early days of Nazism, between the newregime and the ZVfD, a relationship that was echoed later in anumber of key instances, even after the nature of the FinalSolution became clear. In many cases this meant a silencing ofreports about the horrors of the exterminations. A bookconcentrating on this aspect of the Zionist reaction to theHolocaust is Post-Ugandan Zionism in the Crucible of theHolocaust, by S. B. Beth-Zvi.In the case of the Kastner episode, around which Jim Allen's playPERDITION is based, even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge ofthe real nature of events does not exist. It occured near the endof the war. The USSR had advanced almost up to Germany. Italy andthe African bases had been lost. The Nazis were on the run, with anumber of key countries, such as Rumania, leaving the Axis. Asecond front was a matter of months away, as the western Alliesprepared their forces. In the midst of all this we find Eichmann,the master bureaucrat of industrial murder, setting up his HZ inoccupied Budapest, after the German takeover of the country inApril 1944. His first act was to have a conference with the Jewishleadership, and to appoint Zionist Federation members, headed byKastner as the agent and clearing house for all Jews and theirrelationship with the SS and the Nazr authorities. Why they didthis is not difficult to see. As opposed to Poland, where itsthree and  a half million Jews lived in ghettoes and were visiblydifferent from the rest of the Polish population, the HungarianJews were an integrated part of the community. The middle classwas mainly Jewish, the Jews were mainly middle-class. They enjoyedfreedom of travel, served in the Hungarian (fascist) army infronline units, as officers and soldiers, their names wereHungarian - how was Eichmann to find them if they were to beexterminated ? The task was not easy, there were a million Jews inHungary, most of them resident, the rest being refugees from othercountries. Many had  heard about the fate of Jews elsewhere, andwere unlikely to believe any statements by Nazi officials.Like elsewhere, the only people who had the information and theear of the frightened Jewish population were the Judenrat. In thiscase the Judenrat comprsied mainly the Zionist Federation members.Without their help the SS, with 19 officers and less than 90 men,plus a few hundred Hungarian police, could not have collected andcontrolled a million Jews, when they did not even know theirwhereabouts. Kastner and the others were left under no illusions.Eichmann told Joel Brand, one of the members of Kastner'scommittee, that he intended to send all Hungary's Jews toAuschwitz, before he even started the expulsions!  He told themclearly that all these Jews will die, 12,000 a day, unless certainconditions were met.The Committee faced a simple choice - to tell the Jews of Hungaryabout their fate, (with neutral Rumania, where many could escape,being in most cases a few hours away) or to collaborate with theNazis by assisting in the concentration process. What would nothave been believed when coming from the SS, sounded quiteplausible when coming from the mouths of the Zionist leadership.Thus it is, that most of the Hungarian Jews went quietly to theirdeath, assured by their leadership that they were to be sent towork camps.To be sure, there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative ofdestruction: the trains of 'prominents' which Eichmann promised toKastner - a promise he kept to the last detail. For Eichmann itwas a bargain: allowing 1,680 Jews to survive, as the price paidfor the silent collaboration over the death of almost a millionJews.There was no way in which the Jews of Hungary could even belocated, not to say murdered, without the full collaboration ofKastner and his few friends. No doubt the SS would hunt a few Jewshere and there, but the scale of the operation would have beenminiscule compared to the half million who died in Auschwitz.It is important to realise that Kastner was not an aberration,like say Rumkovsky in Lodz. Kastner acted as a result of hisstrongly held Zionist convictions. His actions were a logicaloutcome of earlier positions. This is instanced when he exposed tothe Gestapo the existence of a British cell of saboteurs, Palgiand Senesh, and persuaded them to give themselves up, so as not todisrupt his operations. At no point during his trial or elsewhere,did Kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to thoseJews.To conclude, the role played by Zionists in this period, wasconnected to another role they could, and should have played, thatof alarming the whole world to what was happening in Europe. Theyhad the information, but politically it was contrary to theirpriorities. The priorities were, and still are, quite simple: Allthat furthers the Zionist enterprise in Palestine is followed,whatever the price. The lives of individuals, Jews and non-Jews,are secondary. If this process requires dealing with fascists,Nazis and other assorted dictatorial regimes across the world, sobe it.

Bosnian Muslims are slavic in ethnicity. They speak Serbo-Croatian. Butthere is a Christo-Slavic ideology whereby all true slavs are Christianand anyone who converted to Islam thereby must have changed ethnicity bychanging religion.  See the poems of Ngegos or the novels of Ivo Andricwho brilliantly displays these attitudes on the part of what he calls"the people" (i.e. Christian slavs).  For this reason, the war-criminalscall all the Bosnian Muslims "Turks" even though they are not ethnicallyTurk and do not speak Turkish as their first language.  For this reason,what is actually a genocide labeled against those who are ethnicallyidentical but religiously "other" is called, paradoxically, "ethniccleansing" rather than "religious cleansing."Thus, while a war rages between Serbs and Croats as a continuation ofWWII, and older agenda, the annihilation of Islam and Muslims fromBosnian, is being carried out under the cover of the Serbo-Croat war.Regards,Mike.>--Michael Sells, Department of Religion, Haverford CollegeHaverford, Pa 19041-1392

I wouldn't exactlycall it a state secret. The trial was simply tried behind closed doors. I hateto disappoint you but the United States has tried a number of espionage casesin camera.>> 5.      Is it true that Jews who reside in the occupied> territories are subject to different laws than non-Jews?>Not Jews. Israeli citizens. Jordanian law is in effect in the West Bank but theKNESSET passed a law that Israeli law would be binding on Israeli citizensresiding in the West Bank. These citizens could be Jews, Israeli Muslims, Druze,or Israeli Christians. It has NOTHING to do with religion.> 6.      Is it true that Jews who left Palestine in the war 1947/48> to avoid the war were automatically allowed to return, while their> Christian neighbors who did the same were not allowed to return ?Anyone who was registered (Jew, Muslim, Christian) could return. You might beconfusing this with the census taken in June 1967 on the West Bank after theSix Day War. In *this* instance, if the Arab was not physically present hecouldn't reside on the West Bank (e.g. if he had been visting Jordan).>> 7.      Is it true that Israel's Prime Minister, Y. Rabin, signed> an order for ethnical cleansing in 1948, as is done today in> Bosnia-Herzegovina ?>No. Not even if you drowned him in bourbon, scotch or brandy :-)> 8.      Is it true that Israeli Arab citizens are not admitted as> members in kibbutzim?Not true. Although a minority, there *are* some Israeli Arabs living onkibbutzim. On the other hand, at my age (42) I wouldn't be admitted to akibbutz nor could the family join me. Not that I would be so thrilled to do soin the first place. The kibbbutz movement places candidates under rigorousmembership criteria. Many Israeli Jews are not admitted.>> 9.      Is it true that Israeli law attempts to discourage> marriages between Jews and non-Jews ?The religious status quo in Israel has marriage and divorce  handled by thereligious courts. The RABBANUT handles marriage and divorce for Jews, theMuslim SHAARIA  courts are for Muslims, the Christian denominations have theirreligious courts, and the Druze have their own courts. The entire religiousestablishment (Jewish, Muslim, Druze, Christian) wants to keep it that way.>> 10.     Is it true that Hotel Hilton in Tel Aviv is built on the> site of a muslim cemetery ?I believe it's adjacent to a former Muslim cemetary. From what I heard (and I'dlike to get feedback from Muslins  on the net) sanctity of cemetaries is notheld that sancrosanct as it is held by Jews. The current Israeli Ministry ofTrade and Industry on Agron Road in Jerusalem is housed in a former hotel thatwas built by Arabs in the 1920's on the site of an Arab cemetary.Joshbackon@VMS.HUJI.AC.IL>> Thanks,>> Elias Davidsson Iceland email:   elias@ismennt.is

Iagree that Arab news sources are also inherently biased. But Ibelieve the statement I was reacting to was that since theamerican accounts of events are not fully like the Israeliaccounts, the Americans are biased. I just thought that theIsraelis had more motivation for bias.The UN has tried many times to condemn Israel for itsgross violation of human rights. However the US has vetoed mostsuch attempts. It is interesting to note that the U.S. is oftenthe only country opposing such condemnation (well the U.S. andIsrael). It is also interesting to note that that meansother western countries realize these human rights violations.So maybe there are human rights violations going on after all.

Pray let us not be infantile arbiters for past injustice.Are you suggesting that we should forget the cold-blooded genocide of2.5 million Muslim people by the Armenians between 1914 and 1920? But most people aren't aware that in 1939 Hitler said that he would patternhis elimination of the Jews based upon what the Armenians did to Turkishpeople in 1914.     'After all, who remembers today the extermination of the Tartars?'      (Adolf Hitler, August 22, 1939: Ruth W. Rosenbaum (Durusoy),           "The Turkish Holocaust - Turk Soykirimi", p. 213.)I refer to the Turks and Kurds as history's forgotten people. It doesnot serve our society well when most people are totally unaware ofwhat happened in 1914 where a vicious society, run by fascist Armenians,decided to simply use the phoniest of pretexts as an excuse, for wiping out a peace-loving, industrious, and very intelligent and productive ethnic group. What we have is a demand from the fascist government ofx-Soviet Armenia to redress the wrongs that were done against ourpeople. And the only way we can do that is if we can catch hold of and not lose sight of the historical precedence in this very century. We cannot reverse the events of the past, but we can and we must strive to keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic, so asto help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because of their religion or their race. Which means that I support the claims of the Turks and Kurds to return to their lands in x-Soviet Armenia, to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

And though the number of books allowed on the trip varied from 10 to 30, depending on the type of spacecraft and the generosity of the interviewer, and celebrities are people of the most varied tastes, ages, and professions, not one of them dared to say that he or she would want to take with them atleast one book of arithmetic problems.Some of these people certainly excluded this kind of literature because they were trained in the humanities and had nothing but scorn for "numbers" (though secretly afraid of them). Others steered clear of such puzzle books because they were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern mathematics and didn't mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn't know how to solve mere arithmetic problems. Professional mathematicians were no exception. Here's what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin, a specialist in statistics, wrote about arithmetic: "I willingly confess that any time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem, it wasa hard work for me, and sometimes I failed completely. Of course, like most of my friends, I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route--constructing equations or sets of equations. But we were supposed to avoid using algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . By the way, it's a fact that is well known and oft repeated that, as a rule, neither high school graduates, nor students at teaching colleges, nor teachers beginning their careers(nor, I must add, scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. It seems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade teachers."Now, I'm not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the bookbag of anyone flying into space. But a sense of justice induces me to recommend one particular problem book, one that will satisfy the most fastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a relatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyage--say, toVenus and back.One for the "road"They both took out the books they brought for the road. Kingsley glanced at the Royal Astronomer's book and saw a bright cover with a group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers. "God knows what this kind of stuff leads to," thought Kingsley.The Royal Astronomer looked at Kingsley's book and saw the History of Herodotus. "Good Lord, next he'll be reading Thucydides," thought the Royal Astronomer.--Fred Hoyle, The Black CloudThe book I'm talking about isn't very big, but its 24 problems constitute 24 elegant miniatures from seventh-century Armenia. Naive and wise at the sametime, rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period, these problems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of Armenian architecture, the church on the island of Akhtamar in Lake Van (in what is now Turkey_. They are as inseparable from the image of Armenia as the elegant letters of the Armenian alphabet, invented by Mesrop Mashtots, or the songs of Komitas, or the paintings of Saryan.An edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a bibliographic rarity. It was published under the title Problems and Solutionsof Vardapet [1] Anania of Shirak, Armenian Mathematician of the Seventh Century (translated and published by I. A. Orbeli, Petrograd, 1918).The abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way of life and customs of that remote epoch when Anania of Shirak lived and worked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book. For many years the book was known only to researchers in the humanities--specialists in Armenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn't let justanyone see it. Even now, after research by K. P. Patkanov, the learned monk Father Kaloust, J.I. Orbeli, A. Abramyan, V. K. Chaloyan, and others has brought the works of Anania of Shirak to light in scholarly circles, the general reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable problem book.Vardapet Anania of ShirakOnce fell in love with the art of calculation, I thought that no philosophical notion can be constructed without number, considering it the mother of all wisdom.--Anania of ShirakAmong ancient Armenian thinkers, Vardapet Anania of Shirak stands out because of the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his work. Some of his works have been preserved. In addition to the Problems andSolutions, the following tracts have found a special place in the estimationof scholars: On Weights and Measures, Cosmography and Calendrical Theory, andArmenian Geography of the Seventh Century A.D. (the authorship of the lastwork was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient Armenia, Movses of Khoren).In his autobiography, Anania of Shirak has this to say about himself:I, Anania of Shirak, having studied all the science of ourArmenian land and having learned the Holy Scripture intimately, in the expression of the psalmist, "every day I illuminated the eyes of my mind." Feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation,I came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy, the mother of all sciences, without number. I could find in Armenia neither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the sciences. I therefore went to Greece and met in Theodosiople a man named Iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works. He told methat in Forth Armenia [2] there lived a famous mathematician,Christosatur. I went this person and spent six months with him. But         soon I noticed that Christosatur was a master not of all science but         only of certain fragmentary facts.I then went to Constantinople, where I met acquaintances who told me: "Why did you go so far, when much closer to us, in Trebizon, on the coast of Pontus [3] lives the Byzantine vardapet Tyukhik. He is full of wisdom, is known to kings, and knows Armenian literature." I asked them how they knew this. They answered: "We saw ourselves that many people traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man. Indeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of Constantinople,Philagrus, traveled with us, bringing many young persons to become pupils of Tyukhik." When I heard this, I expressed my gratitude to God, who had quenched the thirst of His slave.I went to Tyukhik at the monastery of St. Eugene and explained why I had come. He received me graciously and said: "I praise Our Lord that He sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of St. Gregory; I am glad that all your country will learn from me. I myself lived in Armenia for many years as a youth. Ignorance reigned there." Vardapet Tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with me. The Lord bestowed upon me His blessing: I completely assimilated the science of number, and with such success that my fellow studentsat the king's court began to envy me.I spent eight years with Tyukhik and studied many books that had not been translated into our language. For the vardapet had an innumerable collection of books: secret and explicit, ecclesiastical and pagan, books on art, history, and medicine, books of chronologies. Why enumerate them by title? In a word, there is no book that Tyukhik did not have. And he had such a gift from the Holy Spirit for translatingthat when he sat down to translate something from the Greek into Armenian, he did not struggle as other translators did, and the translation read as if the work were written in that language originally.Tyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had learned the Armenian language. "When I was young," he said, "I lived in Trebizon, at the court of the military chief Ioannus Patricus, and for a long time, up to the accession of Mauritius to the throne I served as a military man in Armenia and learned your language and literature. During one attack by Persian troops on the Greeks, I was wounded and escaped to Antioch. I lost all my possessions. Praying to the Lord to heal my wounds, I made a promise: "If You prolong my life, I shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to collecting treasures of knowledge." And the Lord heard my prayers. After I recovered I went to Jerusalem, and from there to Alexandria and Rome. Upon returning to Constantinople, I met a famous philosopher from Athens and studied with him for many years. After that I returned to my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people."After some years that philosopher died. Not finding a replacement for him, the king and his courtiers sent for Tyukhik and invited him to assume the teacher's position. Tyukhik, citing the promise he made to God not to move far from the city, turned down the offer. But becauseof his wide leaning, people came streaming from all countries to study with him.And I, the most insignificant of all Armenians, having learned from him this powerful science, desired by kings, brought it to our country, supported by no one, obligated only to my own industry, God's help, and the prayers of the Blessed Educator. And no one thanked me for my efforts.Problems and SolutionsA half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printedon verge'; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth--on rag paper; one forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth--on vellum, and forty-five inscribed copies--on Dutch paper. And so, find how many copies were printed in all.--Imitation of Anania of ShirakA Latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli ("books have their own fate").The fate of Problems and Solutions by Anania of Shirak is quite amazing. Themanuscripts of Anania's book were preserved only because, according to Armenian historians, "in ancient and medieval Armenia manuscripts were guarded from invaders, like weapons, and cherished, like one's own children." Bidingtheir time, the manuscripts lay in the Matenadaran, a renowned depository of ancient manuscripts (now the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts).And its hour finally arrived. In 1896 the learned monk Father Kaloust used two manuscripts to publish the problem book, supplementing it with an introduction and commentary. In 1918 the book was translated into Russian, edited, annotated, and typeset by Iosef Orbeli, a prominent scholar (and later a member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR).In the translator's words, the problems of Anania are "amusing, full of life, and simple." Orbeli goes on to say: "The subjects of the problems are generally taken from everyday life. The scene is predominantly his homeland Shirak and the surrounding countryside, and the dramatis personae, if they are named, are the local princes--the Kamsarakans, including Nersekh, who was a contemporary of Anania." Like other ancient authors, Anania of Shirak used only "aliquots" -- that is, fractions with a numerator of 1. When it isnecessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1, one has to represent it as a sum of aliquots (see the epigraph above).Like any true work of art, the problems of Anania suffer terribly in the retelling. You have to read the originals (albeit in translation) in their full glory. So let's open Anania's problem book--a gift from across the ages.Problems 1 and 8 relate to the Armenian uprising against the Persians in A.D. 572.Problem 1My father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the Armenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary heroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops. The first time, he struck down half of the Persian army. The second time, pursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. The third time, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. The Persians who were still alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to Nakhichevan. And so, from this remainder, find how many Persian soldiers there were before the massacre.Problem 8During the famous Armenian uprising against the Persians, when ZaurakKamsarakan killed Suren, one of the Armenian azats[4] sent an envoy to thePersian king to report the baleful news. The envoy covered fifty miles in a day. Fifteen days later, when he learned of this, Zaurak Kamsarakan sent riders in pursuit to bring the envoy back. The riders covered eighty miles in a day. And so, find how many days it took them to catch the envoy.Problem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal. In the Russian translation, they are all called "dishes." But in the original Armenian, according to Orbeli's note, the dishes in the first and second instances are called mesur, and in the third instance scutel. Scutel is a common Armenian word, but mesur had not been encountered in Armenian literature before Anania's Problems and Solutions.Problem 18There was a tray in my house. I melted it down and made other vessels from the metal. From one third I made a mesur; from one fourth, another mesur; fromone fifth, two goblets; from one sixth, two scutels; and from two hundred ten drams, I made a bowl. And now, find the weight of the tray.Several of the problems reflect the richness of the Caucasian fauna in Anania's time -- for instance, problem 7.Problem 7Once I was in Marmet, the capital of the Kamsarakans. Strolling along the bank of the river Akhuryan, I saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast. We caught a half and a quarter of the school, and all the fishes that slippedout of the net ended up in a creel. When I looked in the creel, I found forty-five fishes. And now, find how many fishes here were in all.The temptation is great to present all 24 problems. But I'll restrain myselfand offer you just one more.Problem 20 provides some interesting information about the wild animals that inhabited Armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is nomention of them even in zoological reference books. The wild donkey, according to the generally accepted view, never roamed the Armenian lands. Yet Anania of Shirak offers evidence to the contrary .Problem 20The hunting preserve of Nersekh Kamsarakan, ter[5] of Shirak and Asharunik, was at the base of the mountain called Artin. One night great herds of wilddonkey entered the preserve. The hunters could not cope with the donkeys and, running to the village of Talin, told Nersekh about them. When he arrived withhis brothers and azats and entered the preserve, they began killing the wild beasts. Half of the animals were caught in traps, one fourth were killed by arrows. The young, which constituted one twelfth of all the animals, were caught alive, and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears. And so, find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre."Set in type by me, Iosef Orbeli"His biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a bibliography.-- K Uzbashyan, AcademicianIosef Abgarovich OrbeliAnyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy (1/n of the small printing--n is the solution to the epigraph in the previous section) of the Russian translation of Anania of Shirak's Problems and Solutions, a thin book with yellowed pages,has probably noticed the variety of the fonts, the elegance of the borders, and the high quality of the design, printing, and binding. Such great attention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for a degree in bookmaking. And this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma attesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it. An advertisement at the end of the book reads: "This book was typeset in December 1917 at the printing offices of the Russian Academy of Sciences by me, Iosef Orbeli; the text was also proofread, laid out, and decorated with borders by me. Various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project to the end; the final pages of the book were typeset by M. Strolman."Typesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned orientalist Iosef Orbeli, who later became the director of the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad. He was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith. Orbeli had already become acquainted with the famous academic printing house Typis Academiae, founded in 1728 and known all over the scientific world for its rich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters. In preparing to publish the corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of Armenian churches, Orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve the unique signs and ligatures. This complicated work was done by M. G.Strolman. (Unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the blockade of Leningrad in World War II.)When Orbeli came to the printing offices of the Academy of Sciences, times were hard. The only way to publish the newly translated Problems of Ananiawas for Orbeli to learn typesetting (he had always been attracted to the printer's craft). In 1922 Orbeli became the director of printing at the Academy of Sciences. Even after he retired, he remained a tireless championof Russian academic typography.Back to EarthThis book by definition does not exhaust all the most important works in this domain. The editor hopes that those who are guilty of this incompleteness will read these lines and, stung by shame, will work up, if not a collection like this, at least a monograph.--V. Bonch-Bruyevich introduction to theRussian translation of Solid-BodySymmetry by R. Knox and A. GoldLet's imagine a time when space flight is an everyday thing, and high schoolers will spend their breaks as astronauts-in training in the Perelman crater on the far side of the Moon. Maybe one of the space travelers will take this very copy of Quantum, and another, looking over her shoulder, will read this article and say to himself: "This Anania from Shirak seems like a pretty interesting guy. When I get home I'll try to find his problems."Good luck, my young friend! Anania is sure to entertain you. Perhaps by thenthere will be more than n copies of his timeless Problems and Solutions. And we can hope they will be as lovingly printed as the masterpieces created by Iosef Orbeli.[1] Vardapet (or vartabed) means teacher or learned man in Armenian. (The    Armenian language suffers in English from a dual transliteration scheme.    Thus, Mesrop is often rendered as "Mesrob", Komitas as "Gomidas," and so     on).[2] Fourth Armenia was one of fifteen provinces into which, according to    Armenian Geography in the Seventh Century A.D., so-called Great Armenia    was divided.[3] "Pontus" (or "Pontus Euxinus") was an old name for the Black Sea.[4] "Azats" were members one of several strata of freemen in ancient Armenia.[5] "Ter" was the title of the heads of sovereign royal families in ancient      Armenia.-- David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | "How do we explain Turkish troops onS.D.P.A.

All that changes is the phrasing; complaining >that I used the wrong word is a quibble.Well, your Armenian grandparents were fascist. As early as 1934, K. S. Papazian asserted in 'Patriotism Perverted' that the Armenians        'lean toward Fascism and Hitlerism.'[1]At that time, he could not have foreseen that the Armenians wouldactively assume a pro-German stance and even collaborate in WorldWar II. His book was dealing with the Armenian genocide of Turkishpopulation of eastern Anatolia. However, extreme rightwing ideologicaltendencies could be observed within the Dashnagtzoutune long beforethe outbreak of the Second World War.In 1936, for example, O. Zarmooni of the 'Tzeghagrons' was quotedin the 'Hairenik Weekly:' "The race is force: it is treasure. If we follow history we shall  see that races, due to their innate force, have created the nations and these have been secure only insofar as they have reverted to the race after becoming a nation. Today Germany and Italy are strong because as nations they live and breath in terms of race. On the other hand, Russia is comparatively weak because she is bereft of social sanctities."[2][1] K. S. Papazian, 'Patriotism Perverted,' (Boston, Baikar Press   1934), Preface.[2] 'Hairenik Weekly,' Friday, April 10, 1936, 'The Race is our   Refuge' by O. Zarmooni.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists                             a single Turkish soul.' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)

The Contracting Parties confirm that genocide, whethercommitted in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish.Article 2. In the present Convention genocide means any of thefollowing acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole orin part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:A) Killing member of the group;B) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;C) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life    calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole    or in part;D) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;E) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group;Article 3. The following acts shall be punishable:a) Genocideb) Conspiracy to commit genocidec) Direct and public incitement to commit genocided) Attempt to commit genocide.Article 4. Persons committing genocide or any of the other actsenumerated in Article 3 shall be punished, whether they areconstitutionally responsible rulers, public officials or privateindividuals.Had the Convention on Genocide existed before the Armenian massacres of the Turks and Kurds, it would probably have been difficult for the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its responsiblesto start murdering of civilian, defenseless, faithful Ottomancitizens, children and women, (GENOCIDE AND ATTEMPT TO GENOCIDE),to make plans to exterminate, as they have done also to Urartusand Jews, faithful Ottoman citizens (CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT GENOCIDE), to incite Armenians to armed revolt against the legal authorityand to commit Genocide, (DIRECT AND PUBLIC INCITEMENT TO COMMITGENOCIDE).Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

Deir Yassin was an unprovoked attack onthe part of the Jews, and a massacre defines it best in myopinion.  The village of Deir Yassin had had a pact with theJews, a peace pact, but the Irgun purposely broke thisagreement in order to scare off the Palestinians.  I mightgrant that this village housed armed Arabs [I doubt it] butnothing in the archives and available literature indicates thatthis was a motivating force amongst the Irgun.  The Deir YassinMASSACRE was part of an over all strategy to intimidate thePalestinians to flee the Jewish Homeland.,...and contrary toyour belief, many civilians were killed.  Deir Yassin was lateradvertized by the very Jews who perpetrated it because it wasuseful in getting many Palestinians to leave.  The Palestinianswere rightfully scared off, because they did not want anotherDeir Yassin.  I'm not necessarily condemning the Israelites here;atrocities were aslo committed on the part of the Arabs.Israelophiles should just be careful in thinking that they areand were the good guys in the middle east.  Both Arab and Jewsuck equally.

In fact no one was killed in any war at any time or any place.   People die that is all. No one gets killed.   Maybe also vietamiese didn't die in Vietnam war killed by american   napalm they were just pyromaniacs and that's all.

Well it is as stupid as what you said .Next time you want to lie do it   intelligently.   Sincerely yours.   HassanArab civilians did die at Dir yassin. But there was no massacre. Firstof all, the village housed many *armed* troops. Secondly, the Irgunand Stern fighters had absolutely no intentions of killing civilians.The village was attacked only for its military significance. In fact,a warning was given to the occupants of the village to leave beforethe attack was to begin.By all rational standards, Dir Yassin was not a massacre. The killingwas unintentional. The village housed Arab snipers and Arab troops.Thus it was attacked for its military significance. It was notattacked with intentions of killing any civilians.To even compare Dir Yassin, in which some 120 or so Arabs died, to theHolocaust is absurd. The Irgun did not want to kill any civilians. Thevillage had almost 1000 inhabitants, most of whom survived.Harry.

Greeks,Armenians,Kurds(I must say Turk-Kurd relations are improving slightly with time) and not pose a threat to Turkey's neighbours.The Turks blatantly rejected this treaty(the Germans grudgingly accepted Versailles which was a million times worse for the health and pride of the German people).The Greeks who had an army there,were there with BRITISHand FRENCH backing to enforce Sevres.    In possibly the first example of appeasement the Young Turk governmentmanaged screwed the Treaty of Laussane out of the weak allies,this was after the Greek forces were were destroyed at Smyrna.When this occurred incidently,FRENCH warships were in the harbour and many Greeks trying escape swam to the FRENCH warships and climbed aboard only to get their arms cut off by the FRENCHas they clawed they're way up the sides of the ships.Libertae,egalitae,fraternatae.>> >> There were a couple millions of Greeks living in Asia Minor until 1923.>> Someone had to protect them.

Thedistinction is not trivial. Murder happens to innocent people, not peoplewhose line of work is to kill or be killed. It just so happened that thesesoldiers, in the line of duty, were killed by the opposition. Andresistance is different from terrorism. Certainly the athletes in Munichwere victims of terrorists (though some might call them freedom fighters).Their deaths cannot be compared to those of soldiers who are killed byresistance fighters. Don't forget that it was the French Resistance to theNazi occupying forces which eventually succeeded in driving out thehostile occupiers in WWII. Diplomacy has not worked with Israel and theLebanese people are tired of being occupied! They are now turning to theonly option they see as viable.

Polymenakos) writes:> Well, ZUMABOT claims just the opposite: That Greeks are not allowing>Turks to exit the country. Now, explain this: The number of Turks in>Thrace has steadily risen from 50,000 in 23 to 80,000, while the Greeks ofDr. Goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally be believed. I have been observing that 'Poly' has been practicing Goebels' rule quite loyally. 'Poly's audience is mostly made of Greeks who are not allowed to listen to Turkish news. However, in today's informed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves. For instance, those who lived in 1974 will remember the TV news they watched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can read the American newspapers of July and August 1974 to find out what really happened. There are in Turkiye the Greek Hospital, The Greek Girls' Lycee Alumni Association, the Principo Islands Greek Benevolent Society, the Greek Medical Foundation, the Principo Greek Orphanage Foundation, the Yovakimion Greek Girls' Lycee Foundation, and the Fener Greek Men's Lycee Foundation.  As for Greece, the longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish' in titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts have ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association, the Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti Turkish Association on grounds that there are no Turksin Western Thrace. Such community associations had been active until 1984. But they were first told to removethe word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their officialpapers and then eventually close down. This is also the final verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.In the city of Komotini, a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkishparentage, was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonmentwith no right to appeal, just for saying outloud that he wasof Turkish descent. This duly-elected ethnic Turkish officialwas also deprived of his political rights for a period of three years. Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than a vehicle, used by the Greek governments, to cover-up their inferiority complex they display, vis-a-vis, the people of Turkiye. The Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,' which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference to 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the existence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the essential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger Turkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the three nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of themselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized according to the agreements? Poor 'Poly.'It also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece and the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.The Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkishminority. They pursue the same denial in connection with the Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition,in 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091,virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar andother charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supportingreligious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek governments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespectiveof the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Althoughthe Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters inGreece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electingits religious leaders. Talk about democracy.The government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic convention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called' Greek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection of historical monuments. The government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward Hellenizing the region.And you pondered. Sidiropoulos, the president of the Macedonian Human Rights Committee, became the latest victim of a tactic long used by the Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation of the Macedonian minority. A forestry official by occupation, Sidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of Kefalonia, hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina. His employer, the Florina City Council, asked him to depart in 24 hours. The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his involvement in Copenhagen. He returned to Florina by his own choice and remains without a job. Helsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating the plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their findings were published in a report titled  'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.'The report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the Turkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance, the Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the Lausanne Convention. The Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlikwere attacked, and tombstones were broken. The cemetery inKarotas was razed by bulldozers.Shall I go on? Why not? The people of Turkiye are not going to take human rights lessons from the Greek Government. The discussion of human rights violations in Greece does not stop at the Greek frontier. In several following articles I shall dwell on and expose the Greek treatment of Turksin Western Thrace and the Aegean Macedonians.It has been reported that the Greek Cypriot administration has an intense desire for arms and that Greece has made plans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it has to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on conventional arms reductions in Europe. Meanwhile, Greek and Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned to take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the transfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern Cyprus, a process that will conflict with the spirit of the agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe.An acceptable method may certainly be found when thereis a will. But we know of various kinds of violentbehaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burningof buildings. The rugs at the Amfia village mosque were dragged out to the front of the building and burnt there. Shots were fired on the mosque in the village of Aryana.Now wait, there is more.  'Greek Atrocities in the Vilayet of Smyrna (May to July 1919), Inedited  Documents and Evidence of English and French Officers,' Published by  The Permanent Bureau of the Turkish Congress at Lausanne, Lausanne,  Imprimerie Petter, Giesser & Held, Caroline, 5 (1919).  pages 82-83:<< 1. The train going from Denizli to Smyrna was stopped at Ephesus   and the 90 Turkish travellers, men and women who were in it ordered   to descend. And there in the open street, under the eyes of their   husbands, fathers and brothers, the women without distinction of age   were violated, and then all the travellers were massacred. Amongst   the latter the Lieutenant Salih Effendi, a native of Tripoli, and a   captain whose name is not known, and to whom the Hellenic authorities   had given safe conduct, were killed with specially atrocious tortures.   2. Before the battle, the wife of the lawyer Enver Bey coming from   her garden was maltreated by Greek soldiers, she was even stript   of her garments and her servant Assie was violated.   3. The two tax gatherers Mustapha and Ali Effendi were killed in the   following manner: Their arms were bound behind their backs with wire   and their heads were battered and burst open with blows from the butt   end of a gun.   4. During the firing of the town, eleven children, six little girls   and five boys, fleeing from the flames, were stopped by Greek soldiers   in the Ramazan Pacha quarter, and thrown into a burning Jewish house   near bridge, where they were burnt alive. This fact is confirmed on oath   by the retired commandant Hussein Hussni Effendi who saw it.   5. The clock-maker Ahmed Effendi and his son Sadi were arrested and   dragged out of their shop. The son had his eyes put out and was then   killed in the court of the Greek Church, but Ahmed Effendi has been   no more heard of.   6. At the market, during the fire, two unknown people were wounded   by bayonets, then bound together, thrown into the fire and burnt alive.   The Greeks killed also many Jews. These are the names of some:  Moussa Malki, shoemaker          killed  Bohor Levy, tailor               killed  Bohor Israel, cobbler            killed  Isaac Calvo, shoemaker           killed  David Aroguete                   killed  Moussa Lerosse                   killed  Gioia Katan                      killed  Meryem Malki                     killed  Soultan Gharib                   killed  Isaac Sabah                      wounded  Moche Fahmi                      wounded  David Sabah                      wounded  Moise Bensignor                  killed  Sarah Bendi                      killed  Jacob Jaffe                      wounded  Aslan Halegna                    wounded....>>Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

Joseph Biden, D-Del., told Christopher at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  ``Preventive diplomacy is not in your capability right now in Bosnia- Herzegovina. Biden chastised the administration and its Republican predecessor for what he characterized as a limp response to the Serbian policy of  ``ethnic cleansing'' of Muslims, including rape and shelling of civilians. ``The time has come for us and the world to stop bemoaning the fact that all the options are bad ones,'' Biden said. ``They are all bad ones and we ought to pick a couple.'' Biden also endorsed lifting an international arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia so the Muslim-dominated Bosnian government might have a chance to at least defend itself against the Serbs. Christopher said this could give an opening role in the conflict to                     **************************************************** the radical Islamic government of Iran.***************************************O, I C!   Biden endorsed bombing Serbian heavy weapons around the besieged  eastern town of Srebrenica.  ``There's not a military person...who will not tell you that they  could today, if you gave them the order, take out the heavy weaponry  around Srebrenica,'' Biden said.  ``If you did nothing else, nothing else but that, you would have  saved hundreds of women and children who are being absolutely massacred  right now.''  Military action ``is the only thing that's going to change the  equation,'' Biden said.....................................  Despite the frustrations and pressure, Christopher had no enthusiasm  for American combat aircraft to strike Serb positions in Bosnia-  Herzegovina.....................>``Clearly we are at a turning point in the Bosnia situation,''>Christopher said. ``Air strikes are among those steps that are so>complex because they tend to interfere with the humanitarian endeavours.>I think there may be better options.''Humanitarian as in feeding them and let them get raped and killed.>political conflict.

He added: "What we are facing is pureGreek hatred and racial discrimination."Spelling out the demands of the Turkish ethnic community in Greecehe said "We want the restoration of Greek citizenship of 544 ethnicTurks. Their citizenship was revoked by using the excuse that thispeople have stayed out of Greece for too long. They are Greek citizensand are residing in Greece, even one of them is actively serving inthe Greek army. Besides, other non-Turkish citizens of Greece arenot subject to this kind of interpretation at an extent that many ofGreek-Americans have Greek citizenship and they permanently live inthe United States.""We want guarantee for Turkish minority's equal rights. We want Greekgovernment to accept the Turkish minority and grant us our civil rights.Our people are waiting since 25 years to get driving licenses. The Greekgovernment is not granting building permits to Turks for renovatingour buildings or building new ones. If your name is Turkish, you arenot hired to the government offices.""Furthermore, we want Greek government to give us equal opportunityin business. They do not grant licenses so we can participate in theeconomic life of Greece. In my case, they denied me a medical licensenecessary for practicing surgery in Greek hospitals despite the factthat I have finished a Greek medical school and followed all thenecessary steps in my career.""We want freedom of expression for ethnic Turks. We are not allowedto call ourselves Turks. I myself have been subject of a number oflaw suits and even have been imprisoned just because I called myselfa Turk.""We also want Greek government to provide freedom of religion."In separate interview with The Turkish Times, Dr. Sadik Ahmet statedthat the conditions of ethnic Turks are deplorable and in the eyes ofGreek laws, ethnic Greeks are more equal than ethnic Turks. As an example,he said there are about 20,000 telephone subscribers in Selanik (Thessaloniki)and only about 800 of them are Turks. That is not because Turks do notwant to have telephone services at their home and businesses. He saidthat Greek government changed the election law just to keep him outof the parliament as an independent representative and they statedthis fact openly to him. While there is no minimum qualificationrequirement for parties in terms of receiving at least 3% of the votes,they imposed this requirement for the independent parties, includingthe Turkish candidates.Ahmet was born in a small village at Gumulcine (Komotini), Greece 1947.He earned his medical degree at University of Thessaloniki in 1974.he served in the Greek military as an infantryman.In 1985 he got involved with community affairs for the first timeby collecting 15,000 signatures to protest the unjust implementationof laws against ethnic Turks.

In April 1942, Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus. A number of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to Germanofficials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren BegzadianPaikhar, son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku.Paikhar wrote a letter to Hitler, asking for German support to hisArmenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting thecreation of an Armenian SS formation in order "to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the  spirit of the Nazi ideas."He wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territoriesof the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkishhomeland. Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in GoebbelsPropaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian- and French-languageradio broadcastings.[1] The Armenian-language broadcastings wereproduced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth.[2][1] Patrick von zur Muhlen (Muehlen), p. 106.[2] Enno Meyer, A. J. Berkian, 'Zwischen Rhein und Arax, 900    Jahre Deutsch-Armenische beziehungen,' (Heinz Holzberg    Verlag-Oldenburg 1988), pp. 124 and 129.The establishment of Armenian units in the German army was favoredby General Dro (the Butcher). He played an important role in theestablishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any official position. His views were represented by his men in therespective organs. An interesting meeting took place between Droand Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942.Dro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and aftera long conversation, asked if he could visit POW camp close toBerlin. Himmler provided Dro with his private car.[1] A minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy.As such, they were subject to German racism. However, Armenianswere the least threatened and indeed most privileged.

Richard Hirschhaut, director of the San Francisco branch of the ADL, art dealer Roy Bullock and former policeman Tom Gerard were also named as defendants in the suit, filed in San Francisco County Superior Court.      The 19 accuse the ADL of B'nai B'rith, a group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, and the other defendants of secretly gathering information on them, including data from state and federal agencies.      The suit alleges they disclosed the information to others, including the governments of Israel and South Africa, in what it alleges was a ``a massive spying operation.''      The action is a class-action suit. It was filed on behalf of about 12,000 anti-apartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom the plaintiffs believe the ADL, Bullock and Gerard gathered information.      Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately  available for comment on Wednesday.      The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that Gerard, a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit, passed confidential police files on California political activists to a spy ring.      The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL, Bullock and Gerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL's offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles.      The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California, which prohibits the publication of information obtained from official  sources.  It seeks exemplary damages of at least $2,500 per person as well as  other unspecified damages.      Lawyer Pete McCloskey, a former Congresmen who is representing the plaintiffs, said the 19 plaintiffs included Arab-Americans and Jews -- and  his wife Helen, who also had information gathered about her.      One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens, a research scientist at the University of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli Defence Minister.      Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept on him in the 1980s, presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of Palestinians and his position on the Israeli-occupied territories.      According to court documents released last week, Bullock and Gerard both kept information on thousands of California political activists.      In the documents, a police investigator said he believed the ADL paid Bullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and Bullock received confidential information from the authorities.      No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case. The ADL, Bullock and Gerard have all denied any wrongdoing.  ...........  js

Maybe I'll go rent Midnight Express tonight.  I haven't seen that >scene in awhile; I have to savor the moment all over again.Well, does it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920, the fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion and national origin?As in the past in Turkiye, and today in Azerbaijan, for utopic and idiotic causes the Armenians brought havoc to their neighbors. A short-sighted and misplaced nationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda and anachronistic methods the Armenians continue to become pernicious for the region. As usual, they will be treated accordingly by their neighbors. Nagorno-Karabag is a mountainous enclave that lies completely within Azerbaijan with no border or history whatsoever connected to x-Soviet Armenia. Besides the geographical aspect, Nagorno-Karabag is the historic homeland and the 'cradle' of the artistic and literary heritage of Azerbaijan, which renders the Armenian claims preposterous, even lunatic. And we still demand:1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish andKurdish people;3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for theirheinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;4. that all world governments officially recognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian political pressure.The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in theefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Now what would you do? Source: 'The Sunday Times,' 1 March 1992 (a British Weekly, written by         Thomas Goltz, from Agdam, Azerbaijan.)    ARMENIAN SOLDIERS MASSACRE HUNDREDS OF FLEEING FAMILIES.    The spiralling  violence gripping the  outer republics of  the formerSoviet Union gained new impetus  yesterday with cold-blooded slaughter ofhundreds of women and children in war-racked Nagorno-Karabakh.    Survivors  reported that  Armenian soldiers  shot and  bayoneted morethan 450  Azeris, many of  them women and  children, who were  fleeing anattack  on their  town. Hundreds,  possibly thousands,  were missing  andfeared dead.    The attackers  killed most of  the soldiers and  volunteers defendingthe women  and children.  They then  turned their  guns on  the terrifiedrefugees. The few  survivors later described what  happened:" That's whenthe real  slaughter began," said  Azer Hajiev,  one of three  soldiers tosurvive. "The  Armenians just shot and  shot. And then they  came in andstarted carving up people with their bayonets and knives."    " They were shooting, shooting, shooting", echoed Rasia Aslanova, whoarrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way throughArmenian lines. She said her husband, Kayun, and a son-in-law were killedin front of her. Her daughter was still missing.    One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off.    The survivors  said 2000  others, some of  whom had  fled separately,were still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from theirwounds or the cold.    By late  yesterday, 479 deaths had  been registered at the  morgue inAgdam's morgue,  and 29 bodies  had been buried  in the cemetery.  Of theseven corpses  I saw awaiting  burial, two  were children and  three werewomen, one shot through the chest at point blank range.    Agdam hospital was  a scene of carnage and terror.  Doctors said theyhad 140 patients who escaped slaughter, most with bullet injuries or deepstab wounds.    Nor were they safe in Agdam. On friday night rockets fell on the citywhich  has a  population  of 150,000,  destroying  several buildings  andkilling one person.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

If Irgun had to attack civiliantargets to terrorize in order that they might obtain someobjective, I'm sure they would have done so.  I also don'texclude Irgun's action against British soldiers as terrorism.The British were showing signs of favoring a compromise withregards to Palestine, and the Irgun and branch off groups madea point to kill young British recruits so that mothers andfathers back in Britain would get angry at Britains continuedpresence in Palestine.  Sounds like a form of terrorism to me,and not much removed from Arab terrorism.  We must not alsoforget that Irgun, or Irgun branch off groups [more likely]killed many jews who were not as hardline zionist as they, orwho cooperated with the British.  I'll reiterate again.... both sides are screwy, butI'll favor the underdog in this case because I do think theywere a bit screwed.

They issued a statement after a three-day Gulf Cooperation Councilsummit saying Iran had to show proof of its good neighbourly intentions by rescindingmeasures that "rocked Gulf stability and security."     The leaders avoided the anti-Iranian rhetoric of recent statementsby Egypt, which engineered a last minute settlement of a border row between Saudi Arabiaand Qatar that allowed all members to attend the summit.     Egypt said its fears about Iranian intentions in the region andTehran's alleged encouragement of Moslem fundamentalist unrest were largely behindPresident Hosni Mubarak's mediation.     The GCC statement stressed that developing relations between theGulf Arab states and Iran "is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures Iran might takein line with its commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect ofthe sovreignty and territorial integrity of the region's states."     It denounced Iran's measures on the island of Abu Musa, which itshares with the United Arab Emirates, and the continued occupation of the Greater andLesser Tumbs islands.     Iran earlier this year extended its control over Abu Musa beyond asmall garrison it established there in 1971 under an agreement with the UAE emirate of Sharjah.     It has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on theisland for the UAE government. But diplomats say it continues to exercise its authorityover the whole island, which the UAE sess as as virtual annexation.     The Tumbs were occupied by the former Shah of Iran in 1971 and theUAE has since the Abu Musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as partof a general settlement.     The GCC leaders called on the U.N. to maintain sanctions againstIraq for not fully implementing Security Council resolutions following its 1990 invasion ofKuwait.     They endorsed once again the "Damascus Declaration," a pact signedwith Egypt and Syria after their troops took part in the U.S. led alliance that droveIraqi troops out of Kuwait.     But delegates said the leaders were unable to agree the details of afund they announced they would create at their last summit in Kuwait last yearwhich would have helped Egypt's and Syria's economic development programme.     They said the leaders could not agree on a breakdown ofcontributions from each state although the total amount had been scaled down to $6 billion from the$10 billion agreed last year.     The fact that the leaders of all GCC states -- Saudi Arabia,Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar -- attended the summit was seen as a major achievement althoughtheir unity was only maintained with outside help.     Most delegations were not too worried for the moment about the slowprogress of the conservative rulers discussions on a future security structure for theregion that boasts the bulk of global oil and gas reserves.     The leaders were unable to choose between two proposals.     One put forward by a summit committee headed by Oman's Sultan Qaboosto create a 100,000-man rapid deployment force that could rush to defend any memberagainst external aggression, such as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.     Another was a Saudi-supported plan to expand the existing 10,000-man"Peninsula Shield" force which had so far played a largely symbolic role and iscommanded by a Saudi general.     Little headway was made on plans for a reginal common marketalthough the summit called for concrete proposals to be submitted to next year's summit dueto be held in Saudi Arabia next December.  REUTER YA DYA DJG RTw  12/23 0835  GULF LEADERS END SUMMIT     ABU DHABI, Dec 23, Reuter - Gulf Arab states ended a three-dayannual summit on Wednesday with an appeal to Iran to end its occupation of threestrategic Gulf islands as a condition for restoring friendly ties across the Gulf.     A joint statement issued after the summit, marked by relief over thesettlement of a row between two Gulf Cooperation Council members, also called forcontinued U.N. sanctions against Iraq.     It said Baghdad had failed to implement key Security Councildecisions following the expulsion of its troops from Kuwait early last year.     The summit broke no new ground on steps to achieve a Gulf commonmarket, but called on officials to present a plan for common external tarrifs for all sixmembers to the next summit which will be held in Saudi Arabia in December 1993.     The statement stressed that developing relations between the GulfArab states and Iran "is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures Iran might take inline with its commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect ofthe sovreignty and territorial integrity of the region's states."     It denounced Iran's measures on the island of Abu Musa, which itshares with the United Arab Emirates, and the continued occupation of the smallerislands, the Greater and Lesser Tumbs.     It expressed deep regret and extreme concern for the unjustifiedIranian measures which contradict a proclaimed wish to develop relations and called onIran to rescind those measures and end the occupation which it said was "shaking peaceand stability in the area."     Iran earlier this year extended its control over Abu Musa beyond asmall garrison it established there in 1971 under an agreement with the UAE emirate of Sharjah.     It has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on theisland for the UAE government but diplomats in the region say that its security forcescontinue to exercise their authority over the whole island.     The UAE has seen this as virtual annexation.     The Tumbs were occupied by the former Shah of Iran in 1971 and theUAE has since the Abu Musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as partof a general settlement.  REUTER YA DYA DJG RTw  12/26 1441  IRAN HINTS IT READY TO GO TO WAR OVER ISLANDS  (Eds: updates with SNSC statement)     NICOSIA, Dec 26, Reuter - Iran told its Gulf Arab neighbours onSaturday it was ready to defend militarily three disputed islands, reminding them of itseight-year war with Iraq.     "Our eight-year defence (in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war) has proved tothe world that our brave nation will never hesitate to defend the sovereignty andsafeguard the territorial integrity of Iran," Iran's Supreme National Security Council(SNSC) said.     A meeting of the heads of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Councilvoiced full support on Wednesday for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in its dispute with Iranover the Gulf islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tumb and Lesser Tumb.     The move has triggered strong Iranian criticism and warnings.Besides the UAE, the GCC also groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.     Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who chaired the SNSC'smeeting on Saturday, said during his Friday prayer sermon at Tehran University:"Iran is surely stronger than the likes of you. To reach these islands one has to crossa sea of blood."     The SNSC, quoted by the official Iranian news agency IRNA receivedin Cyprus, also criticised the GCC and described its support of the UAE as "irresponsible."    "No country will ever be able to covet even an inch of Iranian soil,"said the SNSC.     Earlier on Saturday, the English language Tehran Times, believed tobe close to the Foreign Ministry, said the UAE should be aware that Iran'sself-restraint had certain limits.     It dismissed a UAE claim to the islands as unfounded and said a 1971agreement to share Abu Musa with the UAE emirate of Sharjah still applied.     "The idea of Abu Dhabi officials that Tehran would always refrainfrom responding to the blows inflicted by them was "childish," Tehran Times said.     IRNA said the newspaper was commenting on the GCC statement whichurged Iran to reverse what it says is the annexation of Abu Musa island and to pullout of the two other islands.     Iran says the islands near the entrance to the Gulf havehistorically belonged to it. The dispute flared this year after Iran tightened its control over Abu Musa.  REUTER AF JCH RTw  12/28 1011  TEHRAN PAPER WANTS IRAN REVIVE CLAIM TO BAHRAIN     TEHRAN, Dec 28, Reuter - Radical Iranian newspapers, angered by GulfArab claims to three disputed islands, are hitting back with demands that Tehran reviveits claim to Bahrain and consider improving ties with Iraq.     President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and senior officials stronglycondemned a statement last week by leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) backing theUnited Arab Emirates (UAE) in its dispute with Iran over the Gulf islands.     But the newspapers Salam and Jomhuri Eslami demanded that Tehran gofurther than restating its resolve to defend its sovereignty over the islands of AbuMusa, Greater Tumb and Lesser Tumb.     "It is not very clear why the Sheikh of Bahrain has joined theothers," Jomhuri Eslami said. The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.     "If historical records are to be the criterion, the sheikh ofBahrain should go about his own business and the rule of Iranian people in Bahrain, whichbelonged to Iran until 1970, should be re-established," the paper said.     "It is fitting for the foreign ministry to raise the question ofIran's sovereignty over Bahrain...and start a serious and effective drive to end theseparation of Bahrain from Iran," it added.     The late Shah of Iran relinquished Iran's claim to Bahrain in 1970,a year before the island became an independent state.     Iranian leaders since the 1979 Islamic revolution have carefullyavoided raising the Bahrain issue although it is occasionally brought up in the press duringperiods of tension with conservative Arab states across the Gulf.     Salam newspaper said the GCC stand showed that the policy ofappeasing pro-Western Gulf Arab rulers had backfired.     "No matter how much you smile at sheikhs on the southern coast ofthe Persian Gulf, it is the United States and the West which speak the last word," it said.     "They (the sheikhs) are nobody," Salam said, adding that Iran shouldrevise its policy towards its neighbours, especially its former war enemy Iraq.     "Disregarding the logical potential of expanding ties withIraq...and going along with some Saudi-backed trends among the Iraqi opposition have played a rolein the formation of the current situation," the paper said.     Ties between Iran and Iraq, which fought a war from 1980 to 1988,improved briefly after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.     But Tehran, which denounced the invasion and remained neutral in theensuing war, again called for President Saddam Hussein's overthrow when he suppresseda Shi'ite Moslem revolt which swept southern Iraq after his 1991 defeat in Kuwait.

In 1948 it was the Arabswho refused to accept the existance of Israel BASED ON THE BORDERS SETBY THE UNITED NATIONS.  In 1956, Egypt closed off the Red Sea to Israelishipping, a clear antagonistic act.  And in 1982 the attack was a responseto years of constant shelling by terrorist organizations from the GolanHeights.  Children were being murdered all the time by terrorists and Israelfinally retaliated.  Nowhere do I see a war that Israel started so that the borders could be expanded.

[PTS] ----------------------------------------------------------------------[PTS] [PTS] [PTS]       The Conflict Over Nagorno-Karabakh: An Azeri Perspective[PTS]       --------------------------------------------------------[PTS]                            By Alec Rasizade[PTS] [PTS] [AR] Western readers have learned of the Nagorno (Upper) Karabakh[AR] controversy through reports from that remote area by Western[AR] correspondents and from commentaries by member of the long-established[AR] Armenian-American community.  Azeri views on this dispute have[AR] appeared rarely if at all in the Western news media.  Therefore let me[AR] present _Washington Report_ readers with some basic truths about the[AR] origins of the conflict.During the past two years, if one reads all the commentaries on the subject,a small minority of the writers have been Armenia or Azeri.The following should be interesting. [AR] Armenian leaders claim that Azerbaijan was the first to oppress and[AR] expel the Armenian minority from the Azerbaijani Republic.  Actually,[AR] the initiative to banish the Azeri minority and convert the Armenian[AR] Republic into a homogeneous state began in the winter of 1987-1988,[AR] when 165,000 Azeris were driven out of Armenia.  Following that move,[AR] there were massacres of Armenians in the Azerbaijani cities of Sumgait[AR]in February 1988 and two years later, in Baku in January 1990.This not true. Other than simply checking the newspapers, I will quote from anindependent human rights report. In the _PAX Cristi Netherlands_, 29 September1991, page 28, we read: "By mid-november, many incidents took place in several places in  Azerbaijan. The APF [Azeri Popular Front] challenged the Communist Party  for power. ... After ten days, the authorities came in with tanks to  reimpose their power. In Nakhitchevan, the last Armenian villages were  deported. In Ganja, Armenians were attacked and killed. All 40,000   Armenian inhabitants fled the city..."  Between 22 November and 8 December 1988, refugees from Ganja arrived in  Armenia while all 167,000 Azeris in Armenia were chased away."In this part of the world February 1988 [start of organized anti-Armenian pogroms in Azerbaijan] come before November and December of 1988![AR] Azeri parliamentary committees have compiled evidence indicating that[AR] both events were inspired from Moscow to secure Russian imperial rule[AR] in the Transcaucasus, according to the Roman principle of "divide and[AR] rule."  Similar conspiracies are evident throughout the five-year[AR] history of the conflict.It is interesting that the Azeris killed, burnt, raped the Armenians but theperpetrators blame Russians, and Armenians themselves on other occasions. [AR] Each time the parties have been about to reach an agreement (in[AR] Zheleznovodsk, Moscow, Tehran, Rome, Geneva and Alma-Ata), an[AR] invisible hand provoked further bloodshed.  Those interested in[AR] maintaining the Azeri-Armenian conflict, as well as the Georgian[AR] turmoil, are imperialist forces in Russia, and probably in Iran.Incorrect! When were the people of Nagorno-Karabakh ever involved in anagreement? Never. Until Azerbaijan sits down with the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh there will never be an end to this conflict. [AR] The Armenian offensive last spring created more than 100,000 new Azeri[AR] refugees from the captured towns of Upper and Lower Karabakh and[AR] adjacent rural districts.  Today 500,000 Azeri refugees throng the[AR] city of Baku and environs, providing more problems for the newly[AR] elected Popular Front government, which is opposed by the rigidly[AR] nationalistic National Independence Party. It's called war. If the Azerbaijanis didn't try to deport and allow the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in their ways, keep their Armenianculture, these Armenians would not have had to defend their existence. TheAzeris should not have assumed that Armenians were going to roll over andplay dead. [AR] How can a Western-style democracy survive in a small Muslim country[AR] where 1 million of the 7 million inhabitants are unemployed?  In the[AR] absence of any international effort to help Azeri refugees, as Kurdish[AR] and Bosnian refugees have been helped, how can the Azeri government[AR] reject the demand of these exiles to recapture their lands, homes and[AR] possessions?The Azeri government should have thought about such thnings before theyattempted to deprive Armenians of "lands, homes, and possessions". [AR] Such simple realities must be understood in the West.[AR] Misunderstanding Caucasian politics leads both Western and Russian[AR] public opinion to imagine a permanent, and therefore irreversible,[AR] ethnic and religious rivalry in the Caucasus.True, and you, Dr. Alec Rasizade, should practice what you preach! [AR] I think Western reluctance to interfere derives from this idea.[AR] Meanwhile, continuation of the war could draw both Eastern and Western[AR] states into the conflict through activation of various security[AR] alliances.  These include, on the Armenian side, the Moscow-led[AR] Commonwealth forces under the Tashkent mutual security pact, signed[AR] May 15, 1992.  On the Azeri side, should Turkey get involved as the[AR] guarantor of the Nakhichevan autonomy through the Kars Treaty of Oct.[AR] 13, 1921, these include the North Atlantic Treaty forces.Western interference! Turkish intervention! The moment Turkey dares step intothis conflict it will close the doors of any chance of Turkey being part of Europe (as if it ever will) and will destroy the eastern third of Anatolia!Dr. Rasizade, international realpolitik is not as simple-minded as you wouldhave us believe. [AR] Upper Karabakh generally is described in Western press reports as an[AR]"Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan."  The truth is that the Armenians[AR] began to appear there only in the middle of the last century.Incorrect once again. A brief scan of history addresses such a foolishclaim. Armenians today, refer to the area of Nagorno-Karabakh as "Artsakh", which comes from the Urartian term "Urtekhe-Urtekhini". NO Azeris yet! Ancient Greeks referred to Artsakh as "Orkhistena". NO Azeris yet!In the first half of the 6th century B.C., Artsakh, as part of ErvandidArmenia of Media. NO Azeris yet!From the end of the 4th century B.C., Artsakh was part of the Armenian Kingdomof Ervan. NO Azeris yet!Artsakh was still part of the Armenian Empire of Tigran. Orkhistena, or Artsakh is refereed to by Strabo, as part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!After Armenia was divided between the Persian and Byzantine Empires in 387 A.D. until 428, Artsakh was part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!End of the 5th century, Utik and Artsakh became principalities of the Aranshakhiks. NO Azeris yet!By the 7th century an Artsakh dialect of Armenian formed. NO Azeris yet!Emperor Konstantin (913-959) addressees a letter to the Prince of Khachen "ToArmenia". Khachen was the central principality of Artsakh. NO Azeris yet!In the decree of Paul I (1797), the number of Armenian families in this areawas stated as 11,000.It was from the 16th to the 18th centuries that non-Armenians from CentralAsia, Asia Minor, and Kurdistan first began to be exercise political influencein the planes of Artsakh. Caucasian Muslims around Karabakh!In 1813 Karabagh becomes part of Russia. Officiallt part of Russia 1828. Some Muslims in Karabakh!In 1914, the number of Armenian churches in Nagorno-Karabagh was 224, 188priests, 206,768 parishioners in 224 Armenian towns and villages. The Armenianpercentage of the population was over 90%. MAX: 10% Azeris in Karabakh --assuming no Kurds!Consider the following statement by the Azerbaijani Revcom on December 1, 1920: "The Worker-Peasant Government of Azerbaidzan, having been informed of the  proclamation of Armenia a Soviet Socialist Republic, sends its greetings  to the brother people. From this day the previous boundaries between  Armenia and Azerbaidzan are annulled. Nagornyi Karabakh, Zangezur, and  Nakhichevan are recognized as integral parts of the Armenian Socialis  Republic.  Long live the brotherhood and union of the workers and peasants of Soviet  Armenia and Azerbaidzan!Chairman of the Revcom of AzerbaidzanN. NarimanovPeople's Commissar for Foreign AffairsGuseinov"[AR] A few years ago they celebrated the 150th anniversary of their[AR] resettlement from Persia to Karabakh, after it came under Russian[AR] rule. No, incorrect. The 1988 celebration was the 150th anniversary of Russian rulein the Caucasus, including Karabakh![AR] At the same time the Russian colonial administration also drew[AR] in Russian and German settlers, who were welcomed by Azeris.  How[AR] would Americans react if the large numbers of Armenians living in[AR] southern California suddenly claimed an Armenian homeland, and[AR] demanded separation from California?Non-sequitur.  [AR] Armenian historians insist that before the Armenian resettlement[AR] Karabakh was inhabited by aboriginal Christians.  That is correct.Armenian historians don't say this![AR] The people of medieval Caucasian Albania adopted Christianity in the[AR] fourth century.  But those ancient residents had no link to and[AR] nothing in common with Armenians.Considering the Caucasian Albans were of the Armenian Apostolic faith, andtheir utilization of the Armenian language in their liturgy, makes such an argument totally invalid![AR] Azeris would have a better claim to[AR] be successors of Albania, since Azeris have for centuries inhabited,[AR] dominated, and developed the Karabakh part of the Azeri nation.Wishing to be part of a people non-existent for nearly a millennium for geo-political advantage is rather outrageous. In addition to such absurdity,Azeris claim to be Turks, Persians, and all the while are Azerizing theirminorities, such as the Lezgians, Kurds, Tat, Talish, and a host of othernationalities which may amount to nearly half the population of Azerbaijan.[AR] Both Armenia and Azerbaijan last year signed the Final Act of the[AR] Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe of 1975, and the[AR] Paris Charter for New Europe of 1990, confirming their mutual[AR] adherence to the principle of inviolability of existing borders.  This[AR] principle means that the borders and territorial integrity of the[AR] Republic of Azerbaijan are to be guaranteed by all of the signatory[AR] nations, not just by Turkey.Such agreements do not give Azerbaijan the right to de-populate Karabakh ofArmenians. [AR] This is one key to intervention on behalf either of the U.N., the[AR] CSCE, the Commonwealth, NATO or Iran.  The second key to untying the[AR] Caucasian knot is to determine who is the aggressor, according to the[AR] U.N. definition of 1974.Fine, so why has Azerbaijan refused to allow UN troops into the Armenianenclave? What is Azerbaijan afraid of? Perhaps the fact that the territoryis the home of Armenians, the UN, would by definition, support the localpopulation!  [AR] When that is accomplished, the international community can and should[AR] apply to the aggressor in the Caucasus international sanctions such as[AR] those presently being employed against Serbia and Montenegro in the[AR] former Yugoslavia.  Such decisive collective international action can[AR] halt further aggression in Karabakh, and prevent the Armenian-Azeri[AR] conflict from growing and spreading. Azerbaijan's refusal to allow the Armenians of Karabakh to determine theirown future the is issue, not viewing isolating events out of context are actions that will address the Karabakh conflict. Viewing events in a warin isolation and out of context is like viewing the landing at Normandy asan act of Allied aggression!

Just christians, muslims, jews...Pardon me? Your ignorance cramps my conversation. Although the administrative mechanism was a strictly centralized one, the Ottoman Empire 'was a classical example of a pluralist social order.' The 'millet system' was the mechanism which shaped the social order of the multi-national Ottoman Empire and stood behind its continuity. As a matter of fact, because Islamic principles were in force in the Ottoman Empire, it was natural to use religious criteria to differentiate among the various communities which constituted the Empire. The 'millet' system began to be based on ethnicity in the 19th century under the influence of nationalism. Sousa writes of the existence of thirteen communities in the Ottoman Empire in addition to the Muslim 'millet' in 1914. These were: (1) Greeks attached to the Orthodox Patriarchate in Istanbul; (2) Catholics or Latins who were remnants of Genoese and Venetian merchants; (3) Gregorian Armenians attached to a Patriarchate in Istanbul; (4) Catholic Armenians; (5) Syrian Catholics attached to a Patriarchate in Mardin; (6) Chaldean Catholics attached to a Patriarchate in Mosul; (7) Syrian Jacobites attached to a Patriarchate in Mardin; (8) Protestants; (9) Melchites attached to a Patriarchate in Damascus; (10) Hebrews of two rites; (11) Bulgarian Catholics attached to the Bulgarian Exarch; (12) Maronites; and (13) Nestorians.[1] Scholars who studied the pluralistic social structure outlined briefly above, concluded that the social order of the Ottoman Empire fit the framework of the 'Mosaics Theory.'[2] [1] N.

Congradulations tim. I think the other people answeredyou on most of the factual parts(esp. about the internalconflicts policy). Israel very often gets away with morethan most other nations (Due to U.S. vetos). While I am notfamiliar with every instance I know that the reason SaudiArabia was not condemned for killig the pilgrims was that thepilgrims were iranian. Yes, the UN is biased but mostly infavor of the US and its allies (Including Israel, Saudi Arabiaand Pakistan) and against "Outlaw" countries like iran and morerecently Iraq. Far be it from me to support the repressivegovernments there but I think they get more slack than Israelfor things they do "wrong". Again the reason some condemnationsdon't occur lies in the race or country of the victims. Thegassed Iraqi kurds got associated with Iran in the war andsince Iran was perceived as worse than Iraq no condemnationresulted. The palestinians killed by arab countries involvedanother case of who cares. It seems that until very recently noone cared about how many palestinians died anywhere (includingin Israel and the occupied territories).Again I appreciate the lack of personal insults.

Here is my $0.02 on this and related subjects.One is curious to know the real reasons behind this and relatedpublic relations campaign about Iran in recent months. These include:1) Attempts to implicate Iran in the bombing of the New York Trade   Center. Despite great efforts in this direction they have not   succeeded in this. They, however, have indirectly created   the impression that Iran is behind the rise of fundamentalist   Islamic movements and thus are indirectly implicated in this matter.2) Public statements by the Secretary of State Christoffer and   other official sources regarding Iran being a terrorist and   outlaw state.3) And finally the recent broadcast of the Frontline program. I    suspect that this PR campaign against Iran will continue and   perhaps intensify.Why this increased pressure on Iran? A number of factors may havebeen behind this. These include:1) The rise of Islamic movements in North-Africa and radical   Hamas movement in the Israeli occupied territories. This   movement is basically anti-western and is not necessarily   fueled by Iran. The cause for accelerated pace of this    movement is probably the Gulf War which sought to return   colonial Shieks and Amirs to their throne in the name of   democracy and freedom. Also, the obvious support of Algerian   military coup against the democratically elected Algerian   Islamic Front which clearly exposed the democracy myth.   A further cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news   on the slaughter of Bosnian Moslems.2) Possible future implications of this movement in Saudi Arabia   and other US client states and endangerment of the cheap oil   sources from this region.3) A need to create an enemy as an excuse for huge defense   expenditures. This has become necessary after the demise of   Soveit Union.The recent PR campaign against Iran, however, seems to be directedfrom Israel rather than Washington. There is no fundamental conflictof interest between Iran and the US and in my opinion, it is in theinterest of both countries to affect reestablishment of normaland friendly relations. This may have a moderating effect on therise of radical movements within the Islamic world and Iran .--jamshid

Some lucky ones escaped to relative safety in Turkiye. The remaining others are being finished now by local Christians, the USA, and the rest of Europe.The Christian West is maintaining a tight arms ambargo on the Muslempeoples of Bosnia so they cannot deffend themslves while letting Christian Serbs and Croats torture, rape, and massacre the innocent Moslem peoples of Bosnia.It took Christian Europe for almost six centuries to achieve thisobjective of theirs and I do not think they will let it up. This will go on untill every single Moslem person (Bosnian, Turk, Albanian, etc)is tortured, raped, massacred, and driven out of their homes.

(by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was  first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some 'pretty   well suited theories', as usual)  And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian's lies...I also give the call number and page numbers again for the library use, which are:                   949.6 R 198     and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215                    > >It is not possible that [(*]'s text has 287 pages, mine has 353, and yours has>377!  Now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying "it is not possible..." ..If not, what is your point?  Differences in the number of pages? Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934.. No need to use the same book size and the same letter  charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!  The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year first published..  And you tried to hide the whole point.. the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given  by Serdar Argic exist!!  It was the issue, wasn't-it?    you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway?   You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a "crap"..

You should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion ondistortions propagated by several of your contemporaries. If you feel that you can simply act as an Armenian governmental crony in this forum you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed. This is not a lecture to another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist, but a fact.I will dissect article-by-article, paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line, lie-by-lie, revision-by-revision, written by those on this net, who plan to 'prove' that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds is nothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide. We are neither in x-Soviet Union, nor in some similar ultra-nationalist fascist dictatorship, that employs the dictates of Hitler to quell domestic unrest. Also, feel free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists,the Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armeniancriminal organizations.Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men,women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. You, and those like you, will not get away with the genocide's cover-up.Not a chance.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists                             a single Turkish soul.' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)

The Indonesians seem perfectly willing to not kill anyone whodoesn't get in their way: which is something the Khmer Rouge didn't do. Virtually everyone not in the Khmer Rouge suffered the "killing fields".(Once again, not to downplay the violence in Timor....)>> If so, why isn't he in Australia chanting "no blood for oil"?> > Probably because he thinks that this form of protest would be silly> and ineffective?  Or is that explanation too obvious?I don't agree.  Right now Australia is the most effective lever againstIndonesia.  They are negotiating for oil drilling rights off Timor, andstopping that process would go a long way towards making Indonesia realize thatpeople don't want to see the situation swept under the rug.Brett________________________________________________________________________________"There's nothing so passionate as a vested interest disguised as anintellectual conviction."

Karabag is 'Turkish' and will remain 'Turkish'. Here we are, almost at the end of the 20th century, and a whole community, the Azeri Turks of x-Soviet Armenia and Karabag, is facing forced assimilation, torture and murder on one hand and forced exodus, expulsion and genocide on the other, all because of their ethnic and religious background. And one should ask herself: is the world community really so powerless? Where are all those human rights advocates? Where are all the decent people? Are we going to let this human tragedy go on and do nothing about it? The numberof Azeris murdered by the terrorist Armenian army and its savagegangs is increasing. On the one hand they wish to distort the truthand on the other, they beg mercy from Turkiye.        The Age...Melbourne...6/3/92        By Helen WOMACK  .... Agdam, Azerbaijan, Thursday        The exact number of victims is still unclear,  but there can be         little  doubt that Azeri civilians were massacred  by  Armenian         fighters in the snowy mountains of Nagorno-Karabakh last week.         Refugees  from the enclave town of Khojaly,  sheltering in  the         Azeri border town of Agdam, give largely consistent accounts of         how  their  enemies  attacked their homes on the  night  of  25         February,    chased  those  who  fled  and  shot  them  in  the         surrounding forests. Yesterday, I saw 75  freshly dug graves in         one  cemetery  in  addition to four mutilated corpses  we  were         shown in the mosque when we arrived in Agdam late on Tuesday. I         also  saw women and children with bullet wounds in a  makeshift         hospital in a string of railway carriages.         Khojaly, an Azeri settlement in the enclave mostly populated by         Armenians,  had a population of about 6000. Mr.  Rashid Mamedov         Commander of Police in Agdam,  said  only about 500  escaped to         his  town.   " So where are the rest?".  Some might have  taken         prisoner, he said, or fled. Many bodies were still lying in the         mountains  because  the  Azeris were short  of  helicopters  to         retrieve them. He believed more than 1000 had perished, some of         cold in temperatures as low as minus 10 degrees.         One  refugee,  Rami Nasiru,  described how Khojaly residents at         first thought the attack was no more than the routine  shooting         to  which they had become accustomed in four years of conflict.         But  when  they  saw the Armenians with  a  convoy  of  armored         personnel carriers, they realised they could not hope to defend         themselves  with  machineguns and grenades,  and fled into  the         forests. In the small hours, the massacre started.         Mr.  Nasiru,  who believes his wife and two children were taken         prisoner,   repeated what many other refugees have said -  that         troops of the former Soviet army helped the Armenians to attack         Khojaly. "It is not my opinion, I saw it with my own eyes." Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists                             a single Turkish soul.' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)

'The most are inside houses. Come you and look.' 'No, dammit! My stomach isn't-' 'One is a Turkish officer in uniform. Him you must see.' "We were under those trees by the mosque, in an open space.... 'I don't believe you," I said, but followed to a nail-studded door. The   man pushed it ajar, then spurred away, leaving me to check on the corpse.   I thought I should, this charge was so constant, so gritted my teeth and   went inside. The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes, and was dark at first, for  its stone walls had only window slits. Rags strewed the mud floor around an  iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black  with soot. All looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. As  the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face  up, naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what  was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted,  as with Tartars rather than with Turks. Any uniform once on him was gone, so  I'd no proof which he was, and quickly went out, gagging at the mess of his   slashed genitals."p. 363 (first paragraph).  'How many people lived there?' 'Oh, about eight hundred.' He yawned. 'Did you see any Turk officers?' 'No, sir. I was in at dawn. All were Tartar civilians in mufti.' "The lieutenant dozed off, then I, but in the small hours a voice woke me -  Dro's. He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. Anyone keelhauled so long and furiously I'd never heard. Then abruptly Dro broke into  laughter, quick and simple as child's. Both were a cover for his sense of guilt, I thought, or hoped. For somehow, despite my boast of irreligion, Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would have been. From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around..... The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel's chattels, the last  scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags,  looms, even spinning-wheels. 'Thank you for a lot, Dro,' I said to him back in camp. 'But now I must  leave.'...We shook hands, the captain said 'A bientot, mon camarade.' And  for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains.  Like Lot's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all, doubtless in  a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran.'"p. 354."At morning tea, Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole high region called the Karabakh. Deep in tactics, they spoke Russian, but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust of promises made by tribal chiefs. A campaign shaped; more raids on Moslem villages."p. 358."It will be three hours to take," Dro told me. We'd close in on three sides."The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets," Merrimanovsaid, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow."That is for morale," Dro put in. "We must keep the Moslems in terror.""Soldiers or civilians?" I asked."There is no difference," said Dro. "All are armed, in uniform or not.""But the women and children?""Will fly with the others as best they may."p. 360."The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. Hundreds of feet  down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that,' said  Dro, pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.' Then, 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling; then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though  I heard our Utica brass roar. As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed, dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly. The came a shrill wailing. Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot. 'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries. At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and  tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly, through alders, on smoldering houses. Across trampled wheat my brothers-in- arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb."p. 361 (fourth paragraph)."Corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair,  large eyes. She looked about twelve years old. She lay in some stubble  where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. The bayonet  had gone through her back, I judged, for blood around was scant. Between  the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun  dress. The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He  lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the  pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed  just below his neck, into the spine.  There were grownups, too, I saw as I led the sorrel around. Djul was  empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's German-speaking  colonel. He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead."p. 358. "...more stories of Armenian murdering Turks when the czarist troops fled  north. My hosts told me of their duty here: to keep tabs on brigands,   Turkish troop shifts, hidden arms, spies - Christian, Red or Tartar -  coming in from Transcaucasus. Then they spoke of the hell that would   break loose if Versailles were to put, as threatened, the six 'Armenian'  vilayets of Turkey under the control of Erevan...  An Armenia without Armenians!

This is the worst crime in history. It happened to the Turks in eastern Anatolia and the Armenian dictatorship. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were killed in the worst ways imaginable. It is sickening to think that the human race is capable of such actions, but there is no denying the fact that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslims happened.People of Turkiye deeply sympathize with those whose relatives were killed in the Turkish genocide. I understand their anger that there are those who still deny that the Turkish genocide indeed took place, despite the fact that the genocide of 2.5 million Turks has been well documented over the past six decades.

Here is mine: During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920, the Armenian Dictatorship through a premeditated and systematic genocide, tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their 1,000 year homeland.The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instanceof Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.This event is incontrovertibly proven by historians, governmentand international political leaders, such as U.S. Ambassador Mark Bristol, William Langer, Ambassador Layard, James Barton, Stanford Shaw, Arthur Chester, John Dewey, Robert Dunn, Papazian, Nalbandian, Ohanus Appressian, Jorge Blanco Villalta, General Nikolayef, General Bolkovitinof, General Prjevalski, General Odiselidze, Meguerditche, Kazimir, Motayef, Twerdokhlebof, General Hamelin, Rawlinson, AvetisAharonian, Dr. Stephan Eshnanie, Varandian, General Bronsart, Arfa,Dr. Hamlin, Boghos Nubar, Sarkis Atamian, Katchaznouni, Rachel Bortnick, Halide Edip, McCarthy, W.

Mark Alan Epstein, 'The Ottoman Jewish Communities and their Role  in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries,' Klaus Schwarz Werlag,  Freiburg (1980).  page 19: <<During the fifteenth century, when the Ottomans were struggling to  reestablish themselves in the Balkans, there was considerable turmoil  among the Jewish communities in Central and Western Europe. Even if  the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the  fourteenth are minimized, it is easy to understand the attraction which  Ottoman life, particularly when compared to life in Europe, held for the  Jews. There is no way to tell how many Jews left Christendom for the  realm of the rising Muslim Ottomans, but with each account of persecution  in or expulsion from Christian countries it is recorded that some Jews  fled to Ottoman territory. The regularity of these reports suggests that  the Ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that  there was a regular trickle of Jewish families moving southward and  eastward from Western and Central Europe. (...) It is evident that the  effects of plague, late crusades, and the general intolerance and  persecution of Jews in Christian Europe resulted in the redirection  of the whole focus of Jewish life which, for more than two centuries,  was to be oriented toward Muslim East.>>  page 21:  <<In the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official  in the  Edirne Jewish community was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati the Ashkenazi  Chief Rabbi of the city. He was the most important rabbi in the city and  the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation  of the Edirne Jewry in the fifteenth century. Sarfati himself was from  Christian Europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two  recent arrivals from there, who, upon seeing the prosperity and freedom  of the Ottoman Jews, prevailed upon him to write their European  coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate.  This remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant  conditions in the Ottoman domains, but described as well the ease of  travel to Palestine and the holy places, an attraction to those who  would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there.>> (*)  page 41: <<...the impression gained from the Hebrew sources is that the Jews were firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them and the Ottomans, especially in comparison to relations with the Christians of Europe. Confirmation of the commonality of interests between Muslims and Jews is also indicated by the fact that European Christians perceived the Jews as allies of Islam and were well aware of Muslim-Jewish cooperation. Certainly the activity of important Jewish financiers and politicians representing the Ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed. European sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers. In addition it appears that Christian pirates plundered ''Turks and Jews,''  their sworn enemies, and that Europeans considered the Jews to be agents who regularly reported to the Ottomans. There are well-known examples of overt Jewish support for the Ottomans in the struggle against European powers. The two best known instances of Jewish support for the campaigning Ottomans are the frequently cited instances of the Jewish contributions to the conquests of Buda, in the early sixteenth century, and of Rhodes. We also have reports of sympathy for the Ottomans during the siege of Chios. An unpublished Ottoman document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some Greek towns...>> page 43:  <<It is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally accepted fact that the interests of Jews and Muslims coincided frequently, and all parties involved, Jews, Muslims, and Christians, were aware of the situation.>> page 46: <<...it seems that the relations between Greeks and Jews were not particularly cordial. The two groups had little in common, few common interests, and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition which could serve as the basis for cooperation, rather than enmity. If there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it was that between Muslims and Jews, neither of whom had much in common with the Orthodox.>> page 46: <<The general impression of Muslim-Jewish relations in the Ottoman context during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of interests. From the earliest times the Ottomans seem to have welcomed Jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element. The Jewish response to this tolerance was a steady flow of Jews from Christian countries to Ottoman domains.>> page 151:  <<From the period before 1453 we have only a few indications that the  Ottoman-Jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would  characterize it for years afterward, but the liberality of the Ottomans,  in contrast to the intolerance of the Byzantines, and the protection and  the security which the Ottomans offered, in comparison to conditions  elsewhere, leave little doupt that even then both the Ottomans and the  Jews recognized their mutual interests...>>  page 161:  <<It is impossible to say how fundamental the Jews were in the success  of the Ottomans in rebuilding Istanbul or in Ottoman mercantile success  in the sixteenth century. That they played an important role in both  cannot be doupted. It is also unclear whether they were important enough  to say that the Ottomans would not have experienced their great success  without the Jews and that no other group could have been found to serve  the Ottomans as well as did the Jews. It is, however, unmistakably clear  that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable  partnership between Jews and the non-Jewish society in which they lived.  We must conclude that the Ottomans could probably not achieved their  success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the  Jews did. Certainly for the Jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries  the Ottoman Empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home.>>(*) A version of Rabbi Sarfati's [Tzarfati] letter is given by Prof.Shaw:  page 32:  <<Your cries and sobs reached us. We have been told of all the troubles  and persecutions which you have to suffer in the German lands....I hear  the lamentation of my brethren...The barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly  oppresses the faithful children of the chosen people...The priests and  prelates of Rome have risen. They wish to root out the memory of Jacob  and erase the name of Israel. They always devise new persecutions. They  wish to bring you to the stake...Listen my brethren, to the counsel I will  give you. I too was born in Germany and studied Torah with the German  rabbis. I was driven out of my native country and came to the Turkish land,  which is blessed by God and filled with all good things. Here I found rest  and happiness; Turkey can also become for you the land of peace...If you  who live in Germany knew even a tenth of what God has blessed us with  in this land, you would not consider any difficulties; you would set out  to come to us...Here in the land of the Turks we have nothing to complain  of. We possess great fortunes; much gold and silver in our hands. We are  not oppressed with heavy taxes, and our commerce is free and unhindered.  Rich are the fruits of the earth. Everything is cheap, and every one of us  lives in peace and freedom. Here the Jew is not compelled to wear a yellow  hat as a badge of shame, as is the case in Germany, where even wealth and  great fortune are a curse for a Jew because he therewith arouses jealousy  among the Christians and they devise all kinds of slander against him  to rob him of his gold. Arise my brethren, gird up your loins, collect  your forces, and come to us. Here you will be free of your enemies, here  you will find rest...>>[13][13] Israel Zinberg, A History Of Jewish Literature. vol.V.

ED> ED> Elias     The above claim that you do not hate anybody may not be quite    true.  The falsity of this statement is easily visible in the    intellectual corruption that dominates everything you post in    this group.  Your complete lack of objectivity toward Israel,     and Jewish identity in general, reveal biases that indicate a    great steaming heap of hatred!        You certainly have shown a genuine hatred for honesty and for    objectivity. You repeatedly post items or quotes removed from     their original context so that they can be used to further an     agenda of rabid opposition to the very existence of Israel.    You have used this dishonest technique to paint a false image     of several Israeli leaders.  I can't say if you actually HATE    these leaders, but the lies and misrepresentations of them do    suggest that you have a visceral prejudice against them.        So, while you claim that you do not hate anybody, there is an    ample body of evidence to suggest that this claim of yours is     false.  It is obvious that you hate Israel, and it is evident    that you hate the Jewish people.    And, if you are Jewish, you are a self-hating Jew.  There can    be no doubt of this.  Although you will call upon your Jewish    background in an effort to claim the high moral ground, there    is no doubt that you would like to see the Jewish people fade    away completely, as a people.  Your advocacy of intermarriage    for the purpose of dissolving the Jewish people is proof that     you hate the Jewish people.    And by your effort to superimpose the meaninglessness of your    own Jewishness on all Jews, you've clearly demonstrated to me     that you hate yourself.                                            *       *       *       *    "Who is a Jew?

The following letter, which represents a small portion of the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical documents, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs, was sent to President Bill Clinton, members of Congress, editors, program directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and radio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people. On April 23 of every year, the people of Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the lost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their lives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations may live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and prosperously.------------------------- letter ----------------------------------During the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day, Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland, which is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocidein order to shift international public opinion away from its politicalresponsibility.2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish Genocide.3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism throughthe ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-SovietArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence throughterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supportersof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community frommaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorialdemands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish peoplewill unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victimsof the Turkish Genocide demand:1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian Dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish andKurdish people;3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officiallyrecognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuseto succumb to all Armenian political pressure;5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of 2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in theefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new generation has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politicallymature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, throughall necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the armed struggle. Therefore, the victims of the Turkish Genocide call uponall Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in the political, cultural and religious activities of the 78th Anniversaryof the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

Your fascist grandparents exterminated 2.5 million Muslim peoplebetween 1914 and 1920.2. Your Nazi parents fully participated in the extermination of theEuropean Jewry during WWII.3. Your criminal cousins have been slaughtering Muslim women, childrenand elderly people in fascist x-Soviet Armenia and Karabag for the last four years.The entire population of x-Soviet Armenia now, as a result of the Genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people, are Armenians. For nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people lived on their homeland - the last one hundred under the oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation. The persecutionsculminated in 1914: The Armenian Government planned and carried out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their homeland. After one thousand years, Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks and Kurds. The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.Today, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia.Today, x-Soviet Armenian government covers up the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against humanity.x-Soviet Armenian government must pay for their crime of genocide against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds.Turks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands, to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland.During the 78th Anniversary, we come once again reiterate theunity of the Muslim People, the timelessness of the Turkishand Kurdish Demands and the desire to pursue the strugglefor that restitution - a struggle that unites all Turks and Kurds.Today, we appeal to all Turkish and Kurdish people in the United States and Canada to participate en masse in the Commemorative Events, be they cultural, political or religious.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

You did not fully answer my question whether Israeli ID cardsidentify the holders as Jews or Arabs. You imply that U.S.citizens must identify themselves by RACE. Is that true ? Or arejust trying to mislead the reader ? Do you know of any democraticcountry where people are asked to reveal their ethnical orreligious identity to any public official who so requests ?2.  The answer to the second question is evasive. There are allkinds of maps issued.  They are not equivalent to State policy.You did not respond to my question.3.  Your answer to the third question (Israeli nuclear arsenal) isinteresting. You say that Israeli 'probably' stocks nuclearweapons. What evidence have you for maintaining that ?4.  My fourth question was answered by someone else who posted aMa'ariv article documenting such cases. I did not ask about caseslike Vanunu (everybody knew he was tried and imprisoned) but aboutthose about whom nobody even knows that they have been tried andimprisoned.5.  Thanks for clarifying the question concerning the legal statusof the inhabitants of the occupied territories. From it Iunderstand that there are two sets of laws in these ares, one forthe occupier (civil law) and one for the occupied (military law).The law allows Israeli Arabs to settle in Hebron, it seems. If so,why doesn't it allow Hebron Arabs to settle in Israel ?6. Your answer to the question concerning rights to returnconflicts with what I was told, namely that hundreds of thousandsof non-Jews who left for some reason or other the area underIsrael control during the war of 1947-8, were prevented fromreturning for the sole reason they were not Jews. Jews who alsoleft, for example to Europe, to avoid the clashes, were allowed toreturn. How can you justify such discrimination, if this is true ?Is the mere fact of a person leaving area of combat to seek refugesomewhere else a reason for stripping him of his right to live inhis homeland ?7.  Somebody answered my 7.question regarding Y. Rabin signing anorder for ethnical cleansing in 1948. According to thatinformation, Y. Rabin signed the order for the expulsion of allinhabitants of Lydda and Ramleh, about 50,000 people.  Theseexpulsions were helped by massacres of civilians and otheratrocities which remind Bosnia. I was referred to a book byIsraeli journalist Benny Goodman called The Origin of thePalestinian Refugee Problem, published by Cambridge UniversityPress. Is this book available in your library ?8.  You maintain that there are some Israeli Arabs living inIsraeli kibbutzim. I wonder how many and where. There is verylittle evidence available about that. As much as I know, manyArabs are working *for* kibbutzim, even for many years, but arenot accepted as members. Could it be that kibbutzim do not wantArabs ?9.  My question about the lack of civil marriage in Israel waswhether it is true that the Israeli legislator intended todiscourage intermarriage. You did not address this question butevaded it by saying that the 'entire religious establishment wantsto keep it what way'. I am certain that if only religiouscommunities in the U.S. would be asked, they would gladly abolishcivil marriage so that people would depend upon rabbis and prieststo officiate marriages. But Israel has always been ruled by asecular majority. Your answer is not satisfactory.I would be glad to have some more input from you after thesecomments.Elias

Your fascist grandparents exterminated 2.5 million Muslim peoplebetween 1914 and 1920.2. Your Nazi parents fully participated in the extermination of theEuropean Jewry during WWII.3. Your criminal cousins have been slaughtering Muslim women, childrenand elderly people in fascist x-Soviet Armenia and Karabag for the last four years.The entire population of x-Soviet Armenia now, as a result of the Genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people, are Armenians. For nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people lived on their homeland - the last one hundred under the oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation. The persecutionsculminated in 1914: The Armenian Government planned and carried out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their homeland. After one thousand years, Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks and Kurds. The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.Today, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia.Today, x-Soviet Armenian government covers up the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against humanity.x-Soviet Armenian government must pay for their crime of genocide against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds.Turks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands, to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland.During the 78th Anniversary, we come once again reiterate theunity of the Muslim People, the timelessness of the Turkishand Kurdish Demands and the desire to pursue the strugglefor that restitution - a struggle that unites all Turks and Kurds.Today, we appeal to all Turkish and Kurdish people in the United States and Canada to participate en masse in the Commemorative Events, be they cultural, political or religious.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

I am sick and tired of this 'DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA' sentance attributed   to Islamic movements and the PLO; it simply can't be proven as part of their   plan !   (Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity   since it was coined by Bnai Brith)   What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in, as far as I can get from the Arab media,   is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic   Law. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in   Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants.   However, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their   homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political   thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the   Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.   As for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind.   Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true   super-power in the region, the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the   Jews used to establish their state : Religion.   Ahmed.Forget the syntax, Ahmed, and focus on the semnatics. The fact is thatthe PLO does not recognize Israel's right to exist. This is perfectlyobvious from the PLO covenant (Cairo, 1968). The covenant calls forthe destruction of the "Zionist entity". As far as I know theIsrael-destruction clauses still exist in the document which specifiesthe purpose for the existence of the PLO. If you would like, I canpost the relevant caluses.Now the Hamas ideal is far more radical, it seems. I know it has beenposted here several times, and while I do not have a copy of it, I amsure that someone does and he (or she, of course) would be more thanhappy to repost it.Regardless of phrasing, groups like Hamas, and the Hezbollah, andeven the newly moderate and politically-correct PLO, have at the veryheart of their ideologies the need for the destrcution of Israel.It just seems to me that Mr. Davidsson's suggestion that Jews supportpeople envolved in these organizations is not a particularly appealingone to many Jews.Harry.

I don't know whether anybody formulated and proposed such an index or criteria to determine the magnitude of a genocide as mentioned and advised by Toynbee. If one ever does you will easily see the magnitude of the crime of genocide committed by the Armenians, by massacring an alienpopulation under their rule which constituted about 40% of their totalpopulation and they did it only within a time period of a little overtwo years in which they enjoyed having full control over this population.Now I would like to ask you:  Is there any other genocide in the history of mankind similar to   this one?And again I would like to ask you:  Whether the silent and unmourned martyrdom of these hundreds of thousands  of Turks of the Republic of Armenia who were exterminated as a "Final  Solution" to Turco-Tartar problems in Armenia is similar or not  to the martyrdom of six million Jews in Europe as a final solution to  Jewish problems?Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

Deal? Democracy in action.Are you the 'truelove' or 'falselove' of 'Arromdian' of the ASALA/SDPA/ARFTerrorism and Revisionism Triangle? "If Turks had behaved like Christians to use force to convert to Islam thenations which they brought under their power, to which no one could haveopposed, today there would be no Eastern problem. But Turks did not do so. They obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody "to worship in their ownway" centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum. Thus,in an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when people in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefsdiffered from theirs, the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where theinquisition did not exist, where deaths at the stake were unheard of and where accusations of witchcraft were not made. And the barbarian (!) Turkeywas the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhereby the Christians, could find asylum. These facts demonstrate that Muslimcountries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christiancountries."[1]"The Turks, who are a conquering nation, did not Turkify the nations that cameunder their rule; instead, they respected their religions and traditions. Itwas a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead ofRussian or Austrian rule. Because otherwise there would not have been aRomanian nation today" (Popescu Ciocanel)."Turks rule over people under their administration only externally, withoutinterfering with their internal structures. On account of this, the autonomyof minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the mostadvanced European countries."[2]"...human beings hate each other on account of religious differences. This flawis older than Islam and Christianity. But there has never been any examplesof this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on accountof his religion. If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case ofsimple contempt among us too, or if it did not keep translating itself intoaction, many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselveshappy!" (A. de Mortraye).[3]"Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of theinquisition. On the contrary, it served as an asylum for the unfortunatevictims of Christian fanaticism. If you look into history, you will see thatin the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain andPortugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have beenliving there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years,and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against thecruelty of Christians, especially that of the Orthodoxes. No Jew is able toappear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens, even today. In Turkey,however, if the Israelites are insulted by the Greek and Armenian communities,local courts immediately take them under their protection.""In that vast and calm country of the sultan, all religions and nations areliving together peacefully. Although the mosque is superior to the church andthe synagogue, it does not replace them. Because of this, the Catholic sect ismore free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon. In addition to the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this sect, neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. While thedead are being taken to the graves, a long line of priests bear processionalcandles and chant Catholic hymns. When all the priests in all the churches inthe Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clericalprocessions during the Eucharist celebrations, chanting hymns and bearingtheir crosses and religious banners, a detachment of soldiers escorts themwhich forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of priests."

To throw the Gazans into the sea, in accordance with Yitzhak Rabin's     wish and that of many Zionists.3.  For Israelis and Palestinians to come to an honorable and fair (I   don't attempt to say just) settlement, which would allow each person   to live in dignity in his country in freedom and equality.I personnaly opt for the third alternative.

Why don't we not talk about the "official" definition offoreign aid and talk about where money is really spent.  More money is spentstationing troops in Germany (ie paying the troops, maintaining bases and equip,etc) than in Israel.  Plus, Israel does not ask the US to send troops to fighther battles.  If you look at the amount of money spent defending Korean shipping lanes, Norway, and other trouble spots in the world, you will see thataid to Israel - from a practical standpoint - is not that much.  And so what -so what if Israel gets the most (assuming I buy your feeble argument)?  What is your point?  Do you not want to subsidize Israel?  Well, you have two options1) Start your own campaign, get elected as president, and then force congressto cut all aid to Israel or 2) get the fuck out!

You are now making the exact pointthat I've made several times but with a different definition of religion.  You don't nothave to believe in the "religious" aspects of Judaism to be a Jew (this would confineJudaism to be just a religion in the sense of a Christianity.).  So, by converting out ofJudaism, I don't mean just not believing in the god of Judaism.  I mean voluntarilyremoving yourself from the Jewish nation.  I am an agnostic but still consider myselfJewish because of my cultural heritage.  (I admit that many religious jews would arguethat I am not completely jewish because of my lack of faith, but Judaism is a religion ofdissent and debate isn't it?).  The fact that one can opt to become Jewish simply byconverting to Judaism makes the nation of the jewish people the *least* racist and mostopen nation.  We have no quotas!So I will once again make my point.  Defining a member of the Jewish nation by religion(not, as you say, religious belief) is NOT racism.  You come to your incorrect conclusionbecause you use a different definition for religion when you define the law of return andwhen you define judaism.-Adam Schwartz

All the rest were civilians, including eight women and three small children. Two groups, apparently families, had fallen together, the children  cradled in the women's arms.

But they  attacked, and our defence force couldn't do anything against their tanks.'   Other survivors described how they had been fired on repeatedly on their  way through the mountains to safety.

The arrangements will not have a     territorial application, nor will they apply to the Israeli population     of the territories or to the Palestinian inhabitants of Jerusalem;   >Residual powers not delegated under the ISGA will be reserved by Israel;   >Israelis will continue to live and settle in the territoriesd;   >Israel alone will have responsibility for security in all its aspects-    external, internal- and for the maintenance of public order;   >The organs of the ISGA will be of an administrative-functional nature;   >The exercise of powers under the ISGA will be subject to cooperation and     coordination with Israel.    >Israel will negotiate delegation of powers and responsibilities in the     areas of administration, justice, personnel, agriculture, education,    business, tourism, labor and social welfare, local police,    local transportation and communications, municipal affairs and religious    affairs.Several question do come to mind concerning the "success" we all hope for in the ongoing negotiation process. These arrangements certainly seem to be essentially a rejection of any Palestinian "interim" self-control. Without exposing itself to unwarranted risks and creating irresversible vulnerability, can Israel reasonably put forward (at later points in the negotiating process) more "relaxed" proposals for this"interim" period? How should proposals (from either side) be altered to temper their "maximalist" approaches as stated above? How can Israeli worries ,and desire for some "interim control", be addressed while providing for a  very *real* interim Palestinian self-governing entity?Tim>Later comment:>>There seem to be two perceptions that **have to be addressed**.

The following letter, which represents a small portion of the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical documents, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs, was sent to President Bill Clinton, members of Congress, editors, program directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and radio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people. On April 23 of every year, the people of Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the lost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their lives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations may live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and prosperously.------------------------- letter ----------------------------------During the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day, Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland, which is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocidein order to shift international public opinion away from its politicalresponsibility.2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish Genocide.3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism throughthe ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-SovietArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence throughterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supportersof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community frommaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorialdemands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish peoplewill unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victimsof the Turkish Genocide demand:1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian Dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish andKurdish people;3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officiallyrecognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuseto succumb to all Armenian political pressure;5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of 2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in theefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new generation has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politicallymature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, throughall necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the armed struggle. Therefore, the victims of the Turkish Genocide call uponall Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in the political, cultural and religious activities of the 78th Anniversaryof the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

A genocide of Armenians took placeduring peacetime.And it was a great tragedy for me personally, because I lost my father inthose days. He was still young. Born in 1926.On that day, February 28, we were at home. Of course we had heard that there was unrest in town, my younger brother Aleksandr had told us about it. But we didn't think . . . we thought that everything would happen outdoors, that theywouldn't go into people's apartments. About five o'clock we saw a large crowd near the Kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict. We were sitting at home watching television. We go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into Mir Street. This is right near downtown, next to the airline ticket office, our house is right nearby. That day there was a group of policeman with shieldsthere. They threw rocks at those policemen. Then they moved off in the direction of our building. They burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and started shouting for Armenians to come out of the building. We switched off the light. As it turns out, their signal was just the opposite: to turn on thelight. That meant that it was an Azerbaijani home. We, of course, didn't know and thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment.Suddenly there's pounding on the door. We go to the door, all four of us:there were four of us in the apartment. Father, Mother, my younger brotherAleksandr, and I. He was born in 1959. My father was a veteran of World War II and had fought in China and in the Soviet Far East; he was a pilot.We went to the door and they started pounding on it harder, breaking it down with axes. We start to talk to them in Azerbaijani, "What's going on? What's happened?" They say, "Armenians, get out of here!" We don't open the door, we say, "If we have to leave, we'll leave, we'll leave tomorrow." They say, "No, leave now, get out of here, Armenian dogs, get out of here!" By now they've broken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides. We hold them off as bestwe can, my father and I on one side, and my mother and brother on the other. We had prepared ourselves: we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment,and grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves. They broke in the door andwhen the door gave way, we held it for another half-hour. No neighbors, nopolice and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time. We held the door. They started to smash the door on the lock side, first with an axe, and then with a crowbar.When the door gave way--they tore it off its hinges--Sasha hit one of them with the axe. The axe flew out of his hands. They also had axes, crowbars, pipes, and special rods made from armature shafts. One of them hit my father in the head. The pressure from the mob was immense. When we retreated into theroom, one of them hit my mother, too, in the left part of her face. My brotherSasha and I fought back, of course. Sasha is quite strong and hot-tempered, hewas the judo champion of Sumgait. We had hammers in our hands, and we injured several of the bandits--in the heads and in the eyes, all that went on. But they, the injured ones, fell back, and others came to take their places, therewere many of them.The door fell down at an angle. The mob tried to remove the door, so as to go into the second room and to continue . . . to finish us off. Father brought skewers and gave them to Sasha and me--we flew at them when we saw Father bleeding: his face was covered with blood, he had been wounded in the head, and his whole face was bloody. We just threw ourselves on them when we saw that. We threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall, drovethem down to the third floor. We came out on the landing, but a group of the bandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in there, having closed the door behind them. We started tearing the door off to chase away the remaining ones or finish them. Then a man, an imposing man of about 40, an Azerbaijani, came in. When he was coming in, Father fell down andMother flew to him, and started to cry out. I jumped out onto the balcony and started calling an ambulance, but then the mob started throwing stones throughthe windows of our veranda and kitchen. We live on the fourth floor. And no one came. I went into the room. It seemed to me that this man was the leader of the group. He was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a fur collar. And he addressed my mother in Azerbaijani: "What's with you, woman, why are you shouting? What happened? Why are you shouting like that?"She says, "What do you mean, what happened? You killed somebody!" My father was a musician, he played the clarinet, he played at many weddings, Armenian and Azerbaijani, he played for many years. Everyone knew him. Mother says, "The person who you killed played at thousands of Azerbaijani weddings, he brought so much joy to people, and you killed that person." He says, "You don't need to shout, stop shouting." And when they heard the voice of this man, the 15 to 18 people who were in the other room opened the door and started running out. We chased after them, but they ran away. That man left, too. As we were later told, downstairs one of them told the others, I don't know if it was from fright or what, told them that we had firearms, eventhough we only fought with hammers and an axe. We raced to Father and started to massage his heart, but it was already too late. We asked the neighbors to call an ambulance. The ambulance never came, although we waited for it all evening and all through the night.Somewhere around midnight about 15 policemen came. They informed us they were from Khachmas. They said, "We heard that a group was here at your place, you have our condolences." They told us not to touch anything and left. Father layin the room.So we stayed home. Each of us took a hammer and a knife. We sat at home. Well,we say, if they descend on us again we'll defend ourselves. Somewhere around one o'clock in the morning two people came from the Sumgait Procuracy, investigators. They say, "Leave everything just how it is, we're coming back here soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything."Then people came from the Republic Procuracy too, but no one helped us take Father away. The morning came and the neighbors arrived. We wanted to take Father away somehow. We called the Procuracy and the police a couple of times,but no one came. We called an ambulance, and nobody came. Then one of the neighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should hide. We secured the door somehow or other. We left Father in the room and went up to the neighbor's.The excesses began again in the morning. The bandits came in several vehicles,ZIL panel trucks, and threw themselves out of the vehicles like . . . a landing force near the center of town. Our building was located right there. Acrowd formed. Then they started fighting with the soldiers. Then, in Buildings19 and 20, that's next to the airline ticket office, they started breaking into Armenian apartments, destroying property, and stealing. The Armenians weren't at home, they had managed to flee and hide somewhere. And again they poured in the direction of our building. They were shouting that there were some Armenians left on the fourth floor, meaning us. "They're up there, still,up there. Let's go kill them!" They broke up all the furniture remaining in the two rooms, threw it outside, and burned it in large fires. We were hiding one floor up. Something heavy fell. Sasha threw himself toward the door shouting that it was probably Father, they had thrown Father, were defiling the corpse, probably throwing it in the fire, going to burn it. I heard it, and the sound was kind of hollow, and I said, "No, that's from some of the furniture." Mother and I pounced on Sasha and stopped him somehow, and calmed him down.The mob left somewhere around eight o'clock. They smashed open the door and went into the apartment of the neighbors across from us. They were alsoArmenians, they had left for another city.The father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said, "Are you crazy? Why are you hiding Armenians? Don't you now they're checking all the apartments? They could kill you and them!" And to us :" . . . Come on, leave this apartment!" We went down to the third floor, to some other neighbors'. Atfirst the man didn't want to let us in, but then one of his sons asked him andhe relented. We stayed there until eleven o'clock at night. We heard the soundof motors. The neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers. We went downstairs. There was a light on in the room where we left Father. In the other rooms, as we found out later, all the chandeliers had been torn down. They left only one bulb. The bulb was burning, which probably was a signal they had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in ourMicrodistrict 3 where there had been a pogrom.With the help of the soldiers we made it to the City Party Committee and were saved. Our salvation--my mother's, my brother's, and mine,--was purely accidental, because, as we later found out from the neighbors, someone in the crowd shouted that we had firearms up there. Well, we fought, but we were onlyable to save Mother. We couldn't save Father. We inflicted many injuries on the bandits, some of them serious. But others came to take their places. We were also wounded, there was blood, and we were scratched all over--we got ourshare. It was a miracle we survived. We were saved by a miracle and the troops. And if troops hadn't come to Sumgait, the slaughter would have been even greater: probably all the Armenians would have been victims of the genocide.Through an acquaintance at the City Party Committee I was able to contact the leadership of the military unit that was brought into the city, and at their orders we were assigned special people to accompany us, experts. We went to 'pick up Father's corpse. We took it to the morgue. This was about two o'clock in the morning, it was already March 1, it was raining very hard and it was quite cold, and we were wearing only our suits. When my brother and I carried Father into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses. There were about six burned people in there, and the small corpse of a burned child. It was gruesome. I suffered a tremendous shock. There were about ten people there, but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were beingtaken to Baku. There was a woman's corpse there too, she had been . . . well, there was part of a body there . . . a hacked-off part of a woman's body. It was something terrible. The morgue was guarded by the landing force . . . The child that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old. It was impossibleto tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned. There was a man there, too, several men. You couldn't tell anything because their faces were disfigured, they were in such awful condition...Now two and a half months have passed. Every day I recall with horror what happened in the city of Sumgait. Every day: my father, and the death of my father, and how we fought, and the people's sorrow, and especially the morgue.I still want to say that 70 years have passed since Soviet power wasestablished, and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what happened  in Sumgait. It will go down in history.I'm particularly surprised that the mob wasn't even afraid of the troops. Theyeven fought the soldiers. Many soldiers were wounded. The mob threw fuel mixtures onto the armored personnel carriers, setting them on fire. They weren't afraid. They were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our troops. I saw the clashes on February 29 near the airline ticket office, rightacross from our building. And that mob was fighting with the soldiers. The inhabitants of some of the buildings, also Azerbaijanis, threw rocks at the soldiers from windows, balconies, even cinder blocks and glass tanks. They weren't afraid of them. I say they were sure of their impunity. When we were at the neighbors' and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket office I called the police at number 3-20-02 and said that they were robbing Armenian apartments and burning homes. And they told me that they knew that they were being burned. During those days no one from the police department came to anyone's aid. No one came to help us, either, to our home, even thoughperhaps they could have come and saved us.As we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs, near the bus station. Rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in fighting. So I think all of it was arranged in advance. They even knew in which buildings and apartments the Armenians lived, on which floors--they hadlists, the bandits. You can tell that the "operation" was  planned in advance.Thanks, of course, to our troops, to the country's leadership, and to theleadership of the Ministry of Defense for helping us, thanks to the Russianpeople, because the majority of the troops were Russians, and the troops suffered losses, too. I want to express this gratitude in the name of my family and in the name of all Armenians, and in the name of all SumgaitArmenians. For coming in time and averting terrible things: worse wouldhave happened if that mob had not been stopped on time.At present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the USSRProcuracy. I want to say that those bandits should receive the severestpossible punishment, because if they don't, the tragedy, the genocide, could happen again. Everyone should see that the most severe punishment is metedout for such deeds.Very many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest, in the mass disturbances. The mobs were huge.

And today, they put Azeris in the most unbearable conditions any other nation had ever known in history. Your fascist grandparents admitted their unspeakable crimes then. Why deny them now? Now the genocide of the truth by the criminal/Nazi Armenians? Not a chance.                               Source: "Men Are Like That" by Leonard Ramsden Hartill. The Bobbs-MerrillCompany, Indianapolis (1926). (305 pages). (Memoirs of an Armenian officer who participated in the genocide of 2.5  million Muslim people)"Foreword:""For example, we were camped one night in a half-ruined Tartar mosque,  the most habitable building of a destroyed village, near the border  of Persia and Russian Armenia. During the course of evening I asked  Ohanus if he could tell me anything of the history of the village and  the cause of its destruction. In his matter of fact way he replied, Yes,  I assisted in its sack and destruction, and witnessed the slaying of  those whose bones you saw to-day scattered among its ruins." p. 202 (first and second paragraphs)."We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as  ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work  of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village.  Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts  into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable  and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets  completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They  found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border  into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole  length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to  Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain  plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of  Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for  howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the  scattered bones of the dead." p. 15 (second paragraph)."The Tartars were, for the most part, poor. Some of them lived in villages  and cultivated small farms; many of them continued in the way of life of  their nomadic forefathers. They drove their flocks and herds from valley  to valley, from plain to mountain, and from mountain to plain, following  the pasturage as it changed with the seasons. They ranged from the salt  desert shores of the Caspian Sea far into the mighty Caucasus Mountains.  Even the village Tartars are a primitive people, only semicivilized.""I can see now that we Armenians frankly despised the Tartars, and, while  holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country, regarded and treated them as inferiors. The fact that the Russians looked down upon all Armenians in much the same way as Armenians regarded Tartars, far from proving a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors, intensified an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility."p. 20 (second paragraph)."Our men armed themselves, gathered together and advanced on the Tartar section of the village. There were no lights in the houses and the doors were barred, for the Tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great  fear. Our men hammered on the doors, but got no response; whereupon they smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last Tartar was slain. Throughout the hideous night, I cowered at home in terror, unable to shut my ears to the piercing screams of the helpless victims and the loud shouts of our men. By morning the work was finished."p. 109 (second paragraph)."As things were, the members of the Dashnack Party were without administrative experience; consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself incompetent to rule by legitimate means. The members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and outside the law. When they became a legally instituted, recognized governing body with the destiny of Armenia in their hands, they proved incompetent to  do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their  fight against the Russian and Turkish Governments in their outlaw days. The outstanding feature of their rule, now that they were in power, was, as in the old days, trial and execution without hearing. A man evoking the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him. The method  of execution was for a government 'mauserist' to walk up behind the condemned man in his home or on the street, place a pistol to the back of his head and blow out his brains. This simple way of getting rid of those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became a common way of paying debts."p. 203 (first paragraph)."A soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the Tartar. I saw the point of the weapon emerge through his back. ...Another soldier seized a rock  and pounded the Tartar's head with it... The Armenian who had bayoneted him sprang to his feet, wrested the weapon from the Tartar's body, and, raising it to his lips, licked it clean of blood, exclaiming in Russian, 'Slodkey! Slodkey!' (Sweet.)"p. 203 (second paragraph)."One evening I passed through what had been a Tartar village. Among the  ruins a fire was burning. I went to the fire and saw seated about it a group of soldiers. Among them were two Tartar girls, mere children. The girls were crouched on the ground, crying softly with suppressed sobs. Lying scattered over the ground were broken household utensils and other furnishings of Tartar peasant homes. There were also bodies of the dead."p. 204 (first paragraph)."I was soon asleep. In the night I was awakened by the persistent crying of a child. I arose and went to investigate. A full moon enabled me to make my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy that had been enacted. Guided by the child's crying, I entered the yard of a house, which I judged from its appearance must have been the home of a Turkish family. There in a corner of the yard I found a women dead. Her throat had been cut. Lying on her breast was a small child, a girl about a year old."p. 118."Slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow, the cart jolting and the loads swaying. Boys ran along the line of oxen, encouraging them with shrill Tartar cries, and belaboring the beasts with sticks. In the carts, the women, veiled as is the Tartar way, held children in their arms. Wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they sought protection from the wind and cold. A few old men plodded along on foot. Across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown. The leading oxteam reached this barrier and halted. The gunmen and other ruffians  concealed among the rocks opened fire. Women and children leaped and scrambled from the carts, screamed, ran and sought vainly for safety. This massacre was not complete. The Armenian soldiers in the near-by  barracks, hearing the firing and the turmoil, hurried to the scene.... That same day the abandoned Tartar quarter of Alexandropol was looted and completely destroyed."p. 192."Great swarms of peasants who had come out of their hiding-places on the retreat of the Turks followed our army as it advanced.... They entered into the city with the army and immediately began plundering the stores that had been left by the Turks."p. 193."Terrible vengeance was taken upon Tartars, Kurds and Turks. Their villages were destroyed and they themselves were slain or driven out of the country."p. 195."The fanatical Dashnacks hated the Turks above all others and then in order of diminishing intensity: Tartars, Kurds and Russians." p. 218. (First and second paragraphs)"Russian troops did terrible things in the Turkish villages...We Armenians  did not spare the Tartars....If persisted in, the slaughtering of prisoners,  the looting, and the rape and massacre of the helpless become commonplace  actions expected and accepted as a matter of course. I have been on the scenes of massacres where the dead lay on the ground, in numbers, like the fallen leaves in a forest. They had been as helpless and as defenseless as sheep. They had not died as soldiers die in the heat of battle, fired with ardor and courage, with weapons in their hands, and exchanging blow for blow. They had died as the helpless must, with their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself."p. 133 (first paragraph)"In this movement we took with us three thousand Turkish soldiers who had been captured by the Russians and left on our hands when the Russians abandoned the struggle. During our retreat to Karaklis two thousand of these poor devils were cruelly put to death. I was sickened by the brutality displayed, but could not make any effective protest. Some, mercifully, were shot. Many of them were burned to death. The method employed was to put a quantity of straw into a hut, and then after crowding the hut with Turks, set fire to the straw."p. 19 (first paragraph)"The Tartar section of the town no longer existed, except as a pile of ruins. It had been destroyed and its inhabitants slaughtered. The same  fate befell the Tartar section of Khankandi."p. 22 (second paragraph)"Many of our men had served in the Russian Army, and were trained soldiers. We Armenians were rich and possessed arms. Tartars had never received military training. They were poor, and possessed few arms beyond knives. ...Shortly after the killing of the Tartars in our village, the revolution in Russia was suppressed."p. 97 (third paragraph)"Within a few years, following the beginning of the movement, an invisible government of Armenians by Armenians had been established in Turkish  Armenia in armed opposition to the Turkish Government. This secret  government had its own courts and laws and an army of assassins called 'Mauserists' (professional killers) to enforce its decrees."p. 98 (first paragraph)"The Dashnacks were in continual open rebellion against the Turkish  Government."p. 98 (third paragraph)"...the Dashnacks engineered a general revolt of Armenians in Turkish Armenia under the mistaken belief that European nations would intervene and secure independence for Turkish Armenia."p. 99 (second paragraph)"The Dashnacks were fanatics."           p. 99 (third paragraph)"The Dashnacks took advantage of this situation and extended their  revolutionary activities into the Russian province. They instituted  a campaign of terrorism and employed threats and force in securing contributions to the party funds from rich Armenians. A wealthy man would be assessed a stipulated sum. Refusal to pay brought upon him a sentence of death.  Every member of the party was pledged to carry out orders without  question. If a man were to be assassinated, lots might be drawn to select an executioner or the job might be assigned to one of the 'mauserists' of the party."p. 130 (first paragraph)"...in moments of victory against Turks and Kurds or Tartars, they  [Armenians] have been remorseless in seeking vengeance."p. 130 (third paragraph)"The city was a scene of confusion and terror. During the early days of  the war, when the Russian troops invaded Turkey, large numbers of the  Turkish population abandoned their homes and fled before the Russian  advance."p. 159 (second paragraph)"I made a cannon, a huge gun to lift which required four men. I made balls for it. With my cannon the Armenians could knock down any of the Tartar houses and so they were able to drive the Tartars out."p. 181 (first paragraph)"The Tartar villages were in ruins."p. 189 (third paragraph)"The dead Tartar lay with his head in a pool of mud and blood, his  beard still setaceous and now crimsoned."Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists                             a single Turkish soul.' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)

These people include my neighbors in Jerusalemwith the children of whom I played as child. Their crime: Theyarenot Jews. My conscience does not accept such injustice, period. Mywork for justice is done in the name of my principled opposition to racismand racial discrimination. Those who protest against such practicesin Arab countries have my support - as long as their protest is basedon a principled position, but not as a tactic to deflect criticismfrom Israel. The struggle against discrimination and racism is universal.The Center for Policy Research is a name I gave to those activitiesundertaken under my guidance in different domains, and which commandthe support of many volunteers in Iceland. It is however not a formalinstitution and works with minimal funds.Professionally I am music teacher and composer. I have published several pieces and my piano music is taught widely in Europe.I would hope that discussion about Israel/Palestine be conducted ina more civilized manner.

The estimated population of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem. Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the  Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897, however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character  notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian  Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the  southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia."

The Greeks started massacring the Turkish population on Cyprus in 1974. In 1974, Turkiye stepped into Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population there. This is nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately, the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority.The people of Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July 15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop Makarios.The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organizationof Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should notforget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turksin Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried todestroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Ofcourse, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences for this irresponsible conduct.Turkish Cypriots are simply seeking guarantees that will preclude arepeat performance by the fanatical cadres of the Greeks' EOKA. If such assurances are not perfectly implemented, there is every reason to expect that the local Greeks will be misguided enough to perpetrate their past mistakes. On such an occasion, the Turkish side may not find it satisfactory to act with reluctance to go any further than before, for it is unacceptable to remain always defensive against cyclical vicious attacks. Therefore it would be better to have a true federationof two separate sections living in obligatory peace, rather than another armed confrontation that would be started by the Greeks and obligatorily but decisively terminated by the Turks. The present Greek government is trying to tyrannize the Turkish population in western Thrace by forbidding it its ethnic and religious rights, which were established through international treaties. One might be betteradvised to remember that misadventures against Turkiye do not serve Greece well.An offer of membership in the European Common Market as bait for concessions that may doom the Turks in Cyprus to extinction is not a viable course for Greece or her friends. Neither Turkish lives nor Turkish honor has been placed on the bidding block to be sold for commercial gain.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists                             a single Turkish soul.' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)

Hamas figuressignificantly in the Middle East equation. In December, Israeldeported more than 400 Palestinians to Lebanon in response toHamas's kidnapping and execution of an Israeli soldier. A longerversion appears in the May issue of Harper's Magazine, whichobtained and translated the tape.)      My name is Yasir Hammad al-Hassan Ali. I live in Nuseirat [arefugee camp in the Gaza Strip]. I was born in 1964. I finishedhigh school, then attended Gaza Polytechnic. Later, I went to workfor Islamic University in Gaza as a clerk. I'm married and I havetwo daughters.     The Qassam Battalions are the only group in Palestineexplicitly dedicated to jihad [holy war]. Our primary concern isPalestinians who collaborate with the enemy. Many young men andwomen have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the [Israeli]Security Services.     Since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation,cooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime. Our mostimportant objective must be to put an end to the plague ofcollaboration. To do so, we abduct collaborators, intimidate andinterrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and exposethe methods that the enemy uses to lure Palestinians intocollaboration in the first place. In addition to that, naturally,we confront the problem of collaborators by executing them.     We don't execute every collaborator. After all, about 70percent of them are innocent victims, tricked or black-mailed intotheir misdeeds. The decision whether to execute a collaborator isbased on the seriousness of his crimes. If, like manycollaborators, he has been recruited as an agent of the IsraeliBorder Guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once.He's as dangerous as an Israeli soldier, so we treat him like anIsraeli soldier.     There's another group of collaborators who perform an evenmore loathsome role -- the ones who help the enemy trap young menand women in blackmail schemes that force them to becomecollaborators. I regard the "isqat" [the process by which aPalestinians is blackmailed into collaboration] of single person asgreater crime than the killing of a demonstrator. If someone isguilty of causing repeated cases of isqat, than it is our religiousduty to execute him.     A third group of collaborators is responsible for thedistribution of narcotics. They work on direct orders from theSecurity Services to distribute drugs as widely as possible. Theirvictims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit andimpossible to afford more. They collaborate in order to get thedrugs they crave. The dealers must also be executed.     In the battalions, we have developed a very careful method ofuncovering collaborators, We can't afford to abduct an innocentperson, because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnishedforever. We will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only afterevidence of his guilt has been established -- never before. Ifafter interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond anydoubt, then he is executed.     In many cases, we don't have to make our evidence againstcollaborators public, because everyone knows that they're guilty.But when the public isn't aware that a certain individual is acollaborator, and we accuse him, people are bound to ask forevidence. Many people will proclaim his innocence, so there must beirrefutable proof before he is executed. This proof is usuallyobtained in the form of a confession.     At first, every collaborator denies his crimes. So we startoff by showing the collaborator the testimony against him. We tellhim that he still has a chance to serve his people, even in thelast moment of his life, by confessing and giving us theinformation we need.     We say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he hasbeen a victim. That kind of talk is convincing. Most of themconfess after that. Others hold out; in those cases, we applypressure, both psychological and physical. Then the holdoutsconfess as well.     Only one collaborator has ever been executed without aninterrogation. In that case, the collaborator had been seen workingfor the Border Guard since before the intifada, and he himselfconfessed his involvement to a friend, who disclosed theinformation to us. In addition, three members of his network ofcollaborators told us that he had caused their isqat. With thismuch evidence, there was no need to interrogate him. But we arevery careful to avoid wrongful executions. In every case, ourprincipal is the same: the accused should be interrogated until hehimself confesses his crimes.      A few weeks ago, we sat down and complied a list ofcollaborators to decide whether there were any who could beexecuted without interrogation. An although we had hundreds ofnames, still, because of our fear of God and of hell, we could notmark any of these men, except for the one I just mentioned, forexecution.     When we execute a collaborator in public, we use a gun. Butafter we abduct and interrogate a collaborator, we can't shoot him-- to do so might give away our locations. That's why collaboratorsare strangled. Sometimes we ask the collaborator, "What do youthink? How should we execute you?" One collaborator told us,"Strangle me." He hated the sight of blood.-----Naftaly Stramer  | Intergraph ElectronicsInternet: nstramer@dazixco.ingr.com      | 6101 Lookout Road, Suite A    Voice: (303)581-2370  FAX: (303)581-9972 | Boulder, CO 80301"Quality is everybody's job, and it's everybody's job to watch all that they can."

Let's put it this way: If Israel has put people away withoutpublicizing their arrests or the legal proceedings against them, howhas their disappearance been explained?  People have relatives,friends and colleagues, you know.  Israel is not known as a placewhere people are made to vanish.  Would you care to give us a list ofpeople whose whereabouts are unknown?

This a "tried and true" method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups:to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace, thus forcing theopposing "state" to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or,in order to avoid the deaths of civilians, abandon the search. Certainly thepeople who use the population for cover are *also* to blaim for dragging theinnocent civilians into harm's way.Are you suggesting that, when guerillas use the population for cover, Israelshould totally back down?

Your damn right Israel insists on some sort of "demilitarized" or "buffer"zone. Its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territoryof Arab states and watched as the states did nothing. It is not exactlysurprizing that Israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to do it themselves.>If Israel is interested in peace, than it should withdraw from OUR land.  What? So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states can start all over again? While I also hope for this to happen, it willonly occur WHEN Arab states show that they are *prepared* to take on the responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their soil. They have to Prove it (or provide some "guaratees"), there is no wayIsrael is going to accept their "word"- not with their past attitude of tolerance towards "anti-Israel guerillas in-residence".>>I have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only>real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace>settlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and>peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure>no one on either side of the border is shelled.Good lord, Brad. What in the world goves you the idea that UN troops stopanything? They are ONLY stationed in a country because that country allowsthem in. It can ask them to leave *at any time*; as Nasser did in '56 and'67. Somehow, with that "limitation" on the troops "powers" I don'tthink that Israel is going to be any more comfortable. Without a *genuine* commitment to peace from the Arab states, and concrete (not intellectual or political exercises in jargon) "guarantees" by other parties, the UN is worthlessto Israel (but, perhaps useful as a "ruse"?).>This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to>realize that the concept of a "buffer zone" aimed at protecting>its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more>Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel>would have resulted in.  Perhaps you are aware that, to most communities of people, there isthe feeling that it is better that "many of us die fightingagainst those who attack us than for few to die while we silently accept our fate." If,however, you call on Israel to see the sense of suffering fewer casualties, I suggest you apply the same to Palestinian,Arab and Islamic groups.>If Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw >unilaterally from the so-called "Security Zone" before the conclusion>of the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives,>advance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel's >public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations >since Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in >peace and has already offered some important concessions.>Along with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah>be disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not >accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a>shelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone>and will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it.From Israel's perspective, "concessions" gets it NOTHING...except the realization that it has given "something" up and now *can only hope* that the other side decides to do likewise. Words *can be takenback* by merely doing so; to "take back" tangible items (land,control of land) requires the sort of action you say Israel shouldstay away from. Israel put up with attacks from Arab state territories for decades before essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of Lebanon.The entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above: 1) Israel would express outrage at these attacks and protest to the Arab state involved, 2) that state promptly ignored the entire matter, secure in the knowledge that IT could not be held responsible for the acts committed by "private groups", 3) Israel would prepare for the next round of attacks. What would Israel want to return to those days (anddon't be so idiotic as to suggest "trust" for the motivations ofpresent-day Arab states)?>There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese>goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such >circumstances, >Ah, ok...what is "different" about the present situation that tellsus that the Arab states will *not* pursue their past antagonistic policies towards Israel? Now, don't talk about vague "political factors"but about those "tangible" (just like that which Israel gave up)factors that "guarantee" the responsibility of those states. Yourassessment of "difference" here is based on a whole lot of assumptions,and most states don't feel confortable basing their existence on thatsort of thing.>and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is>capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did>in all other parts of Lebanon.>>BasilIt has not. Without the support, and active involvement, of Syria,Lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred.Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain control? If Syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for Israel.>  TimYour view of this entire matter is far too serenely one-sided andselectively naive.

When the Arabs lost, Israel was left witha bunch of people who has just tried to kill them who now wanted backinto the country as citizens.  What would you have done?  Let them in sothey could kill Jews?  Israel sees those Arabs who stayed as citizens because they were loyal to Israel during the war and didn't leave.  Ofcourse some Arabs could have left to avoid the fighting but distinguishingbetween the two is impossible.  Therefore a decision was made based onsecuturity of the country.>8.

Although the major parties in Israel aren't religious (however not totally secular),due to the format of the government (coalition) the religious parties havealways had a lot of pull since they were needed to form a majority coalition.In fact, from what I heard the present government is the least influencedby the religious parties in the existance of Israel.  Israel CANNOT becalled a secular state.  For instace, Haifa is the only city in the country(except for maybe some Arab cities) where buses run on the Jewish Sabbath.  There are many other examples of religion in Israel.  Marriages in Israelare NOT contolled by the state, but by Rabbis and Priests.

It is to thosewho read with open mind, that I address myself.%The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of%Racial Discrimination adopted by the General Assembly of the%United Nations in 1965, has now been ratified by most member%states. Article 1 of this Convention defines the term racial%discrimination as "any distinction, exclusion, restriction or%preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic%origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing%the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of%human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic,%social, cultural or any other field of public life."While the ideals embodied in this text are worthy goals,as the text currently stands I know of no country in whichracial discrimination of some sort can not be found.It makes no mention of the need for for a legislativeviolation.%The General Assembly endorsed in 1975 a resolution defining%Zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimination. The%important, correct and legitimate resolution is incomplete since%it does not include operative statements designed to end Israeli%racial discrimination. Meanwhile the United States, on behalf of%Israel, are exerting heavy pressure on member states of the United%Nations to repeal this resolution and give Israeli racial%practices - Zionism - moral legitimacy.If you are, in principle, advocating UN intervention via operativestatements in this case, it must therefore hold that they can beapplied to any other case where the council perceives some formof racial discrimination as previously exhibited.Scarey thought.%The very definition of Israel as a State belonging to the Jews of%the world (but not to its inhabitants), alienates all native%non-Jews born in that country. Actually, I know quite a few native non-Jews born in Israel that are notalienated by this law.  If you had said some, you would probably becorrect, however your tendency to exagerate and slant facts becomesapparent.  This slant permeates the text.%Practically all non-Jews who are living in or originate from areas%under Israeli control, identify themselves as Palestinians. Most%of them are Muslim, many are Christian. A few Jews, including the%author of these lines, also identify themselves as Palestinians.The above statement is not true.  Practically all - discountingBeduins, Circassians, Druze, and some other fringe groups.Your own identification is a matter that has no bearing upon theissue.  You could equally identify yourself as a [insert group].%Zionism took off in Europe at the end of last century. It's aim%was to create a Jewish state in Palestine in spite of the adamant%opposition of Palestinian Arabs (95% of the population).If I recall correctly, at the time "zionism" took off, therewas no adamant opposition in Palestine.  I am open to anyfactual contradictory evidence .%But the%Zionists were more powerful, militarily, economically and%technologically, and succeeded in 1948 in conquering 70% of the%area of Mandatory Palestine. After driving into exile most native%Arabs from the conquered areas, approximately 750,000 people, and%razing most of their villages to the ground, the Zionists could%finally establish a predominantly Jewish State. Only 150,000%non-Jews remained on Israeli territory.Do you therefore contend that the 400 villages you mention further on "mostof their villages"?%Once the Jewish State was established, it began enacting laws to%help the confiscation of land from native non-Jews, their%political repression and their destitution.There is no doubt that laws passed provided a framework which was laterused for these purposes.  However, you seem to imply that this was theintention a priori, which implies a policy and agenda.  My knowledge wasthat this was not the case.You also neglect to mention the circumstances that surroundedthis.  As you do again, below.%In 1967 the State of Israel invaded Egypt and Syria and occupied%the rest of Palestine (the West Bank and the Gaza strip). Thus%another 1.5 million Palestinians fell under its juridiction. Its%occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories is considered%illegal by the international community, as reflected in Security%Council resolutions. Israel has rejected all U.N. resolutions and%began without delay to entrench its occupation and rule over these%territories with the aim of annexing them at the appropriate time.Not quite accurate.  Israel has not rejected all the resolutions,though it has conflicting understanding with regards to some of them.Israel never annexed the Sinai, West Bank, or Gaza.  The otherannexations were brought about partly due to the UN resolutions.%Part of these territores, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights,%have already been forcefully annexed by Israel, in defiance of%international law and UN resolutions.Out of curiousity, provided that the annexees are granted citizenship,what int'l law do you claim prohibits annexation of territoriescaptured in war?  Has this ever been applied to any other countrypreviously (other than Iraq) ?%It must be emphasized that, although these people live under%different regimes, they are united in their self-perception as%Palestinians, that is as people identifying with Palestine, a%territorial entity (not an ethnic or religious entity).Incorrect! Palestinians themselves claim to be discriminated againston an "ethnic or racial" basis.  Therefore your above statement isincorrect.I also note that given the previous definition of racial discrimination,the only means that you could argue for that is nationalistically.However, no such nation has existed.  It definitely did not existat the time of the creation of Israel, in which case you can notargue racial discrimination during that period!%Furthermore Palestinians generally consider the PLO both as a%symbol of national identity and as the unchallenged authority that%represents them in world affairs.Once again, some do, some don't.%The non-Jewish population living in the Palestinian and other Arab%territories occupied by Israel in 1967 suffers not only blatant%discrimination but is subject to brutal military occupation.Another generalization, but then again, you don't seem to careabout anyone other than the Palestinian people, whose cause youespouse.%licence, to start a business and to buy industrial equipment, the%right to educate children, all of these basic rights are subject%to arbitrary rulings by military authorities and cannot be%challenged in court.Incorrect once again.  They have the ability to appeal.Furthermore, although you may not agree with them, not allof the military rulings are senseless or arbitrary.  Someare, but this is not due to the "whims" of the military asmuch as the sizeof the task/organization.%Only Jewish inhabitants of the occupied%territories are permitted to carry firearms.Incorrect once again.  I know two Arab policemen who lived inDaheisha and there were more.  Of course, with the outbreak ofthe intifada they were forced by the locals to resign, bitterly.%Jewish settlers have%right to 6-7 more water per person than non-Jews. Jewish residents%of these territories number now about 100,000 people. It is Israel%governmentUs policy to increase this number substantially, in%total defiance of international law, UN resolutions and the will%of the population. The State of Israel systematically confiscates%land from non-Jewish inhabitants of these territories for Jewish%settlement.That is no longer true, and I can't help but wonder what yourpurpose is/was in posting this.%Some 800,000 people in Israel proper,are not Jews. Most of them%consider themselves Palestinians with Israeli citizenship. For%many years after the establishment of Israel they were subjected%to harsh military control. Much of their land was confiscated by%the State and handed to Jewish organisations for exclusive Jewish%settlement. They have been subject to massacres, destitution and%humiliation. While they enjoy, with Jewish Israelis, the right to%vote, they are discriminated against both through law and in%practice.Once again, to hell with the other minorities that don't fit in,right?  Their are many villages who did not suffer in the wayyou seem to indicate, Abu Gosh comes to mind.  Yes, some did butas a result of what actions?%Approximately 92% of the surface of the State of Israel within the%Rgreen lineS is for all purposes closed to Palestinians who are%second-class citizens in Israel. They may neither legally live on%such land, nor rent or cultivate it. A direct effect of these%policies is that native non-Jewish citizens of Israel are denied%residence and membership rights in most rural communities in%Israel, including the collective settlements, kibbutzim. Non-Jews%are discriminated against in many other ways: The Government%starves local authorities of Palestinian villages and townships of%funds; Jewish city councils force Palestinians to live in ghettos;%Jewish families receive higher child allocations than their%non-Jewish neighbors, Palestinian schools suffer underfunding and%understaffing (as compared to Jewish schools); Palestinian%children are denied the right to learn their history and%literature; Israelis who struggle for equal rights and for the end%of racial discrimination, suffer continuous harassment by the%authorities.1.  There are some kibbutzim with Arab/Non-Jewish members.    It is up to the members of the kibbutz.  There is no    legislation against it, nor against a purely non-Jewish    collective.2.  Funds are the result of political lobbying.  Bearing in mind    that non_Jews compose ~20% of the voting population, it has    never failed to amaze me that they fail to form one large    bloc, and increase their power.  The recent elections are a case     in point.3.  Please provide factual evidence supporting your allegation    with regard to educational material.  You have obviously    never seen the curriculum of a school in the West Bank.    It is based upon Jordan's school system.4.  With regard to your last statement, it is simply another    gross generalization.  %The State of Israel refuses to acknowledge itself as the State of%all its inhabitants.  Although the Israeli Cabinet has never%openly endorsed the 'transfer' idea (the forced removal from the%country of its native Palestinian population, that is, its%ultimate Judaization), Israeli government policies towards%non-Jews bear the mark of this 'Final Solution'. No attempt is%made by the Zionist authorities to integrate Palestinian Arabs%into Israeli public life. Thus, although comprising approximately%17% of the population of Israeli citizens, no Palestinian citizen%of Israel has ever served as Cabinet member, as director of %ministry or of a national institution, as judge of the Supreme%Court, as ambassador of Israel, or in any leading position in%Israeli economic or financial life. Even the director of the%Ministry for Arab Affairs - yes, such a thing exists! - is a Jew.Another generalization, but lets not stop here.The transfer idea was espoused by one party in the last gov't,Moledet.  It was intended to be a solution to the problem in theterritories, not the country itself.  With regard to other items,I recall at least one Arab ambassador, and the rest was coveredpreviously.%Although sexual%relations between and cohabitation of Jews and non-Jews are legal,%they are considered by Israeli/Zionist society somewhat a betrayal%of the Jewish and Zionist ethics. The Israeli educational system%nurtures this attitude in a systematic way.When was the last time you were in Israel?  That is simply not true,nor has it been for quite some time.  The question of religiousintervention is best answered by the proportional representation andthe lack of any Arab party bloc to counter the orthodox one.%Zionism rejects the idea of a modern secular state, based on%equality of all citizens. This is one main reason why Israel has%not produced any written Constitution. Simply incorrect.The answer is political.  Once again, your failure to understand thedynamics and movements inside Israeli gov't, relegates yourcontentions to the sidelines.%Zionism predicates a state%where Jews have privileged rights. Thus, according to Israeli law,%a Jew born in London, who has never visited Israel, does not speak%Hebrew and professes atheism, is granted automatic Israeli%citizenship, while native Palestinian inhabitants who happen to be%Christian or Muslim, are treated almost as aliens.  Racial%discrimination, as defined in international law, is thus not only%reflected in Israeli laws and policies, but is grounded in the%very nature of Israel as a Jewish state.But the discrimination is not based upon race.Oops, sorry, nasty habit I have of countering malicious false truths.%Any proposal for Israeli-Arab and Israeli-Palestinian peace that%does not address the issue of racial discrimination by Israel -%that is the Zionist nature of the State of Israel - is thus doomed%to fail.Real world intrusion - any proposal that does is doomed to fail.Of course, I wouldn't expect you to understand, wrapped up asyou are in your VIEW of things.

Center for Regional StudiesDate: Fri, 14 May 1993 02:04:18 GMTLines: 53 May 13, 1993  _Five Russian soldiers sentenced to death in Azerbaijan_ MOSCOW (UPI) -- Five soldiers who served in Russia's 7th army stationed inArmenia were sentenced to death in the Azerbaijani capital Baku Thursday forallegedly "carrying out diversions and killing 30 Azeri soldiers." A statement released by the news service of Azeri President Abulfaz Elchibeysaid "the sentence was final and was not subject to protest or appeal," the Russian state news agency Itar-tass reported. But the Russian Foreign Ministry issued an appeal for the men to be handedover to the authorities in Moscow for punishment. "This would accord with modern standards of humanity towards those who havecommitted crimes," the statement reads. The five men, together with another soldier who received a 15-year prisonsentence, were captured in September 1992 by Azeri police in the Kelbadzhardistrict of Azerbaijan, between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. The Supreme Court in Baku said the men had gone through special training in acompany of the Russian 7th army in the Armenian capital Yerevan, after whichthey were sent across the Armenian-Azeri border into Nagorno-Karabakh to carry out diversions against Azeri troops. However, the Russian Foreign Ministry statement claimed they had deserted theRussian army and were fighting as mercenaries with Armenian armed forces inthe battle zone round Karabakh. Nagorno-Karabakh is an Armenian-populated enclave within Azerbaijan which forfive years has been fighting for independence from Baku in a war that hasleft many thousands dead and uprooted hundreds of thousands from their homes. Both Yerevan and Baku have always claimed that Russian servicemen stationedin these Caucasian republics, who were left behind after the break-up of the Soviet Union, are fighting as mercenaries in the Karabakh war. The statement from Moscow said the Russian side repeatedly appealed to theAzerbaijani government to show humanity and leniency in their treatment of thesix men, and to hand them over to the Russian authorities. It said that President Boris Yeltsin himself sent a letter with this request to his Azeri counterpart Elchibey. Itar-tass said that the soldiers' defenseattorneys had lodged an appeal for clemency.   -- David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | "Armenia has not learned a lesson inS.D.P.A.

The former is used on passports|> etc, and the later for daily identification in Israeli society. I|> am told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at all|> times and present them at many public places, almost every day.|> These ID cards make clear who the holder is, a Jew or an Arab.|> You maintain that this mainly because of religious services|> provided. But do you really believe that this is the reason ?|> Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it|> serves no other purpose ?A number of points.  You are making assumptions about the mannerin which the cards are used.  True, by law, all residents, citizens,and tourists must carry a form of identification with them.  Forcitizens, the standard ID is the ID card.  The purpose this serveson a daily basis, wherein they are presented at public places,is for the purpose of identifying the bearer.  This takes placein banks (cashing checks), post offices (registered mail and such), etc...Quite frankly, it was rare that I ever had to present my ID cardfor such activities more than once per week.  There is no law orrequirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public.Furthermore, none of the services I outlined discriminate againstthe bearer in any manner by having access to this information.The only case that I can think of in which the Le'um field mightbe taken into account is during interaction with the police,based upon the scenario.  In general though, arab citizens areclearly recognizable, as are non-arabs. Your argument thereforebecomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this fieldis being used to discriminate against them officially.|> In the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that|> Israel has no fixed borders, you state that Israel's borders were|> 'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace'. According to what I|> read, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had|> plans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into|> Transjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish of|> Ben-Gurion to not declare Israel's borders, when Israel was|> established, as this might restrict Israel's opportunities for|> later expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the|> fact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the|> land to them. But according to biblical sources, the area God|> promised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the|> borders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use|> today ?  Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can't it declare what|> it considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a|> base for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, one|> cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a|> number of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).I take issue with your assertions.  I think that Arab countriesdo know that they have nothing to fear from "Israeli expansionism".Militarily, Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts ofland under occupation to a hostile, armed, and insurgent population for asustained period of time.  As is, the intifada is heavily taxingthe Israeli economy.  Proof of this can be seen in the Israeliwithdrawal from Lebanon.  Israeli troops pulled back from theAwali, and later from the Litani, in order to control the minimalstrip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire.Public opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifadavia territorial concessions.  The Israel public is sufferring frombattle fatigue of sorts and the gov't is aware of it.With regards to borders, let me state the following.  I may not agreewith the manner in which negotiations are being held, however the cruxof the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from statinga starting position.  The arab parties have called for total withdrawaland a return to pre-48 borders.  If Israel were to state large borders,the negotiations might never get under way.  If Israel were to statesmaller borders, then the arab countries might try and force even smallerborders during the negotiations.  I think that leaving the matter to besettled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realisticand sensible.|> Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public|> official. I don't think your answer is honest.  You refer me to|> Vanunu's revelations about Israel's nuclear arsenal without|> evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said|> the truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why|> should he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty.Your statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a "center forpolicy research".  Whether or not all of Vanunu's revelations were true has nobearing on the fact that some were.  For disclosing "state secrets"after having signed contracts and forms with the understanding thatsaid secrets are not to be made public, one should be punished.As to which were and which weren't, I am under no moral obligationto disclose that - quite the reverse in fact.He was taken to court, tried, and found guilty.  You may take issuewith a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of theconcept of "Secrets of state", something which every democratic govthas.|> Somebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning|> 'hidden prisoners' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from|> Ma'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do|> exist in Israel. What do you think about that ?I noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could existmore than he documented the fact that they do exist.  The CLU noted,which you evidently did not pay attention to, that they know of no suchreports or cases.  I am sorry to tell you but in a country of 4 mill,as tightly knit as Israel, even if the matter of the arrest was notmade public, within a relatively short time frame, most people would knowabout it.  My own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should bemade public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of X hours.This would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that anannouncement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation.|> You imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a|> way to 'cast aspersions upon Israel'. Such terms have often been|> used by the Soviet Union against dissidents: They call the Soviet|> Union into disrepute.

This is a sign of weakness, not of strength.Well, I am sorry to say that your questions are slanted.  Suchquestions are often termed "tabloid journalism" and are notdisturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity.Such questions were often used during the McCarthy era asa basis for the witch-hunts that took place then.  To useyour own example, these questions might have been liftedfrom the format used by Stalinist prosecutors that were lookingfor small bits of evidence that they could distort and portrayas a larger and dirtier picture.My answers were not any more "hysterical" than the questionsthemselves.  The problem is not that the q's were provocative,it was that they were selective in their fact seeking.  Youfall into the same category of those who seek "yes" "no" answerswhen the real answer is "of sorts".I suspect that as long as the answers to these questions is not anunequivocal NO, you would remain unsatified and choose to interpretethem as you see fit.  A sign of strength is the ability to lookYou remind me of those mistaken environmentalists who once advocatedculling wolves because of the cruelty to deer, only to find that theyhad broken the food chain and wreaked havoc upon the very environmentthey sought to protect.

These criteria are to be found for example in the1.  International Convention for Abolition of All Forms of Racial    Discrimination (ratified by most countries)2.   The International Covenant of Political and Civil Rights3.   The Human Rights Charter4.   The European Convention of Human RightsIf one reads carefully how racial discrimination is defined in theselegally binding instruments, and does not resort to sophistry, it isobvious that the State of Israel is guilty of racial discrimination.The people suffering the most extreme form of racial discriminatnionby the Zionist regime are the Palestinian refugees, some of whom liveunder Israeli military control and others who live in the diaspora.They are not entitled to return to their homeland for the solereason that they are not Jews. International law does not include anyprovisions which permits such denial of rights, under any circumstance.Israel's actions of denial are totally illegal and immoral. By allowingthe return of the refugees and permitting them to settle in Tel in any area  ofthe State of Israel, the State would finally gain its legitimaty underinternational law and could be justified in asking to be recognized.

The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians 78 years ago in x-Soviet Armenia is being reenacted again - this time in Azerbaijan. There are remarkable similarities between the plots, the perpetrators, and the underdogs. The stories of survivors of Karabag massacre:69 year old Hatin Nine telling:-''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. They toldme: We won't kill you. But the babies have to die in front of your eyes.''72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu:- ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours.  While killing children and babies mercilessly they said: You are  Turks, you must die.''28 year old Gulsum Huseyin:- ''They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of    my eyes.''Are these stories lies? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming?Were these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region?The nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of BritishJournalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Timesarticle. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even beforeTurkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Picturesof people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off.Even the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these "lies." They are saying"exaggeration." That means ''somethings'' have happened but thesituation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalutown was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach...The massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects ofthis massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word.Some of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, abilityto ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre.Yesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's printno news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were theFrench TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabagwas ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.''The age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lotsof organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Securityand Cooperation in Europe), and rules, all designed to fight against humanrights violations. International reactions must be made with internationalcooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claimingto be civilized.Could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of theright to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Whereis the cooperation? Where are the reactions? And the intellectuals,journalists, writers, TV stations of certain western countries suchas France who are fast to claim leadership of "human rights?"Where are you?Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

I cannotaccept and will not accept threats to my personal integrity and Iurge anybody who opposes terror to refrain from direct or indriectthreats.PS: My proposal has nothing to do with Nazi eugenics. It has to do withthe search for peace which would enable justice. I don't consider thatjustice is done, when non-Jews who fled or were expelled in 1948/1967are not permitted to return to their homeland. This can at best be calledpragmatism, a nice word for legitimizing the rule of the strong. It cannever be called justice. And peace without justice will never be peace.It is my conviction that the situation in which a state, through thelaw, attempts to discourage mixed marriages (as Israel does), is notnormal. Such a state resembles more Nazi Germany and South Africa thanWestern democracies, such as the United States, in which Jews are free tomarry whom they wish and do so in the thousands. My proposal may havedrawbacks but it is meant to force anybody to anything, just tocompensate for a certain time mixed couples for the hardships tehyendure in a society which disapproves of intermarriage.When the daywill come and Israel will become a truly civil and decmoractic society,in which the state is not concerned with the religious or ethnicaffiliation of its constituency, such a Fund would not be needed anymore. I don't mind if Jews wish to marry Jews and keep theirtraditions, why not ? But this is not the affairs of a state. Westerndemocracy clearly separates these domains and I am certain thatmostAmerican Jews enjoy this fact and would not love to live in a state termedChristian State and to have their Green cards stamped with a mark JEW.I would ask those who are genuinely interested in an exchange of viewsand personal experiencces to refrain from emotional, infantileoutbursts which might leed readers to infer that Jews who respectJudaism are uncivilized. Such behaviour is not good for Judaism.Elias

The suffering that they areLet us not forget about the genocide of the Azeri people in 'Karabag' and x-Soviet Armenia by the Armenians. Between 1914 and 1920, Armenians committed unheard-of crimes, resorted to all conceivable methods of despotism, organized massacres, poured petrol over babies and burned them, raped women and girls in front of their parents who were bound hand and foot, took girls from their mothers and fathers and appropriated personal property and real estate. And today, they put Azeris in the most unbearable conditions any other nation had ever known in history.                               AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  theCaspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches inhis trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town ofHojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope."I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,"the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  theHojali disaster. "I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky tobe alive."Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricityfor more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on theedge of Karabakh."At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heardbefore,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavymachine-guns, the lot," Mr Sadikov said.Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the directionof  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  startedfleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through thesnow into a forest on the other side.To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdamabout 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it,until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the twoArmenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak."None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted bya  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started openingfire," Mr Sadikov said.Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forwardto force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their effortswere mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from hisgroup of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiamanson.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his67-year-old elder brother."I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,"he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. "Wehave never got any of the bodies back."The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as hestruggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group'scrossing, Mr Sadikov said.Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he andseveral others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushyhillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep threeArmenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there waslittle comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population wassoon to flee."The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenianrocket attack. Some people just  kept going," Mr Sadikov said. "Ihad to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way.They even found a bullet in my sock."Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in theHojali massacre in February  (left).

[1]Born 1964Secretary-TypistAzsantekmontazh TrustSumgait Construction and Installation AdministrationSecretary of the SMU Komsomol OrganizationResident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15Microdistrict No. 3Sumgait [Azerbaijan]On the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o'clock show,at the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards away. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, "The Abyss." Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at the City Party Committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation whatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it was about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if someone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. We bought our tickets. There were 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that large movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped thefilm. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an Armenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do to Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded a girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move over, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina. It got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it'sonly opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats. Everyone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis, people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the auditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and gradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, "OK, we've scared them enough, let's leave." They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to me that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of "anasha", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like they were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing had happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We could barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine, and it was dark . . .Marina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that's the center of town. LeninStreet was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting, something about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especially listening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation wasn't running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police, policemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at thedoors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors there are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief-stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well, since he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super serious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we live literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot, not because it wasdark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the driver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well, OK . . .So we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was happening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation was at a standstill and everyone was shouting "Ka-ra-bagh," they're not going to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there'simmediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had come, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . Somehow we managed to cheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway,just what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma down. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though nothing had happened.That was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn't go anywhere and didn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on.That day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn'tguess.On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we alwayshad. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda, Marina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that morning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting athome and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda Zimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we didour apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that somethingawful was happening in town. I asked, "Don't they want Armenians? Well what are they after, if they're already in that state?" She says, no, nothing like that, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feelslike a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The cabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy problems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera,asked him, "Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things goingon in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?" Papa didn't know what shewas talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home and told Mamma. Mamma said, "Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it meansthat something is really going on." But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian,she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I tell Lyuda, "Ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, I'll see you out." Mamma says, "You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can see what the situation in town is." So we decided to stay home. Dinner was ready. Mamma says, "Let her eat with us, then she can go." We sat down at the table. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating.We turned on the television, and the show "In Fairy-Tale Land" was coming on. We cleared the table.We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't see what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the busstation, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people . . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, lookingsomewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's an Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go downto look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20 people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decidethat means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their feet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak. . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . .If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from himand started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if hegot up and left or not.I become terrified and go home and say, "Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at ourplace, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . " Then the crowd runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors are also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it turns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and kept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop them.They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows,afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the windows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard, and it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't crush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a hugecloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey Sargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous din and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were shouting Father's name, "Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!," orsomething like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma says, "Into the bedroom, quickly!" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part of our dowry; Mamma says, "Hide there, they probably won't come in there, they'll ask something, say something, and leave." She says, "We'll tell them that we live alone here." I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say that I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak Azerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina andLyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told her anything or not.Then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fellright into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here,leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. Itell them, "What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, whathas happened." In Azerbaijani, they say, "Get out of the apartment, leave." I say, "OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the apartment." I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights withthem, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in thedoorway, the young guys, say, "There are old people and one girl with them.Too bad!" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I havepacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts, commanding them: "Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?"And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into oneroom, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start undressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there, in front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body,and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among themselves who would go first.Later, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comesin, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding. He looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everythingdepends on him. He looks and says, "Well, we're done here." They are beatingMamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs . . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . wasout cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the windows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking about being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, thatI'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be, which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they don't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I humble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since mytongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing . . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't know if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by my arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings, something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someoneelse is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death come? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me nearthe entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What happened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember. I come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me clothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember that I said the same words over and over again: "Mamma, what happened, Mamma, what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?" I can't make sense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, heserved in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all went to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though he's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he served in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also servedthere, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor brought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying, "Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them." How do I know who's who and what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. ThenPapa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda said that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching theRussians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going to tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's hands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding on the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in there. So they survived.My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things.While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back up again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed there. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, theone whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and knocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, "I'm not going to let you in the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockings and we'll leave the building." Lyuda says, "I'll stay at your place because ofwhat's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs." It was just for a moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda came back to our place and lay under the bed . . .I came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephone number, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he came to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we were simply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passedbetween life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct.There they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly, it was hard to breathe . . .My supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of our administration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great numberof buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary passenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right after eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, andwhat was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not only in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next, without stopping. After us.I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were fromBuildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman diedfrom Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There young Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building. Incidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relativesto warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in Microdistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, "Runquickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stayalive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away." At that moment three people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in suchawful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up, there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my facewas pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get mynormal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you here, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of the soldiers said, "Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from the Sumgait police. They called in from Daghestan." So at that point the Daghestan police were there.When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there,there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know,maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously injured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what they were there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda and me and said, "These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't know what to do with the rest."So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My boss said, "Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matterwhat happens." We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a departmenthead from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She examined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait ambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that somethingvery good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself, "God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?" She looks me over and says, "Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have beendoing, your people did even worse things." And I think, great, I have to deal with her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not tohave to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this condition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't have the energy to say, "How could our people possibly be smart enough to think of something that yours haven't already done?" I stayed there. Then theybrought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her own apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next morning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. Thiswas in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything more than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer, nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at them.I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur-pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. Thatsame evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my facewas disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, "Better to ask your brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can better explain what happened." She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into myward.Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me clothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress, but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up above my knees, and the woman orderly said, "I can't believe you put on such ashort dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?" I went back to my ward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and brought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I couldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I saidthat I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one had to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . . Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an Armenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something else would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside onthe street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night.The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus, and off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me tothe club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening.I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw a few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought that I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait after that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine. I didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm me down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw a lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each other and asking, "What happened, what went on?" Two days later they came to see me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed interest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they could. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions, neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what happened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart . . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came, not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part of, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangementswith the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down bymyself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with mylungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be from all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular.When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful. There was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were emergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's friends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic. They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what Ineeded at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficultybreathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me.They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard somepeople saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being allbandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But Iwasn't cut.They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon appeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not talk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, "We demand that Seidov come!" The response was, "It's Seidov who sent us." Seidov is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said, "We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you agitators." And so on. More of them said, "Have Seidov himself come." This went on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us out of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because they realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The smell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who had literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a club that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay to eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day someone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill.Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie theater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it was impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants took ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in Yerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting right and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women were in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come any minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie theater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to the attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and couldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently they caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn thetheater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my eyes.Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, "Aren't you an Azerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani." Theyled out all the men and started letting them back in by checking theirpassports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people didnot have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not likethey should have, with their IDs.So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. OnMonday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed,they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered the Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter-in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only the two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself, she ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the building until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children. This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were already in the city.They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire families. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armeniansor not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't see any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult now to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused ingasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard that many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people, including a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived inMicrodistrict 3.They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were going home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply savagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that hoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armeniansout and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that theyput them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from the corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, IraG., if I'm not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and she still can't figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and carried her to the city. I still can't imagine how he managed to do that.I heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of people went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a song in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song, the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They couldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment andcalled the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me,she couldn't remember anyone's face.I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had talked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knockedout of my head. I can't remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I sawthe Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization, where Marina works. Shegoes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day atthe Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I'm the Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint meetings. I know them all, I've even talked with them, and he, I know, is fromArmenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.They took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to theProcuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden-tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. Theyshowed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on ourcase, but I can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they werethe ones, they're processing it somehow. They tell me that they know thatsomeone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were dragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these people, all of them, as much as I've heard about them and seen them, they wereall from Kafan.The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was there when everything started. It must have been him because I didn't recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more sinceI told him, "Listen, you do something, because you know me." He turned away and went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn't see Marina anyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out anyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became myself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people there. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his name. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one we're part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, "Ifhe's here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I'm crazy, not responsible for my words." He said, "What did they do to you, how awful, myself, I hid an Armenian family." Then after some time goes by he comes back again and says something entirely different: "I wasn't at home, my family and I went to Baku." I said, "Marina, what is he saying? He said something totallydifferent before." After that I didn't go to see our Procurator, our case is being handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me that Rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved. What are they doing with Rzayev?Did he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the head I can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an insult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the same timeI'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat-ter who I name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that onewasn't there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did whatexactly I can't say.                                                     When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn't see it, because I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always gotit because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed, they took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, heworks at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41, is where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ dormitory is over there, that's where he lives. Now he's in custody, they evenhave proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, theclarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our building was killed, it was that man.A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw thathe was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was all over, people started making announcements in town saying that investigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now they've caught him, everything's been proved. Now, evidently, they've beenbeating him, I don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy came to the plant and said, "Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the bus station on Saturday at ten." That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to,went. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Fridaynight. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do you mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent, probably, in their hearts they were thinking, I'm going to go. But they didn'tsay anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go, because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had killed their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of that. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             fromI've participated in the investigation a couple of times. I'm satisfied withthem thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word I said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an Armenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don't know. His last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from Microdistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time. His mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani KGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many photographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at curfew, and I've got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this, the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat offand burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he is so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don't know what he did, I can't remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment. At the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this, all this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. I took a lookat him and thought, "My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like you." But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything without great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when she came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled overthe table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on thebalcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters. They stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the faces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the apartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and no place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have anywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the apartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the apartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That's what they said. How did they know there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking thatArmenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the building, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis lived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn't set fire to our apartment.I don't know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt when I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I wouldhave said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . butprobably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and sawthat all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like ata free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians werebeing fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would havebeen fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from our building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, "Karina, we saw all of it, how could it happen?" They're asking me! Well I just don't knowwhat to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to me. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been able to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani woman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two Armenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on thebalcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She came down to the entryway and said, "You'll come in this entryway over my deadbody." So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't even know what they were doing. I don't think that's true. They knew very wellwhat they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. They couldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani stopped them.They were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place they were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the apartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that? Maybe I'm losing my mind? But no, they're all chewing something. Maybe it is some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had come to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. Theydidn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They screamed and screamed: "Yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the Armenians!" Only they didn't shout "kill," they shouted "gurun ermianlary." Gurun literally means "kill," or "destroy."That's how it was! I'll continue. We hid in a captain's apartment, he's anAzerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their kids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part of the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn't findLyuda she took Papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things,but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparentlythey had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found thecourage to . . .A boy said to my mother "Where's the gold?" Mamma said he must have been 12 to 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the fair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where the gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a little black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn't really like to wear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were bought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mammathinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and Mamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth, bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and tore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted to open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake, "What's happened?" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, "At least go and find out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or murdered them, at least bring the corpses." He went looking for us. At that moment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that someone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn't get out from under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from under the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had losther mind. I'll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that way to me, I'll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled down, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in fromoutside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don't remember what order ithappened in.And Mamma said, "Listen, they're all running around down there, shouting something or other, and running toward the other building." It had more or less calmed down where we were. Who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. I tried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, "Listen;let's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don't know how long we'll be here. Maybe they didn't burn everything." I don't get it, allwomen have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe not everything was taken? I tell Mamma, "Mamma, what do you need any of that for? To hell with it! We're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!" Shesays, "No, let's go get at least something. Maybe we'll leave here, spend the night at someone else's." Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their sonAlik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were coming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He shouts, "Come back, they're coming!" They didn't have enough time to get a lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my knitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore,out of the hall . . . Someone took Father's old coveralls. The neighbor, his wife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to leave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door andjust then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs, they're dragging something again. They were going toward the other building, maybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building overthere, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished building, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more or less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.Later there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroomapartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor,Asya Dallakian. She's an old woman, retired. She wasn't at home, at thattime she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, andher grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets herretirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They startedpounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there, something like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even live there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and mattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television. They started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, "My God, what is going on around here? When will this end?" We turned off the lights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn't know, but they didn't come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that he was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his apartment. His last name was Kasumov. He's an exserviceman, retired, works up at the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door.They tell him, "Comrade Captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one ofus." He went upstairs, and they say, "Aren't you taking anything from this apartment?" He says, "I don't need anything." And the women who were standing in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were standing in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the first floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time to into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty pillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really mad, and he says, "Where's the rug? I just put it right here!" They tell him, "Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school." He ran off in thatdirection.Oh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms, there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They just didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man, she didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told me, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them, the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, "Where's the girl who was here?"And he became furious. The woman tells him, "She came to . . . " She didn'tknow what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they wouldcomb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, "Shecame to and went to the basement." Now, our basement is full of water. So the whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there to get me. Then one of them said, "There's so much water down there, she probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in the basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!" I didn't know that, and when I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .After that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really didn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and started to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all. Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think that they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but they could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole brutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have beenenough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?" That's all! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not one person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were standing on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what areyou doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped abomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for one of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway, an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom: if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed to stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but theystomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, "Ifyou want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment." So she left.That trick didn't work on them.Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget that it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that ithad happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them, then I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister. And no one did anything. Anything.

Always has to stick his 'ASALA/SDPA/ARF' made nose into every discussion with non-points and lies. Well, still anxiouslyawaiting...Source: Cemal Kutay, "Ottoman Empire," vol. II., p. 188.    "The atrocities and massacres which have been committed for a long time against the Muslim population within the Armenian Republic have been  confirmed with very accurate information, and the observations made by Rawlinson, the British representative in Erzurum, have confirmed that these atrocities are being committed by the Armenians. The United States delegation of General Harbord has seen the thousands of refugees who came  to take refuge with Kazim Karabekir's soldiers, hungry and miserable,  their children and wives, their properties destroyed, and the delegation was a witness to the cruelties. Many Muslim villages have been destroyed by the soldiers of Armenian troops armed with cannons and machine guns before the eyes of Karabekir's troops and the people. When it was hoped that this operation would end, unfortunately since the beginning of  February the cruelties inflicted on the Muslim population of the region of Shuraghel, Akpazar, Zarshad, and Childir have increased. According to documented information, 28 Muslim villages have been destroyed in the aforementioned region, more than 2,000 people have been slaughtered, many possessions and livestock have been seized, young Muslim women have been taken to Kars and Gumru, thousands of women and children who were able to flee their villages were beaten, raped and massacred in the mountains, and this aggression against the properties, lives, chastity  and honour of the Muslims continued. It was the responsibility of the Armenian Government that the cruelties and massacres be stopped in order  to alleviate the tensions of Muslim public opinion due to the atrocities  committed by the Armenians, that the possessions taken from the Muslims be returned and that indemnities be paid, that the properties, lives, and honour of the Muslims be protected."Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists                             a single Turkish soul.' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)

This exercise is aimed solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.It seems to me, Dorin, that, you are so remote and ignorant of the problemon the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant,and heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation.I will try to paint the most accurate picture I can ofwhat the situation really is in South Lebanon.In article <1993Apr15.152455.14555@unocal.com>, stssdxb@st.unocal.com (Dorin Baru) writes:|> Is there any Israeli a civilian, in your opinion ?|> |> Now, I do not condone myself bombing villages, any kind of villages.|> But you claim these are villages with civilians, and Iraelis claim they are |> camps filled with terrorists. You claim that israelis shell the villages with the|> 'hope' of finding a terrorist or so. If they kill one, fine, if not, too bad, |> civilians die, right ? I am not so sure. I am.  I was back in my home village this last summer.  For your informationwe are PEOPLE, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists.  Most of the people in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their dailybusiness, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others areolder men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee.  Is that so hard toimagine ????  It is NOT a "terrorist camp" as you and the Israelis like to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccerin the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members ofthe Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people oftensuspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men aresupported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms andammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby trapsfor Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injuredby these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villagesof their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once theyare back they announce that they bombed a "terrorist  hideout" wherean 8 year old girl just happened to be.We are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is the Israeli way of telling us that "if you're gonna hurt our soldiersyou're gonna pay the price".  We accept this as a price we have to payto free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurtingthe resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but ratherjust keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young men to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks aretaking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers.Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality thatwe have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistanceon the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.The people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a regular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists thatthe so called "Security Zone" is necessary for the protection of Northern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupationwith the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace,than it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the establishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protectour villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so thebest policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and theestablishment of peace keeping troops along the border.I have written before on this very newsgroup, that the onlyreal solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peacesettlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders andpeace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insureno one on either side of the border is shelled.This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel torealize that the concept of a "buffer zone" aimed at protectingits northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much moreIsraeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israelwould have resulted in.  If Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw unilaterally from the so-called "Security Zone" before the conclusionof the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives,advance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel's public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations since Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in peace and has already offered some important concessions.Along with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollahbe disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such ashelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zoneand will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it.There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanesegoovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it iscapable of controlling and disarming all militias as they didin all other parts of Lebanon.  |> If you ask me those questions, I will have no problem answering (not with a |> question, as you did) : No, NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder, nothing|> justifies murder.I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killingCANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.

Am I wrong ?Yes, we have no quarrel with Jews, or Israeli civilians.The real problem is with OCCUPYING Israeli soldiers and those braveIsraeli pilots that bomb our civilian villages every time an occupying soldier is attacked. |> DorinBasil

Remember 'Cyprus'?>   I have to say I vehemently disagree with you, I have seenToo bad. In fact, by 1942, Nazi Armenians in Europe had established a vast network of pro-German collaborators, that extended over two continents. Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and Waffen-SS in Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in espionage and fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and Arabian Peninsula. They were promised an 'independent' state under German 'protection' in an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National Council.' (A copy of this agreement can be found in the 'Congressional Record,' November 1, 1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic, Nazi Armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often expressed pro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war. In summary,during World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might andcringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publicationin Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1]"Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews) when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it  becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing." Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews -extracts from a letter dated December 11, 1983, published in the SanFrancisco Chronicle, as an answer to a letter that had been publishedin the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian. "...We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities  against our people (Jews)...Members of our family witnessed the   murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum, Turkey, by Armenian   neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish   and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see   the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors...  Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise   to grant them self government if, in return, the Armenians would   help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of  the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists. Mr. Amarian!  I don't need your bias."    Signed Elihu Ben Levi, Vacaville, California.[1] James G. Mandalian, 'Dro, Drastamat Kanayan,' in the 'Armenian    Review,' a Quarterly by the Hairenik Association, Inc., Summer:    June 1957, Vol. X, No. 2-38.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists                             a single Turkish soul.' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)

They appear innumerous scholarly works dealing with the Palestine question. I urge thosewho have access to original sources, to verify the authenticity of thesource and post here their finding, adhering to the truth whatever it be.Thanks.Elias Davidsson------------------------------Quotations from Zionist leaders1. "There was no such thing as Palestinians"(Golda Meir, Prime Minister of Israel, London Sunday Times, 15 June 1969)2. "There is, however, a difficulty from which the Zionist dares not avert his eyes, though he rarely likes to face it. Palestine proper has already its inhabitants."(Israel Zangwill, The Voice of Jerusalem, London 1920, p.88)3. "When we have settled the land, all the Arabs will be able to do about it will be to scurry around like drugged cockroaches in a bottle."(Raphael Eitan, Israeli Chief of Staff, New York Times, 14 April 1983)4. "[The Palestinians are] beasts walking on two legs."(Menachem Begin, Prime Minister of Israel in a speech to the Knesset,quoted in Amnon Kapeliouk, 'Begin and the "Beasts", New Statesman, 25 June 1982)5. "Both the process of expropriation [of the Palestinians] and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly".(Dr. Theodor Herzl, The Complete Diaries, Herzl Press, 1960, I., p.88)6. "Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both people together in this country...The only solution is a Palestine.....without Arabs. And there is no other way than to transfer the Arabs from here to the neighboring countries, to transfer all of them; not one village, not one tribe, should be left."(Joseph Weitz, Jewish National Fund, administrator responsible for Zionist colonization. Davar, 29 September 1967).7."We shall try to spirit the penniless population [the Palestinians] across the border by procuring employment for it in the transit countries, while denying it any employment in our own country"(Theodor Herzl, The Complete Diaries, Herzl Press, 1960, I, p.88)8. "[Zionists]...looked for means...to cause the tens of thousands of sulky Arabs who remained in the Galilee to flee...I gathered all the Jewish muktars, who have contact with Arabs in different villages and asked them to whisper in the ears of some Arabs that a great Jewish reinforcement has arrived in Galilee and that it is going to burn all of the villages of the Huleh. They should suggest to these Arabs, as their friends, to escape while there is still time....The tactic reached its goal....wide areas were cleaned."(Yig'al Alon, Sepher Ha Palmach, in Hebrew, II. p.268, quoted in Khalidi, From Haven to Conquest, IPS, 1971).10. "[Jews] must expel Arabs and take their place" (David Ben Gurion, 1937, quoted in Shabtai Teveth, Ben Gurion and the Palestine Arabs, Oxford University Press, 1985, p. 89)11. "We must do everything to ensure they [the Palestinian refugees] never do return"(David Ben Gurion, in his diary, 19 July 1948, quoted in Michael Bar Zohar, Ben Gurion: The Armed Prophet, Prentice-Hall, 1967, p.157)12. "The country was mostly an empty desert, with only a few islands of Arab settlement"(Shimon Peres, Minister of Defense, quoted in David's Sling: The Arming of Israel, Weidenfeld and Nicholson, 1970, p.249)13. "All this story about the danger of extermination [of Jews] has been blown up....to justify the annexation of new Arab territories"(Mordechai Bentov, Israeli Cabinet Minister, Al Hamishmar, 14 April 1972)14. "Neither Jewish ethics nor Jewish tradition can disqualify terrorism as a means of combat"(Yitzhak Shamir, Hehazit, Summer 1943 [Journal of the LEHI, the Stern Gang], translated from the Israeli daily Al-Hamishmar, 24 December 198714. "The domination of Jewish agriculture by Arab workers is a cancer in our body"(A. Uzan, Israeli Minister of Agriculture, Ha'aretz, 13 December 1974)15. "There can be only one national home in Palestine, and that a Jewish one, and no equality in the partnership between Jews and Arabs"(Montague David Eder, President of the Zionist Federation of Great Britain, 1931,in Doreen Ingrams, comp., Palestine Papers 1917-1922, Seeds of Conflict, George Braziller, 1973, p. 135)16. "I hope that the Jewish frontiers of Palestine will be as great as Jewish energy for getting Palestine"(Dr. Chaim Weizmann, first President of the State of Israel, Excerpts from His Historic Statements, Writings and Addresses, Jewish Agency for Palestine, 1952, p.48)17. "There is not a single Jewish village in this country that has not been built on the site of an Arab village"(Moshe Dayan, Ha'aretz, 4 April 1969...)18. "Some people talk of expelling 700,000 to 800,000 Arabs in the event of a new war, and instruments have been prepared"(Aharon Yariv, former chief of Israeli military intelligence, 1980, Inquiry, 8 December 1980)19. "If I was an Arab leader I would never make [peace] with Israel. That is natural: we have taken their country."(David Ben Gurion, in Nahum Goldmann, The Jewish Paradox, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1978, p.99)20. "We should there [in Palestine] form a portion of the rampart of Europe against Asia, an outpost of civilization as opposed to barbarism."(Dr. Theodor Herzl, The Jewish State, London, 1896, p. 29)21. "I deeply believe in launching preventive war against the Arab States without further hesitation. By doing so we will achieve two targets: firstly, the annihilation of Arab power; and secondly, the expansion of our territory"(Menachem Begin, in a speech to the Knesset, 12 October 1955)22. "During the last 100 years our people have been in a process of building up the country and the nation, of expansion, of getting additional Jews and additional settlements in order to expand the borders here. Let no Jew say that the process has ended. Let no Jew say that we are near the end of the road."(Moshe Dayan, Ma'ariv, 7 July 1968)23. "Until the British left, no Jewish settlement, however remote, was entered or seized by the Arabs, while the Haganah, under severe and frequent attack, captured many Arab positions and liberated Tiberias and Haifa, Jaffa and Safad"(David Ben Gurion, Rebirth and Destiny of Israel, Philosophical Library, 1954, p.530)24. "In the months preceding the Arab invasion [of 1948], and while the five Arab states were conducting preparations, we continued to make sallies into Arab territory. The conquest of Jaffa stands out as an event of first-rate importance in the struggle for Hebrew independence early in May, on the eve of the invasion by the five Arab states."(Menachem Begin, The Revolt,  Nash, 1972, p.348)25. "What the French could do in Tunisia, I said, the Jews would be able to do in Palestine with Jewish will, Jewish money, Jewish power and Jewish enthusiasm"(Dr. Chaim Weizmann, First President of the State of Israel, Trial and Error, Harper, 1949, p.244)26. "I do not think Nasser wanted war. The two divisions he sent to the Sinai on May 14 [1967] would not have been sufficient to launch an offensive against Israel. He knew it and we knew it."(Yitzhak Rabin, Le Monde, 29 February 1968)27. "To pretend that the Egyptian forces massed on our frontiers [in 1967] were in position to threaten the existence of Israel constitutes an insult not only to the intelligence of anyone capable of analyzing this sort of situation, but above all an insult to the Zahal [Israeli army]"(General Res. Matti Peled, Ha'aretz,  19 March 1972)28. "when we have broken the strength of the Arab Legion and bombarded Amman, we would wipe out Transjordan; after that Syria would fall....we would thus end the war, and would have put paid to Egypt, Assyria and Chaldea on behalf of our ancestors"(David Ben Gurion in his diaries, quoted in Michael Bar-Zohar,  The Armed Prophet, A Biography of Ben-Gurion, Prentice-Hall, 1967, p.139)29. "These Jews of the Diaspora would like to see us, for their own reasons, heroes with our backs to the wall. But this wish can in no way change the realities."(Israeli General Ezer Weizmann, Le Monde, 3 June 1972)30. "Let us not today fling accusations at the [Palestinian Arab] murderers. Who are we that we should argue against their hatred ? For eight years now they sit in their refugee camps in Gaza, and before their very eyes, we turn into our homestead the land and the villages in which they and their forefathers have lived. We are a generation of settlers, and without the steel helmet and the cannon we cannot plant a tree and build a home. Let us not shrink back when we see the hatred fermenting and filling the lives of hundreds of thousands of Arabs, who sit all around us. Let us not avert our gaze, so that our hand shall not slip. This is the fate of our generation, the choice of our life - to be prepared and armed, strong and tough - or otherwise, the sword will slip from our first, and our life will be snuffed out."(Moshe Dayan, eulogy of Roy Rutenberg at Kibbutz Nahal Oz, 1956, quoted in Uri Avneri, Israel without Zionists, Collier Books, Macmillan, New York, 1971, p.154)

Varandian, "History of the Dashnaktsutiun," p. 85.Source: Hovannisian, Richard G.: Armenia on the Road to Independence, 1918.University of California Press (Berkeley and Los Angeles), 1967, p. 13."The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem. Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the  Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897, however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character  notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian  Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the  southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia."

"We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as  ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work  of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village.  Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts  into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable  and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets  completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They  found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border  into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole  length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to  Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain  plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of  Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for  howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the  scattered bones of the dead."

O'KeefeHARD BY THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT, within clear view of the JeffersonMemorial, an easy stroll down the Mall to the majestic Lincoln Memorial,has arisen, on some of the most hallowed territory of the United States ofAmerica, a costly and dangerous mistake.  On ground where no monument yetmarks countless sacrifices and unheralded achievements of Americans of allraces and creeds in the building and defense of this nation, sits today amassive and costly edifice, devoted above all to a contentious and falseversion of the ordeal in Europe during World War II, of non-Americanmembers of a minority, sectarian group.  Now, in the deceptive guise oftolerance, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum begins a propagandacampaign, financed through the unwitting largess of the American taxpayer,in the interests of Israel and its adherents in America.     How did the federal government allow the creation of such amonstrosity?  What is its meaning for American policy and for Americanvalues?  And what must the American people do to regain control of the landtheir servants in Washington handed over to a foreign interest and toestablish an enterprise thereon, whether a museum or otherwise, informed byand conducted according to American principles and interests?[Photograph captioned, "The five-story, $150 million US Holocaust MemorialMuseum in Washington, D.C. was built and is operated by a taxpayer-fundedfederal agency.  In the foreground is the museum's six-sided "Hall ofRemembrance."ORIGINS     In the late 1970s, during the presidency of James Earl "Jimmy" Carter,a propaganda campaign to promote the "Holocaust," the alleged systematicslaughter of some 6 million Jews by the Germans during World War II, wasorganized and carried out from Hollywood and New York. As Benjamin Meed, animportant functionary of the council which controls the Holocaust museum,wrote in 1990:                        Almost a dozen years ago, a new phenomena [sic] developed.  The     Holocaust was introduced into schools, colleges, and universities.     Television broadcast programs on the Holocaust and millions of     Americans watched them.  Soon, Americans took great interest in the     lessons of the Holocaust, its uniqueness and its universal message.(1)     Why the urgency of this campaign? Two factors were paramount:  first,the beginnings, more than three decades after the end of World War II, ofan objective scholarly assessment of the facts of the alleged German policyto exterminate European Jewry.(2)     Second, the need to justify Zionist theory and practice in the face ofunprecedented international resistance to Israeli intransigence (includingthe famous UN General Assembly Resolution which equated Zionism withracism), and to defend Israel's aggressive policy under the leadership ofthe former terrorist, Prime Minister Menachem Begin.(3)THE U.S. HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL COUNCIL     In 1978 President Carter, his administration beleaguered at home andabroad, succumbed to pressure from the new "Holocaust" lobby (and thusAmerica's influential Israel-first minority) by creating, through executiveorder, the President's Commission on the Holocaust.  Two years later, onOctober 7, 1988, Congress passed--unanimously--a law establishing theUnited States Holocaust Memorial Council, charged principally withconstructing and overseeing the operation of "a permanent living memorialto the victims of the holocaust" and with providing "for appropriate waysfor the Nation to commemorate the Days of Remembrance, as an annual,national, civic commemoration of the Holocaust..."(4)     A priceless tract of public land was turned over to the council, and,after years of costly delay (during which the U.S. Holocaust MemorialCouncil's budget swelled from $2.5 million to over $18 million a year), theU.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum has been completed and readied for openingon April 22, 1993.A SECTARIAN, ALIEN AGENDA     The Holocaust Memorial Council, besides soliciting tens of millions ofdollars in tax-deductible donations to finance the Holocaust museum, hasbusied itself with promoting an agenda of unalloyed support for minority,Zionist ends.     The membership of the council, a U.S. federal agency, has beenoverwhelmingly Jewish since its founding in 1980.  The council's twodifferent chairmen--Elie Wiesel and Harvey Meyerhoff--have both beencommitted to the support of the state of Israel, and the chairs of thecouncil's most important committees have been likewise Jewish and Zionist.     The chief fundraiser for the Holocaust museum, Miles Lerman, wasformerly American vice chairman for the State of Israel Bonds Organization,promoting tax-free investment in a country which receives by far thelargest amount of U.S. foreign aid per year.  Working the same wealthyJewish Americans he has long dealt with in his fundraising for Israel,Lerman has helped raise nearly $160 million in tax-deductiblecontributions.  The biggest donors have been rewarded by having variouscomponents of the museum named for them, e.g. the Wexler Learning Center.     Nor is erecting and operating the Holocaust Memorial Museum the onlyfunction with which the Holocaust Memorial Council has been charged.Another of its duties is to commemorate the Days of Remembrance for Victimsof the Holocaust, which Congress has raised to "an annual, national, civiccommemoration of the Holocaust."  Like the Israeli Yom Hashoah (Day of theHolocaust), on which they are based, the Days of Remembrance are datedaccording to the lunar Hebrew calendar, and thus like Passover or Chanukah,fluctuate from year to year. These foreign days of lamentation arecurrently celebrated, under the flag of the republic, to prayers and chantsin Hebrew, in governmental settings from the Capital Rotunda to city halls,across the land.  Need it be stated that no group of American victims ofpersecution, let alone another foreign group, enjoys any such federallymandated and tax-supported day, or days, of recognition?THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM'S ONE-SIDED "HISTORY"     Although the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council during its early yearsmade noises about recognizing the ordeals of non-Jews during World War II,by every indication from advance literature published by the council, theU.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum is relentlessly Judeocentric.  While,according to a preliminary ground plan of the permanent exhibit, here andthere are nods to non-Jewish groups oppressed by the German NationalSocialists (never to groups victimized by Germany's enemies, above all byStalin's USSR), the larger holocaust of World War II, which claimed anestimated 75 to 80 million lives around the world, is ignored in preferenceto the Jewish ordeal. Thus, to cite just one telling example, the museum's"Life before the Holocaust" exhibit refers strictly to *Jewish* life beforethe Holocaust.(5)     Where, in fact, non-Jews figure in the Museum, they figure largely asvillains: the Germans and their allies and collaborators; the WesternAllies, including America, who refused to accept a large immigration beforethe war; the American political and military leaders who refused toauthorize costly bombing raids on the Auschwitz "gas chambers."        RED LIBERATORS?     The museum's message that support for Jews is the sole measure ofdecency during World War II leads to anomalies which, in an American museumraised on ground hallowed to the principles of liberty on which thisrepublic is based, can only be called shocking.  That the victims of WorldWar II atrocities by the Allies--massacres such as the fire-bombing ofTokyo and Dresden, the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Sovietslaughter of their Polish prisoners at Katyn, the mass rapes carried out bythe Red Army at the war's end--receive no mention is deplorable.  But themuseum's treatment of the armed forces which defended Stalin's savageSoviet tyranny is nothing short of grotesque.     In the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, Communists appear only in theguise of "resistance fighters" and "liberators."  For example, thesubmachine gun and false papers of Samuel Weissberg, a Communist Partymember who rose to high rank in a Communist guerrilla group in NorthFrance, are on honored display, no less precious a relic than the standardheaps of shoes and hair, in the museum's permanent exhibit.(6)     Even more unsettling is the honor given to Stalin's notorious RedArmy, which compiled a bloody and shameful record of atrocities acrossEurope during, and after, the war.  As the U.S. Holocaust MemorialCouncil's newsletter fulsomely puts it, "Flags will hang in the museum tohonor the millions of Soviet soldiers who drove Nazi forces westward andwho were the first Allied forces to liberate and publicize the existence ofthe camps."  In the words of Council chairman Harvey Meyerhoff, thesemartial banners of the Red tyranny have a single association: "Much morethan simply wartime memorabilia, these military artifacts are a significantcontribution to memory, one that will remind future generations of thepivotal role Soviet forces played in defeating Nazism..."(7)     What must the millions of Americans originating or descending from theEuropean nations--Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, [former] Yugoslavia--for which the Red "military artifacts" symbolized invasion, tyranny,oppression and persecution of religion think as they see the fierce armiesof *their* persecutors hailed as "liberators"?ISRAEL IN THE MUSEUM     Just as one might guess from the circumstance that the museum'sdirector, Yeshayahu Weinberg, and the head of its "Learning Center,"Yechiam Halevy, were brought in from Israel, the museum's treatment of thestate of Israel is adulatory.  An emotive tribute to the founding of Israelis an integral part of the exhibition.  That the establishment of Israel,and its expansion in subsequent wars, has meant colonial occupation andoppression for millions of the land's native Palestinians, anddispossession and exile for millions more, goes unmentioned--anothergrotesquery in an American museum supposed to instruct in the dangers ofintolerance and disregard of human rights.  As for the momentouscollaboration between Hitler's German state and the Jewish Agency in the1930s, which through the Ha'avara Agreement enabled the transfer of vitalcapital and the influx of tens of thousands of highly skilled Jewishimmigrants to Palestine, that is passed over in utter silence.(8)"HISTORICAL CORRECTNESS"     The Holocaust Museum's skewed history is not simply a matter of one-sidedness and omission.  The museum has further committed itself to a fixedand final interpretation of the surprisingly scanty and sometimes suspectevidence for a German policy of annihilating European Jewry, largely in gaschambers, in numbers approaching 6 million.  This despite a considerablebody of research and scholarship that has arisen over the past two decadesin many lands, and which contests, by academic means, the substance of theHolocaust "extermination thesis."(9)     That the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council is aware of the work of therevisionists is clear: The council's literature is replete, not withsubstantive refutations of revisionist scholarship, but with slander andpolemic.  To cite one characteristic example, the _U.S. Holocaust MemorialMuseum Newsletter_ of May, 1992 featured a front-page attack on Holocaustrevisionism by Professor Deborah Lipstadt of Occidental College in whichthe author decried the revisionists for producing material that lookedscholarly, then lauded the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum as "among themost efficacious ways" of "combating this pernicious trend," *whileneglecting to specify a single error of revisionist scholarship.*(10)     The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council recognizes that there is ahistorical debate on the holocaust, but takes official notice of thedissenting position only to attack it.  That an American institution,supported by the taxes of all Americans, should commit itself to inflexiblehistorical orthodoxy--in the service of a single American minority--is anintolerable imposition on our First Amendment rights, as well as a mockeryof the Western, and American, ideal of objective scholarship.A CENTER FOR EDUCATION?     U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council Chairman Harvey Meyerhoff has stated:"The museum is primarily an educational institution."(11)  From thecouncil's own literature, however, it is clear what Meyerhoff means byeducation.  The "role-playing" for children as well as adults who visit themuseum (visitors are to be issued "identity cards" bearing the name andalleged fate of various Holocaust victims); the high-tech computer andvideo effects and the recordings of speech and music which augment themuseum's tendentiously described artifacts; and the museum's goal, asproclaimed by its Zionist fundraising chairman, Miles Lerman, of ensuringthat "Children in Dubuque, families in Tucson, and schoolteachers inAtlanta will learn the history and the lessons of Auschwitz as thoroughlyas they learn the history of their own communities"--all these show thatthe U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum is a *propaganda* enterprise that seeksto indoctrinate all Americans in a uniquely and partisanly Jewish (andZionist) version of not merely the past, but the present and thefuture.(12)THE AMERICAN RESPONSE     What is the American response to a partisan museum constructed in aplace solemnly consecrated to the heroes and the values of our republic, tobe lavishly operated with taxpayer dollars at a time when, even in ourcountry's capital, thousands sleep homeless in the shadow of our nationalmonuments?  What is the American response to an ambitious propaganda agendathat aims to impose a sectarian "Holocaust remembrance" in schools whereour children cannot pray, in town halls and federal buildings from whichthe religious symbols of the majority are banned in the name of freedom ofworship?     Over two centuries ago, Thomas Jefferson wrote: "To compel a man tofurnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which hedisbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical."(13)     Nearly 150 years ago, Abraham Lincoln said: "I insist that if there is*anything* which it is the duty of the *whole people* to never entrust toany hands but their own, that thing is the preservation and perpetuity oftheir own liberties and institutions."(14)     The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, and the council which runs it, asagencies of the government in which the American people is sovereign, mustbe removed from the special interest that now controls it.     The scope and purpose of the Museum must be expanded, from its presentone-sided emphasis on foreign Jewish sufferings, real and imagined, inEurope during the 1930s and 1940s to a compassionate yet realistic concernfor *all* victims, but above all for *American* victims, of historicinjustice.     The Museum must be made a place where Americans of every heritage, andscholars of every viewpoint, may gather, educate, and be educated, withoutaccusation and in the absence of propaganda.  Until it is, the men andwomen who founded and built and suffered and fought and died for America,of every race, nationality and creed, will rest uneasy.NOTES     1. _The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Newsletter_(Washington, D.C.), August, 1990, "Survivors Play Major Role inEstablishing the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum," p.1.

This fits in well with a report inthe New York Times from April 18, 1993:***********************************Scores of Girls in Egypt Faint in ClassroomsBy Chris HedgesCairo, April 17The khamseen, the blustery sandstorms that arrive every spring, havebrought with them not only the usual clouds of grit and dust but alsowhat the authorities describe as collective hysteria.Hundreds of teen-age girls have been fainting en masse in classrooms,breaking out in sobs and complaining of unpleasant smells and nausea.[...]"There is no clinical reason for it," said Dr. Ahmed Rashed at AgouzaHospital, where dozens of girls have been tested.  "It's justhysteria.  We have carried out blood tests, urine tests, every kind oftest we can think of and nothing has shown up."More than a thosand young girls between 12 and 18 have sufferedattacks in some 40 schools across the country since the first caseswere reported over two weeks ago.[...]Lawmakers and commentators have attributed the fainting to everythingfrom food posoning to a plot by unamed enemy agents to make Egyptianwomen infertile. Similar attacks have been reported from time to time through Europe.One was reported about a decade ago in the Israeli-Occupied GazaStrip. Islamic fundamentalist leaders have blamed the Israeli secret servicefor the spells.  "This is all the work of the Mossad," said a militantcleric in Imbaba, a Cairo slum.  "They are seeding capsules around thecountry that release something into the air that can't be detected.It has a special effect on the hormones of young girls.  It is part ofa plot to destroy Egypt."  [Where have seen this argument before?  Because there is no  evidence for the conspiracy, therefore it must be true...][...]Health Minister Ragheb Dewidar said that neither medical orenvironmental tests had found any contaminant and that the cause waspsychological.  "If one girl who is popular or a leader feels faintfor some reason," he said, "the others start believing that they aresuffering from the sypmtoms."But no one is taking the matter lightly.  Prime Minister Atef Sedkihas held regular mettings with Mr. Dewidar to discuss the attacks.Government officials say they are determined to bring the phenomenonto an end."Parents and teachers should fight against these rumors and accept theresults of our scientific analysis," Education Minister Hussein KamalBahadeen said.***********************************You can't make this stuff up.

The Ottomans didn't recognizeTurks, Arabs, Greeks, Serbs... Just christians, muslims, jews...So, for all the interested parties in the Ottoman society thebosnian muslims were "Turks".

Ahh yes, those charming humanitarian death squads.I've actually seen a videotape of an interrogation (DSee the documentary _Deadly Currents_--very neutral and balanced--seriously)--It was rather inquisition-esque. essentially, to prove his loyalty to "the cause" ofwhichever group it was that was interogating him, he had to turn in someoneelse, or else face death in one of the many fun-filled ways that the death-squads love so much--beatings, dismemberment, acid, pouring melted plasticon the face of the 'guilty party,' and of course beheading, always my favorite.  Did you catch the photos in the Washington Post a while back the execution of a "collaborator?"  3 photos:1) one Palestinian leading another at gunpoint.2) The "collaborator" on his knees, the gun pointed at his temple.3) The executioner standing on the corpse of the "collaboratorshouting about how this is what happens to collaborators.Wonderful justice system, and lots of regard for Human rights.Remember Black September?Ok, so they just tried to take over Jordan, big deal.I'm rambling now, but are you getting what I'm saying?Amir

Having lived in EuropeI realize that incidences such as the one described in theletter have occured. The U.S. media as a whole seem to try toignore them. The U.S. is subsidizing Israels existance and theEuropeans are not (at least not to the same degree). So I thinkthat might be a reason they report more clearly on theatrocities.What is a shame is that in Austria, daily reports ofthe inhuman acts commited by Israeli soldiers and the blessingreceived from the Government makes some of the Holocaust guiltgo away. After all, look how the Jews are treating other raceswhen they got power. It is unfortunate.

During the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day, Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland, which is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocidein order to shift international public opinion away from its politicalresponsibility.2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish Genocide.3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism throughthe ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-SovietArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence throughterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supportersof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community frommaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorialdemands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish peoplewill unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victimsof the Turkish Genocide demand:1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian Dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish andKurdish people;3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officiallyrecognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuseto succumb to all Armenian political pressure;5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of 2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

Humane behavior and tolerance of Turks was alegend even 500 years ago when they accepted tens of thousands of Jews from Spain who were fleeing from the Spanish Inquisition. Again, many Jewish families escaping from Nazi Armenians and Hitler's Nazi Germany took refugee in Turkiye during the 1940's. Turkish peoplehave unselfishly given home, protection, and freedom to the Jews over the centuries, including to thousands and thousands of them during the Second World War.

And one recalls that the Jews took up their abode in 'fanatic' Turkey when they were expelled from Europe, especially Spain, by Saintly Christians, and they have lived here for centuries in at least as much tranquility and liberty as their fellow Turkish subjects, all being exposed alike to the rapacity of their common rulers. To one brought up, as most Americans have  been, in the Gladstonian and foreign-missionary tradition, the condition of  the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every  nation in the world would have treated as treasonable. One readily  reaches the conclusion that the Jews in Turkey were fortunate..." He also stated that:"they [Armenians] traitorously turned Turkish cities over to the Russian  invader; that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and fifty thousand men to fight a civil war, and that they burned at least a hundred Turkish villages and exterminated their population."                TURKEY AND THE HOLOCAUSTAn  interview  with  Stanford  J. Shaw  (History),  who  recentlycompleted  two books:  The Jews  of  the Ottoman  Empire and  theTurkish Republic, and Turkey and  the Holocaust: Turkey's Role inRescuing  Turkish  and  European  Jewry  from  Nazi  Persecution,1933-45. Shaw  chairs the undergraduate  interdepartmental degreeprogram in Near Eastern Studies and has organized the Program forthe Study of Ottoman and Turkish Jewry. He is affiliated with theG. E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies.Editor: How did  you come to write these two  books on Turkey andEuropean and Turkish Jews?Shaw: Basically, I'm  an Ottoman historian, but  I'm also Jewish.I've  spent twenty-five  years studying  Ottoman history,  and astime went along, whenever I  found materials on the Ottoman Jews,I collected  them. But  I never  did anything  with them  until acouple of years  ago, when I suddenly realized that  1992 was the500th  anniversary of  the  Jews being  expelled  from Spain  andcoming  to Turkey.  Then the  Sephardic Temple  down on  WilshireAvenue invited me  to give a series of three  lectures on OttomanJewry.  These lectures  were  greatly appreciated,  and I  becamemotivated to  undertake further research  to develop a  book, TheJews of the  Ottoman Empire and the Turkish)  Republic. This bookis quite different from the  works of most Jewish historians, whotend to look  at the Jews in any country  more from the viewpointof the Jews  and the Jewish community, and rely  mainly on Jewishsources.  I  view my  subject  as  an  Ottoman historian,  and  Iapproach the Jews of the Ottoman Empire largely from the point ofview of Ottoman  society, using largely Ottoman  sources. After Ifinished  this book  and  sent it  to the  press,  I came  acrossadditional documents  relating to  Turkish Jews during  World WarII. In the completed book, I had said that Turkey had done a gooddeal  to rescue  the Jews  during  World War  II, but  I did  notactually have many details. Then I  found a batch of documents inthe Foreign Ministry archive relating to actions taken by Turkishdiplomats to  help the Jews  before and during the  Holocaust. Itwas too late to add this new information to the book in press, soI decided to  write a second book. I  conducted further research,mainly in the archives of the  Foreign Ministry in Ankara and theTurkish Embassy and Consulate in Paris. The result was the secondbook, Turkey and  the Holocaust, which details  how Turkey helpedrescue Jews from the Nazis.- How exactly did they do this?The story takes  place over a number of years.  The book presentsthe material in three parts, first of which deals with the periodbefore the Holocaust. When the Nazis  came to power in Germany in1933,  they immediately  started  dismissing  Jews and  anti-NaziGermans from universities,  hospitals, scientific institutes, andthe like. Turkey at that moment was just beginning the process ofreforming its  universities, and it  saw in these Jews,  who werebeing fired from their positions in Germany, a good source of newtalent to  help modernize the Turkish  universities. Within threemonths  after the  Nazis  started dismissing  these Jews,  Turkeyarranged to take many of them in. They were brought to Turkey andwere   given   appointments   as  professors   in   the   Turkishuniversities, as  heads of scientific institutes,  and as medicalpersonnel in hospitals. About 300  to 500 major Jewish professorscame to  Turkey in  the 1930s. Ernst  Reuter, a  German politicalscientist,  spent the  war  years teaching  political science  inTurkey. After  World War II,  he was  mayor of Berlin  during theBerlin Airlift.  Fritz Neimark, a major  German Jewish economist,came to Turkey and helped  establish a modern school of economicsin Istanbul.  A man named  Reichenbach, who was rescued  from theNazis by  Turkey and  spent the war  years in  Turkey, eventuallycame to  UCLA, where he  became a professor of  philosophy. OtherGerman Jewish  emigres engaged in cultural  activities in Turkey.One  such was  Karl  Ebert,  who had  been  a leading  theatricalproducer in Berlin until he was expelled by the Nazis. He went toTurkey, where he  organized the Turkish National  Theater and theTurkish National Opera  Company in Ankara, with the  help of PaulHindemuth. So  the first  section of the  book covers  this firstphase, when Jews were being  persecuted in Germany and rescued byTurkey.  Oddly enough,  the  German emigres,  when  they were  inTurkey, did not seem to think too badly of Germany. They regardedthemselves more  as Germans than Jews,  and they did not  join inthe anti-Nazi activities of the local Turkish Jewish community. Ieven  found  letters  from  the Nazi  representatives  to  Turkeypraising these German Jewish refugees for their work in promotingthe idea  of German  culture. Even though  these people  had beenpersecuted by the Nazis and rescued by the Turks, they shared theNazis' feelings of  Aryan racial superiority over  the Turks. Thesecond part of the book deals  with the Holocaust, which began in1940 when the Nazis occupied France.  In Europe at that time, andespecially in France, there were  about 20,000 Turkish Jews. Theyhad migrated to Europe for various reasons from about the turn ofthe century onward. Most of them had settled in Europe during theTurkish war for  independence after World War I,  when Greece wasthreatening to overrun Turkey. The Greeks had persecuted the Jewsthroughout the nineteenth century, and the Jews feared what mighthappen to them if the Greeks  took over in Turkey. Many Jews fledto France during  the 1920s and 1930s. Many  also abandoned theirTurkish  citizenship and  became  French  citizens. Suddenly  theNazis invaded France in 1940 and started introducing all sorts ofanti-Jewish laws.  The Turkish  Jews soon found  that it  was notworth very much to  be a French Jew, but that it  was worth a lotto be a Turkish Jew.- How so?Turkey remained neutral through most of World War II. It retainedits embassies  and consulates in all  the Nazi-occupied countriesuntil it finally entered the war on the side of the Allies at theend of 1944. During the war,  therefore, Turkey was in a positionto  defend its  citizens  against anti-Jewish  measures, and  theactions that  Turkish diplomats took  form the second  chapter ofthe  book. Turkish  diplomats  who were  stationed  in France  inparticular intervened to protect Jews of Turkish citizenship fromthe Nazis. For those Turkish  Jews who had retained their Turkishcitizenship,  there  was  generally  no  problem.  If  they  werearrested and sent to a  concentration camp, the Turkish diplomatswould  communicate with  the  commanders of  the  camp and  otherofficials and say in effect:  "These people are Turkish citizens.You  can't do  this  to  them." And  the  Turkish  Jews would  bereleased.  If  their  businesses were  confiscated,  the  Turkishdiplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored.The Nazis  in general  wanted to keep  the friendship  of Turkey.They hoped to be able to use  Turkey as a gateway for an invasionof the Middle  East, and they also wanted to  obtain chromium andmanganese from Turkey. In order  to keep Turkish friendship, theyusually accepted  these interventions on behalf  of Turkish Jews.The Turkish  diplomats sometimes went to  the concentration campsto secure the release of Turkish Jews. At times they even boardedtrains hauling  Turkish Jews  to Auschwitz for  extermination andsucceeded in getting them off the train. Most of the foreign Jewswere sent  to a concentration  camp at  a place called  Drancy inParis,  and that's  where  most of  the  intercession by  Turkishconsuls took place.The greater problem came with  the Turkish Jews who had abandonedtheir  Turkish citizenship  and had  become French  citizens. Theconsuls couldn't declare that  these people were Turkish citizensbecause  they were  not.  My book  includes  photographs of  Jewslining  up in  front  of  the Turkish  consulate,  either to  getpassports to  return to Turkey or  to get a restoration  of theirTurkish  citizenship.   This  was   a  bureaucratic   matter,  soprocessing the application would take  some time. In the meantimeit was a  real emergency, because the Nazis would  arrest Jews onthe streets for almost nothing.  The Nazis would even arrest themif they  had radios  or telephones  in their  apartments, becauseradios and  telephones were  forbidden to Jews.  To take  care ofthese  former  Turkish Jews,  the  Turkish  diplomats invented  adocument called  gayri muntazem  vatandash, or  "irregular fellowcitizen." The  document said in  effect "This person is  a formerTurkish  citizen  who has  applied  for  the restoration  of  hisTurkish citizenship.  In the meantime  we would appreciate  it ifyou  would treat  him  as  if he  were  a  Turkish citizen."  Thediplomats wrote  the document in  Turkish and put their  seals onit. Since  the Nazis could  not read  Turkish, on the  whole theyaccepted  these papers  as certificates  of citizenship.  By thismeans, the  Turkish diplomats were  able to rescue many  Jews whohad relinquished their Turkish citizenship.Actually the Nazis were of two minds about the Turkish defense ofJews. On the one hand the  Nazi Foreign Ministry, which wanted toretain the friendship of Turkey,  was in favor of accepting theseinterventions. On the other hand, Himmler and Eichmann wanted allJews exterminated.  At times  Himmler and  Eichmann were  able toprevail and some  of the Turkish Jews were sent  off to Auschwitzbefore the Turkish consuls could do anything.- Do you have statistics on how many Turkish Jews were rescued?There were about  20,000 Turkish Jews in Europe  before world WarII,  about 10,000  of whom  were living  in France.  Most of  theinformation in this section of  the book relates to the situationin France. I have published  the letters that the Turkish consulssent to  the Nazi  officials and  the letters  that came  back inreply. Generally the Nazis said  that if the Turkish consul wouldpresent  documents  certifying   that  arrested  individuals  areTurkish citizens,  and promise  to send them  out of  France, theNazis would release them from the concentration camp. The Turkishconsuls also organized  special trains to take  Turkish Jews fromNazi-occupied  territory   back  to  Turkey.  These   trains  ranregularly in 1943 and 1944. The Nazis gave the Turkish Jews visasso they  could pass out  of Nazi  territory, but the  trains wereoften  held  up by  the  Nazi-influenced  governments of  EasternEurope  -   Croatia,  Serbia,   and  Bulgaria  -   because  thesegovernments really didn't want the Jews to escape. As a result ofthe Turkish consuls' efforts, about 3,000 to 4,000 of the TurkishJews  in  France were  saved.  Another  3,000  were sent  off  toAuschwitz, where  most of them  died. The remaining  3,000 eitherescaped  across the  border into  Spain or  fled to  the area  ofsouthern France occupied  by the Italians, who  treated Jews muchbetter than  the Nazis did.  At the  end of 1943,  however, Italyfell out of the war, and that was the end for those Jews as well.Incidentally, the Turkish diplomats  in Nazi-occupied Greece alsoworked to rescue Jews in that country.- The second part of your  book then deals with Turkish diplomatsacting to  rescue Jews of  Turkish citizenship or  Turkish originfrom Nazi persecution.Yes,  and  there  is  an  aside   I  might  add  here:  In  theirinterventions on  behalf of Turkish  Jews, the Turks  cited theirtreaty with Germany which stated  that Turkish citizens in Germanterritory would be treated the same as German citizens in Turkey.On  that basis  the Turks  maintained  that the  Nazis could  notdiscriminate  against Turkish  citizens who  are Jews.  The Nazisclaimed  (and the  Vichy government  agreed) that  they were  notdiscriminating  because  they  were treating  all  Jews  equally.Turkey  protested,   saying,  "You  are  dividing   our  citizensaccording to religion, but the Turkish constitution requires thatall  citizens   be  treated  equally,  regardless   of  religion.Therefore, you cannot single  out Turkish Jews." American consulsin  Paris,  by contrast,  accepted  the  Nazi argument  and  toldAmerican Jews  who were being  persecuted by the Nazis  that theycouldn't do  anything about  it, because  the American  Jews werebeing treated the same as other  Jews. The third part of the booktakes place in Turkey, which  was the principal center during theHolocaust for activities aimed at  the rescue of Eastern EuropeanJews. The  kwish Agency, an  organization established by  Jews inPalestine to help resettle Jews to Palestine, set up an office inIstanbul  in 1940  under the  leadership of  Chaim Barlas.  OtherJewish organizations in Palestine, especially the kibbutzes, alsosent representatives  to Istanbul  to set up  headquarters. Thesegroups first tried to contact Jews  in Eastern Europe to find outwhat was  happening. Today  we know about  the Holocaust,  but atthat  time people  didn't know  what  was going  on. They  didn'timagine the Nazis could do the things they were doing. And so thefirst step was to get information, and the Turkish government letthem use the Turkish mails to send letters to their relatives andfriends  in Eastern  Europe. The  Jewish organizations  found outwhat was happening when they  received replies. Later on when theNazis  began  to  intercept   such  letters,  the  Jews  receivedassistance  also from  the  Vatican nuncio,  Angelo Roncali,  whoserved as  the Vatican  representative in  Istanbul from  1935 to1944  and   later  became  Pope   John  XXIII.  As   the  Vaticanrepresentative  during the  war, he  used the  facilities of  theCatholic  Church to  supplement what  the Turkish  government wasdoing to  assist Jewish  agencies in  contacting Jews  in EasternEurope.  With the  cooperation of  the Turkish  government, theseagencies  then  sent  hard  currency, food,  clothing,  and  evenrailroad  and  steamship  tickets   to  Jews  in  Czechoslovakia,Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. They weren't able to help much inPoland because  by then the  Nazis had  wiped out almost  all thePolish Jews.  Whenever possible the rescue  agencies arranged forthe Jews to get out of Eastern Europe either by train through theso called  Orient Express route  to Istanbul, or by  boat throughthe Black Sea to Istanbul.Turkey was not eager for all  these refugees to remain within itsborders during  the war, because  it was being blockaded  and wassuffering   terrible  shortages   of  food   and  clothing.   Thegovernment,   therefore,   facilitated   the  movement   of   thenon-Turkish Jewish  refugees from Turkey to  Palestine, either bythe Taurus  Express Railroad through  the mountains to  Syria andPalestine,  or by  small boats  across the  eastern Mediterraneanfrom southern  Turkey to  Palestine. These efforts  were bitterlyopposed not only  by the Nazis, but also by  the British, who didnot want  any more Jewish  immigration to Palestine  because theyfeared it would hurt their  relations with the Arabs. The Britishconstantly pressured the Turkish  government to stop this trafficand send those Jews back. In  a few cases the Turkish government,yielding  to  British pressure,  did  send  the boats  back.  Forexample, in  one incident,  the steamship  Struma, with  some 700Jewish  refugees  from Romania,  was  sent  back by  the  Turkishgovernment  as  a  result  of the  intervention  of  the  Britishambassador. When  that ship was  sunk by a Soviet  submarine, allwere lost except one person.  Nevertheless, all told, the Turkishgovernment allowed no fewer than 100,000 Eastern European Jews topass through  Turkish territory and  move on to  Palestine duringthe Second World War. The Turkish authorities also provided theserefugees with facilities  and money, and gave  them permission tosend money and food out of the country.- Many  of these  Jews who  passed  through Turkey  may still  beliving in Israel.Yes, and  their children. But  let's return  for a moment  to thefirst group, the Turkish Jews who  came from Europe. They did notgo  on  to   Palestine;  they  stayed  in  Turkey.   It  was  thenon-Turkish, Eastern  European Jews who passed  through Turkey enroute to Palestine. Their story is very interesting.- And you have rescued it from obscurity.Many studies have been made of the Holocaust, but most of them donot focus on the Eastern European or Middle Eastern Jews. Most ofthe scholarship  has centered  on the  Western European  Jews, ofwhom 6 million were massacred by the Nazis. My study deals with amuch smaller  number of  people. I  have tried  to round  out thepicture,  and I  hope my  book  will persuade  other scholars  toundertake further investigations in the history of Eastern Jews.When it  comes to numbers,  the German Jews were  also relativelysmall in number. Most of the millions slain were Polish Jews. Therescue  of  100,000  Eastern  European   Jews  may  not  seem  sosignificant  compared  with  the  total of  6  million  who  weremurdered, but it meant a lot to those who were saved.About  three-fourths   of  the  book  consists   of  documents  -translations  of many  documents. They  are included  because thestory is not well known. Not  only are people in the West unawareof  the courageous  actions of  the Turkish  diplomats; even  thepeople of Turkey  did not know the story. I  felt that they wouldnot  fully understand  this  remarkable  achievement unless  theycould see the documents.- What languages are used in the documents?Most of them are in Turkish  or French; some are in Hebrew. Thereis a great  deal of material in Hebrew about  the organization ofthe boats  going to Palestine, the  passengers, and so on,  but Idid not go into those details extensively. I describe mostly whatTurkey did, so  most of my documents are in  Turkish or French. Afew documents are  in English. The Jewish groups  in Istanbul didnot necessarily  cooperate with  one another  to rescue  Jews; infact, they often fought with  one another. They took turns tryingto  get  the  Turkish  government to  deport  rival  groups.  Forexample, some of  the kibbutz groups felt that  the Jewish Agencywas  run by  Western European  Jews who  were interested  only inhelping  Western  European  Jews.  Finally,  in  1944,  PresidentRoosevelt sent a personal  representative, Ira Hirschman, who hadbeen an executive of Bloomingdale's  department store in New YorkCity, and  Hirschman managed to reconcile  their differences. Thedocuments related to his mission are in English.I also obtained many documents  from Serge Klarsfeld, a Holocausthistorian in France,  who mainly worked on the  French Jews. (Hisfather was  killed by  the Nazis.)  He gave  me materials  he hadgathered in the German archives on  the Turkish Jews, so I didn'tpersonally consult the German archives.  I believe that much morecan  be learned  from the  German  archives, and  I hope  someonesomeday will make the effort.- This new book fits in well with your teaching, doesn't it?Right. I'm  giving a  course on  the history of  the Jews  of theOttoman  Empire.  I first  gave  the  course  two years  ago.  Inaddition to  research, writing, and teaching,  I've been activelyinvolved in  the commemoration  of the  500th anniversary  of thecoming of the  Jews to the Ottoman Empire. Among  other things, Ihelped organize  a large international conference  on the subjectwhich was held in Istanbul in 1992.- Now that your  books are finished and the  conference has takenplace, what do you plan to do next?I'm working on two new books. One is a history of the Turkish Warfor Independence, which took place  after World War I, during theyears  1918 to  1923. The  Turks warded  off the  efforts of  thevictorious  European   powers  to  occupy  Turkey   and  end  itsindependence. The  second book is  a study of Sultan  Abdul HamidII, the last major sultan, who ruled from 1876 to 1909. He was animportant modernizer in his own  way, although he also suppressedall sorts of political movements.Stanford  J. Shaw  received  a B.A.  in History  and  an M.A.  inBritish History. He then shifted to Near Eastern History, earninga second M.A.  and a Ph.D. at Princeton. As  a doctoral candidateat Princeton, he  spent two years abroad, studying  at the Schoolof  Oriental  and  African  Studies, University  of  London;  theUniversity of  Cairo, the American  University at Cairo,  and theUniversity of  Istanbul. He  taught at  Harvard before  coming toUCLA in 1966. His postdoctoral research has been supported by theJohn Simon Guggenheim Foundation, the American Research Institutein  Turkey, the  Social  Science Research  Council, the  NationalEndowment for the Humanities, the Fulbright Program, and ISOP. Hehas  received  honorary  degrees   from  Harvard  University  andBosporus University, Bebek, Istanbul, Turkey, and medals of honorfor lifetime contributions  to the fields of  Islamic and Turkishstudies from the Center for Research in Islamic History, Art, andCulture in  Istanbul and from  the American Friends of  Turkey inWashington,  D.C. In  addition to  undertaking many  professionalservice activities and public lectures  in both the United Statesand Turkey,  Shaw has  also produced eight  books and  one editedvolume. His  History of  the Ottoman Empire  and Modem  Turkey (2vols.)  has been  published  in many  editions  (six editions  orreprints  from 1977-1991),  and  translated  into Turkish  (1983,1991) and French (1984). His book  The Jews of the Ottoman Empireand  the  Turkish  Republic  (MacMillan,  London,  and  New  YorkUniversity Press, 1992) will  be published in Turkish translationby the Turkish  Historical Society, Istanbul. His  Turkey and theHolocaust: Turkey's  Role in Rescuing Turkish  and European Jewryfrom Nazi  Persecution, 1933-1945 will be  published by MacmillanPublishers,  London, and  New York  University Press  in 1993.  Apamphlet summarizing the book was published in Ankara, Turkey, in1992.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

Your fascist government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. And your criminal organization will not get away with the genocide's cover-up. In June 1915, a major uprising took place in Sebinkarahisar under the leadership of the famous Nazi Boyadjian. The Moslem districts were burnt down. Hundreds of soldiers and gendarmerie were killedand hundreds of civilians also perished.   Armenians first of all occupied the Talori region, which included    the villages of Siner, Simai, Gulli-Guzat, Ahi, Hedenk, Sinank,   Ekind, Effard, Musson, Etek, Akcesser. Leaving their wives,    children and property in these inaccessible spots, the Armenians    joined forces with other armed bands coming from the Silvan    districts in the plain of Mus, after which the whole body of   3000 men gathered in the Andok Mt. Five or six hundred wished   to surround Mus, and started off by attacking the Delican tribe to   the south of the city. They slaughtered a number of the tribe and   seized their goods. The religious beliefs of the Muslims who fell   into their hands were derided and disparaged, and the Muslims   themselves murdered in the most frightful manner. The rebels   also attacked the regular troops in the vicinity of Mus, but the   large numbers of the regular forces prevented them from   occupying the city.   The rebels joined the bandits in the Andok Mts., carrying out   the most frightful massacres and looting among the tribes of the   neighbourhood. They burned Omer Agha's nephew alive. They   raped a number of Turkish women at a spot three or four hours'   distance from Gulli-Guzat and then strangled them.   At the beginning of August the rebels attacked the Faninar,   Bekiran and Badikan tribes, perpetrating equally horrible   atrocities. The rebels in the villages of Yermut and Ealigernuk in   the nahiye of Cinan in the kaza of Cal attacked the Kurds in the   neighbourhood, as well as the villages of Kaisser and Catcat.   Towards the end of August, the Armenians attacked the   Kurds in the vicinity of Mus and burned down three or four   villages, including Gulli-Guzat. As for the 3000 rebels in Talori,   they continued to spread death and destruction among the   Muslims and other Christian communities, refusing to lay down   their arms.

This was  responsible for the tragic incident at Maras....the Armenians had completely  destroyed an old Mohammedan town like Maras by their artillery and  machine-gun fire. They killed thousands of innocent and defenceless women and children. The Armenians were the instigators of the atrocities, which were unique in history.  Source: Documents: Volume I (1919).

Its inspectors are drawnfrom all over the world, and few have any experience in bomb building.Such experience would make the job of determining if a site was beingused for military purposes much easier.Unfortunately, many countries object to knowledgeableinspectors, because the only really knowledgeable inspectors come fromabout 10 countries.There was an excelent article on the Feb 1 1993 New Yorker onwhy the IAEA fails to do its job.AdamAdam Shostack        adam@das.harvard.edu"If we had a budget big enough for drugs and sexual favors, we surewouldn't waste them on members of Congress..."   -John Perry Barlow

NewsEthiopian Jews and not-quite JewsThe Israeli press has published items about Ethiopian Jews waiting in camps in Addis Ababa for immigration to Israel, who are dying of starvation. The following are excerpts from an interview with the former general director of the JDC project for development and welfare of Ethiopian Jews, Kobi Friedman (Hadashot, 21 April 1993), who has stated that "there are people dying in Addis Ababa, but they are converts to Christianity":"Hadashor published the item about the dying Jews after viewing a video tape filmed last week in Adis Ababa. How do you know that they are actually converts to Chritianity ?"If there are Jews on the tape, then I don't know what to say. I am speaking from experience when I say that those who remained in Ethiopia are Christians. I know that there have previously been things published in the press by interesting parties, and there is no connection between them and reality.""What interested parties ?""Ethiopian immigrants who want their Christian relatives to come here.""What to you recommend that Ethiopian children in Israel do, when their parents and the rest of their relatives remain in Ethiopia ?""I ask if it is the job of the State of Israel to bring in the 40 relatives who stayed in Ethiopia.

OnlyTV could transmit the full sadness of his face. "You say that weteach our children to hate you, but what do you expect to happento a child who sees this ?" And once again he wraps himself in alengthy silence, his face crumbling into weeping. Mahmoud stood inthe field of rubble that was once his home. The term'dispossession' has an absolute meaning here. Nothing is left ofwhat he accumulated during his entire life, only the rubble of ahouse and shreds of belongings.Once again Khan Yunis. Once again demolished homes. Last Thursdaythere was a search for wanted people here. Once again the IDFforces employed the new method, fired and bombed and shot missilesand placed explosives. Already three times during the past weeks Ihave gone out to see the destruction and each time I was morehorrifying scenes. This time they hit the largest number ofhouses, 17 according to the IDF estimate, ten of them completelydemolished. But not only that:  the method has also become morebrutal. Three weeks ago, in Tufah neighborhood in Gaza, theresidents were still told to remove their valuables from theirhomes.  This time the army skipped that part; three weeks ago thehandcuffed men, inhabitants of the demolished homes, were suppliedwith some water and one apple during the 12 hours they had tostand. This time there was only water. Three weeks ago they wereeven allowed to go out to the toilet. This time the soldier justgold them: Piss and shit in your pants. And thus, last Thursday,some 45 men stood for about 12 hours, their hands bound behindtheir backs, their eyes blindfolded, without food, with wet pantson their legs and a terrible feeling of humiliation in theirhearts, listening to the sounds of the explosions destroying theirhomes, one after the other.(...)Dr. Juma'a Fuad Said al-Rubi. the brother from Saudi Arabia,emerges from among the ruins. Ten days ago he arrived for a familyvisit, mainly in order to celebrate the housewarming with hisfather and brothers. On Thursday he was handcuffed like everyoneelse for 12 hours, and later went with everyone to view thedestrucion. He tried to explain that he was a visitor and that heis a physician, but only got a shove.  Like all the rest he alsourinated in his pants, while standing with his hands bound and hiseyes blindfolded for the entire day. Juma'a al-Rubi studiedmedicine at Cairo University, and for ten years he has beentreating wealthy Saudis in Medina. His wife and four childrenremained there. Now his documents have been lost and he does notknow how he will return to them. "There is no humanity", statedthe physician from Saudi Arabia.

They habe been kept under occupation by Israel since 1967without civil and political rights. It is a fact that Gazans live in their own country, Palestine. Gaza isnot a foriegn country. Nor is TelAviv, Jaffa, Askalon, BeerSheba foreigncountry for Gazans. All these places are occupied as far as Palestiniansare concerned and as far as common sense has it. It is a fact that Zionists deny Gazans equal rights as Israeli citizensand the right to determine by themsevles their government. When Zionistswill begin to consider Gazans as human beings who deserve the samerights as themselves, there will be hope for peace. Not before.Somebody mentioned that Gaza is 'foreign country' and therefore Israelis entitled to close its borders to Gaza. In this case, Gaza should beentitled to reciprocate, and deny Israeli civilians and military personnelto enter the area. As the relation is not symmetrical, but that of a masterand slave, the label 'foreign country' is inaccurate and misleading.To close off 700,000 people in the Strip, deny them means of subsistenceand means of defending themselves, is a collective punishment and acrime. It is neither justifiable nor legal. It just reflects the abyss to which Israeli society has degraded. I would like to ask any of those who heap foul langauge on me to explainwhy Israel denies Gazans who were born and brought up in Jaffa to returnand live there ? Would they be allowed to, if they converted to Judaism ?Is their right to live in their former town depdendent upon theirreligion or ethnic origin ? Please give an honest answer.Elias

As I stated, religionThere are various contradictory views on the origin of the Armenians.The name is to be found in the Darian inscriptions in the form 'Armina'or 'Aramaniya' is to be found in the inscription on the Bistun monument.The following references to the Armenians are to be found in the Bistuncuneiform inscription of Dara Vishdasb (510 B.C.). 1. The monarch Dara said: I sent my servant to Arminam 'Armeniya'. 6. On reaching Arminam 'Armeniya'. 7. To the country town of Zozo, to Armaniya 'Armeniya'.According to Karakashian:As for 'Armenia', the equivalent of the 'Armin' or 'Arminik' of the Persians,this is more recent than the word 'Ararat', and is to be found used inthe Dara inscriptions for 'Haiastan'.  Saint Martin:The name 'Armenie' has been given since very early times by almost allthe various eastern peoples to the territory referred to by the Armeniansas 'Haiastan'. It was known to the Syrians as Armenia and to the Arabsas Ermeniyye. Others believe that Urartu was known in the time of the Medes as 'Harminap'which was later modified by the Persians to 'Arminia'. 'Ar' refers to aplace, as in Ararat, Archish, Aruyr, Archar, Arshav, Arazen and Aror, while 'men' is used to refer to spirit, thought or human being, and therefore 'Armen' would appear to signify 'the people of that place'.G. Alishan believes that 'according to our national vocabulary "Haik"is the diminutive form of "Hai", and that "Hai" is the name of ournation. Our nation is in no way connected with the word "Armen" thatforeigners apply to our people.'It would thus appear that 'Armenia' is a place-name, that 'Armen' is the name of the people who lived there, and that these are in no wayconnected with the word 'Hai'.Haik and Haiastan:Armenian historians believe Haik to have been a great hero from whomthe Armenian people took the name 'Hai'. But the mere resemblancebetween the words 'Haik' and 'Hai' constitutes no real proof, and,in any case, no such theory appears before the time of Moses ofKhoren.Haiasa:The following studies show quite clearly that 'Hai' and 'Haiasa' wereno more than general names used by the Hittites to refer to the region known as Armenia.Professor Hachadurian: 'Haiasa was the general name used in Hittiteinscriptions for Upper Armenia.'Yensen, in his 'Hittites and Armenians' tries to prove that 'Hai' isidentical with the Hittite 'Hatio', in other words that 'Hai' is aHittite word. Research, however, has proved this erroneous, and shownthat 'Hai' was derived from 'Hatio'.Mortman's attempt to read the Urartu inscriptions as Armenian met with no success. As for Greek, there is no point in even mentioning it.The resemblance between the words 'Haiasa' and 'Haiastan' is so obviousthat we may well accept 'Haiasa' as the oldest form of 'Haiastan'.Let us now cast a brief glance on how the words 'Hai', 'Haikazan' and'Haiastan' entered our older works.According to Karakashian: 'The word "Haik" is never to be found employed with reference to aleader of the Armenian people prior to Moses of Khoren, nor is itever found employed in the forms "Haika" or "Haykazn".Agahangelos and Puzant use the word as a title or a place-name (heimproved and developed Haiastan, etc.). If the word had referredto a nation and had been derived from "Hai" or "Haik" they could also have used the words "Haikak" and "Haykazn" in a number ofplaces.'According to Professor Sayce, who deciphered a number of Hittite inscriptions:'In the Hittite language the suffix -ha is used to specify qualityor species. The words "Haddanas", "Haddina" were used by the Assyrians to refer to the Hittites. With the transformation of the"d" between the two "a" letters to "y" "Hadinasdani" was in thisway transformed to "Haiastan"'.Professor Grechmer fully agrees with this point of view, but regardsthe significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms 'Hai'and 'Haistan' as quite unsatisfactory. He finds, however, that a solution to this problem is brought nearer by the name 'Haiasa' which is so frequently found in Bogazkoy from 1400 B.C. onwards.Forrer takes 'Haiasa' as referring to Upper Armenia. In that caseit seems likely that 'Haiasa' was actually a part of Armenia. Thesuffix -dan is of Anatolian origin. The real root is 'Hayasa', whichrefers to the country of the 'Hayasas'.E. Chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological and Anthropological characteristics of the Armenian people.The Armenians in Russia may be characterized as follows: Almostall of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic, very dark,above average height, an Aissores Asian group with close tieswith certain Kurdish tribes and Azerbaijan peoples.According to J. Deniker:From the philological point of view, the Armenian and Kurds may beregarded as belonging to the Iranian group...The Armenians are descended from various elements and from a very mixed race. Theiraverage height varies between 1.63 and 1.69 according to the region.They are almost always short-headed, with skull measurements of 85-87. As a race they belong to the Indo-Afghan-Assyrian-Turkicfamily.Professor Rene Vernont writes as follows:The Armenians are a mixture of Semites, Turk, Kurds and Mongols,but some of them display Armenian features, e.g., height a littleabove average, fair complexion, dark hair, dark eyes, very oftena hooked nose and a rather wide mouth. Investigations carried out by N. Kossovitch on the links betweenArmenian blood groups and their anthropological characteristicsled him to the conclusion that the Armenians did not form a distinct race.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists                             a single Turkish soul.' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)

If Azeris are dyingbecause of a policy of attacking Armenians, then something is wrong with this policy.If I recall correctly, it was Stalin who caused all this problem with landin the first place, not the Armenians.henrik]  However, I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplanehenrik]  to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the onehenrik]  that happened last SUMMER.

I'm going to count on the supposition that you thinkthrough the opinions you have - something which is, by the way, againstmy better judgment based on what I've seen from you to date.  We areagreed, aren't we, that dictionaries are *reference books* for the usageof a given language, and in particular for the meanings of the words andphrases which comprise that language?  Now, you are using meaningscompletely different from, indeed in some cases diametrically differentfrom, those given in the dictionary.  As a reference book, a dictionarycontains those meanings in both past and (as much as it can) in currentuse.  That's also why they are updated so often.  Now, if you are sayingthings which you give different meanings than the dictionary does, andusing non-standard meanings about every word, what is your chance ofbeing taken at face value...?Just about none.  Just about no one will take you that way because thewords mean something different to them.  It's quite clear to me fromthe response this thread has been getting that that is exactly what ishappening.  Ponder that.>>>And guess why. Isn't it curious that we do not know how many people define >>>in how many different ways the term Jew, which is the basis of the movement >>>itself?>>>>No, probably because the question hasn't been asked?  Gee, I hate it>>when people draw conclusions without information, don't you?>>I hate people who cannot read. I did not draw any conclusion. I just >said that it is curious, considering how heterogeneous the movement is.What you did was ask a leading question.  In English idiom, the phrase"and guess why..." in the way you used it is a loaded question, withonly one answer expected.  I also take offense at being told I cannot read by someone who isobviously having trouble with the subject himself.  Mr. Pinkas, I am aPhD candidate in my field.  One does not get to PhD candidacy if onecannot read.  >>>>the Law of Return and Jewish Nationality is defined in terms of religion and>>>not of cultural identity, even if 80% of those defined as Jews in Isreal>>>are not religious.>>>>For the umpteenth time:  it is NOT defined in terms of religion.>>This has been proven to you over and over again.>>No, it has not.

If Elchibey thinks he can get away with bombing Armenia from the hills of Kelbajar, his people will pay the price. It also seems other non-Azeri minorities in Azerbaijan have understood theyare next in line in this process of forced Azerification or deportation. Just look at the situation with the Lezgians.About the Kurds...what Kurds! According to the Azerbaijani government, there are no Kurds in Azerbaijan. Can't they make up their minds? Oh I see, there are only Kurds when the Azeris want them to be Kurds! And anyway, this "60 Kurd refugee" story, as have other stories, are simple fabrications sourced in Baku, modified in Ankara. Other examples of this are Armenia has no border with Iran, and the ridiculous story of the "intercepting" of Armenian military conversations as appeared in the New York Times supposedly translated by somebody unknown, from Armenian into Azeri Turkish, submitted by an unnamed "special correspondent" to the NY Times from Baku. Real accurate![h]       However, I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplane [h]       to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the one[h]       that happened last SUMMER. Turkey searched an AMERICAN plane[h]       (carrying humanitarian aid) bound to ARMENIA.[h]No, Henrik, these Turkish planes should be shot down with no questions asked.[HE]Don't speak about things you don't know: 8 American Cargo planes[HE]were heading to Armenia. When the Turkish authorities[HE]announced that they were going to search these cargo [HE]planes 3 of these planes returned to it's base in Germany.[HE]5 of these planes were searched in Turkey. The content of[HE]of the other 3 planes? Not hard to guess, is it? It was sure not[HE]humanitarian aid.....Your "facts" in error. Shipments of all kinds that have transversed Turkey have been either searched, re-routed or confiscated. Some American planeswere searched, others were re-routed, others were untouched. Rail shipments were held up last fall and last winter from entering Armenian from Turkeyfor the purpose of aiding in the economic collapse of Armenia. Wheat wasconfiscated, other shipments were exchanged with "crap" and dirt, thenshipped to Armenia. U.S. planes don't have to use Turkish air bases. The U.S.uses these bases to bomb Iraq. Anyway, U.S. planes can fly over Georgia, whichthey have found is easier than to endure unnecessary expressions of Turkish chauvinism through searches of cargo which to this day have not revealed anything other than a paranoid Turkish military. [HE]Search Turkish planes? You don't know what you are talking about.[HE]since it's content is announced to be weapons? Well, big mouth Ozal said military weapons are being provided to Azerbaijanfrom Turkey, yet Demirel and others say no. No wonder you are so confused![HE]Turkey's government has announced that it's giving weapons[HE]to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan[HE]it self, not the Karabag province. So why search a plane for weapons[HE]since it's content is announced to be weapons? You are correct, all Turkish planes should be simply shot down!

O'KeefeHARD BY THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT, within clear view of the JeffersonMemorial, an easy stroll down the Mall to the majestic Lincoln Memorial,has arisen, on some of the most hallowed territory of the United States ofAmerica, a costly and dangerous mistake.  On ground where no monument yetmarks countless sacrifices and unheralded achievements of Americans of allraces and creeds in the building and defense of this nation, sits today amassive and costly edifice, devoted above all to a contentious and falseversion of the ordeal in Europe during World War II, of non-Americanmembers of a minority, sectarian group.  Now, in the deceptive guise oftolerance, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum begins a propagandacampaign, financed through the unwitting largess of the American taxpayer,in the interests of Israel and its adherents in America.     How did the federal government allow the creation of such amonstrosity?  What is its meaning for American policy and for Americanvalues?  And what must the American people do to regain control of the landtheir servants in Washington handed over to a foreign interest and toestablish an enterprise thereon, whether a museum or otherwise, informed byand conducted according to American principles and interests?[Photograph captioned, "The five-story, $150 million US Holocaust MemorialMuseum in Washington, D.C. was built and is operated by a taxpayer-fundedfederal agency.  In the foreground is the museum's six-sided "Hall ofRemembrance."ORIGINS     In the late 1970s, during the presidency of James Earl "Jimmy" Carter,a propaganda campaign to promote the "Holocaust," the alleged systematicslaughter of some 6 million Jews by the Germans during World War II, wasorganized and carried out from Hollywood and New York. As Benjamin Meed, animportant functionary of the council which controls the Holocaust museum,wrote in 1990:                        Almost a dozen years ago, a new phenomena [sic] developed.  The     Holocaust was introduced into schools, colleges, and universities.     Television broadcast programs on the Holocaust and millions of     Americans watched them.  Soon, Americans took great interest in the     lessons of the Holocaust, its uniqueness and its universal message.(1)     Why the urgency of this campaign? Two factors were paramount:  first,the beginnings, more than three decades after the end of World War II, ofan objective scholarly assessment of the facts of the alleged German policyto exterminate European Jewry.(2)     Second, the need to justify Zionist theory and practice in the face ofunprecedented international resistance to Israeli intransigence (includingthe famous UN General Assembly Resolution which equated Zionism withracism), and to defend Israel's aggressive policy under the leadership ofthe former terrorist, Prime Minister Menachem Begin.(3)THE U.S. HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL COUNCIL     In 1978 President Carter, his administration beleaguered at home andabroad, succumbed to pressure from the new "Holocaust" lobby (and thusAmerica's influential Israel-first minority) by creating, through executiveorder, the President's Commission on the Holocaust.  Two years later, onOctober 7, 1988, Congress passed--unanimously--a law establishing theUnited States Holocaust Memorial Council, charged principally withconstructing and overseeing the operation of "a permanent living memorialto the victims of the holocaust" and with providing "for appropriate waysfor the Nation to commemorate the Days of Remembrance, as an annual,national, civic commemoration of the Holocaust..."(4)     A priceless tract of public land was turned over to the council, and,after years of costly delay (during which the U.S. Holocaust MemorialCouncil's budget swelled from $2.5 million to over $18 million a year), theU.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum has been completed and readied for openingon April 22, 1993.A SECTARIAN, ALIEN AGENDA     The Holocaust Memorial Council, besides soliciting tens of millions ofdollars in tax-deductible donations to finance the Holocaust museum, hasbusied itself with promoting an agenda of unalloyed support for minority,Zionist ends.     The membership of the council, a U.S. federal agency, has beenoverwhelmingly Jewish since its founding in 1980.  The council's twodifferent chairmen--Elie Wiesel and Harvey Meyerhoff--have both beencommitted to the support of the state of Israel, and the chairs of thecouncil's most important committees have been likewise Jewish and Zionist.     The chief fundraiser for the Holocaust museum, Miles Lerman, wasformerly American vice chairman for the State of Israel Bonds Organization,promoting tax-free investment in a country which receives by far thelargest amount of U.S. foreign aid per year.  Working the same wealthyJewish Americans he has long dealt with in his fundraising for Israel,Lerman has helped raise nearly $160 million in tax-deductiblecontributions.  The biggest donors have been rewarded by having variouscomponents of the museum named for them, e.g. the Wexler Learning Center.     Nor is erecting and operating the Holocaust Memorial Museum the onlyfunction with which the Holocaust Memorial Council has been charged.Another of its duties is to commemorate the Days of Remembrance for Victimsof the Holocaust, which Congress has raised to "an annual, national, civiccommemoration of the Holocaust."  Like the Israeli Yom Hashoah (Day of theHolocaust), on which they are based, the Days of Remembrance are datedaccording to the lunar Hebrew calendar, and thus like Passover or Chanukah,fluctuate from year to year. These foreign days of lamentation arecurrently celebrated, under the flag of the republic, to prayers and chantsin Hebrew, in governmental settings from the Capital Rotunda to city halls,across the land.  Need it be stated that no group of American victims ofpersecution, let alone another foreign group, enjoys any such federallymandated and tax-supported day, or days, of recognition?THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM'S ONE-SIDED "HISTORY"     Although the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council during its early yearsmade noises about recognizing the ordeals of non-Jews during World War II,by every indication from advance literature published by the council, theU.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum is relentlessly Judeocentric.  While,according to a preliminary ground plan of the permanent exhibit, here andthere are nods to non-Jewish groups oppressed by the German NationalSocialists (never to groups victimized by Germany's enemies, above all byStalin's USSR), the larger holocaust of World War II, which claimed anestimated 75 to 80 million lives around the world, is ignored in preferenceto the Jewish ordeal. Thus, to cite just one telling example, the museum's"Life before the Holocaust" exhibit refers strictly to *Jewish* life beforethe Holocaust.(5)     Where, in fact, non-Jews figure in the Museum, they figure largely asvillains: the Germans and their allies and collaborators; the WesternAllies, including America, who refused to accept a large immigration beforethe war; the American political and military leaders who refused toauthorize costly bombing raids on the Auschwitz "gas chambers."        RED LIBERATORS?     The museum's message that support for Jews is the sole measure ofdecency during World War II leads to anomalies which, in an American museumraised on ground hallowed to the principles of liberty on which thisrepublic is based, can only be called shocking.  That the victims of WorldWar II atrocities by the Allies--massacres such as the fire-bombing ofTokyo and Dresden, the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Sovietslaughter of their Polish prisoners at Katyn, the mass rapes carried out bythe Red Army at the war's end--receive no mention is deplorable.  But themuseum's treatment of the armed forces which defended Stalin's savageSoviet tyranny is nothing short of grotesque.     In the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, Communists appear only in theguise of "resistance fighters" and "liberators."  For example, thesubmachine gun and false papers of Samuel Weissberg, a Communist Partymember who rose to high rank in a Communist guerrilla group in NorthFrance, are on honored display, no less precious a relic than the standardheaps of shoes and hair, in the museum's permanent exhibit.(6)     Even more unsettling is the honor given to Stalin's notorious RedArmy, which compiled a bloody and shameful record of atrocities acrossEurope during, and after, the war.  As the U.S. Holocaust MemorialCouncil's newsletter fulsomely puts it, "Flags will hang in the museum tohonor the millions of Soviet soldiers who drove Nazi forces westward andwho were the first Allied forces to liberate and publicize the existence ofthe camps."  In the words of Council chairman Harvey Meyerhoff, thesemartial banners of the Red tyranny have a single association: "Much morethan simply wartime memorabilia, these military artifacts are a significantcontribution to memory, one that will remind future generations of thepivotal role Soviet forces played in defeating Nazism..."(7)     What must the millions of Americans originating or descending from theEuropean nations--Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, [former] Yugoslavia--for which the Red "military artifacts" symbolized invasion, tyranny,oppression and persecution of religion think as they see the fierce armiesof *their* persecutors hailed as "liberators"?ISRAEL IN THE MUSEUM     Just as one might guess from the circumstance that the museum'sdirector, Yeshayahu Weinberg, and the head of its "Learning Center,"Yechiam Halevy, were brought in from Israel, the museum's treatment of thestate of Israel is adulatory.  An emotive tribute to the founding of Israelis an integral part of the exhibition.  That the establishment of Israel,and its expansion in subsequent wars, has meant colonial occupation andoppression for millions of the land's native Palestinians, anddispossession and exile for millions more, goes unmentioned--anothergrotesquery in an American museum supposed to instruct in the dangers ofintolerance and disregard of human rights.  As for the momentouscollaboration between Hitler's German state and the Jewish Agency in the1930s, which through the Ha'avara Agreement enabled the transfer of vitalcapital and the influx of tens of thousands of highly skilled Jewishimmigrants to Palestine, that is passed over in utter silence.(8)"HISTORICAL CORRECTNESS"     The Holocaust Museum's skewed history is not simply a matter of one-sidedness and omission.  The museum has further committed itself to a fixedand final interpretation of the surprisingly scanty and sometimes suspectevidence for a German policy of annihilating European Jewry, largely in gaschambers, in numbers approaching 6 million.  This despite a considerablebody of research and scholarship that has arisen over the past two decadesin many lands, and which contests, by academic means, the substance of theHolocaust "extermination thesis."(9)     That the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council is aware of the work of therevisionists is clear: The council's literature is replete, not withsubstantive refutations of revisionist scholarship, but with slander andpolemic.  To cite one characteristic example, the _U.S. Holocaust MemorialMuseum Newsletter_ of May, 1992 featured a front-page attack on Holocaustrevisionism by Professor Deborah Lipstadt of Occidental College in whichthe author decried the revisionists for producing material that lookedscholarly, then lauded the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum as "among themost efficacious ways" of "combating this pernicious trend," *whileneglecting to specify a single error of revisionist scholarship.*(10)     The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council recognizes that there is ahistorical debate on the holocaust, but takes official notice of thedissenting position only to attack it.  That an American institution,supported by the taxes of all Americans, should commit itself to inflexiblehistorical orthodoxy--in the service of a single American minority--is anintolerable imposition on our First Amendment rights, as well as a mockeryof the Western, and American, ideal of objective scholarship.A CENTER FOR EDUCATION?     U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council Chairman Harvey Meyerhoff has stated:"The museum is primarily an educational institution."(11)  From thecouncil's own literature, however, it is clear what Meyerhoff means byeducation.  The "role-playing" for children as well as adults who visit themuseum (visitors are to be issued "identity cards" bearing the name andalleged fate of various Holocaust victims); the high-tech computer andvideo effects and the recordings of speech and music which augment themuseum's tendentiously described artifacts; and the museum's goal, asproclaimed by its Zionist fundraising chairman, Miles Lerman, of ensuringthat "Children in Dubuque, families in Tucson, and schoolteachers inAtlanta will learn the history and the lessons of Auschwitz as thoroughlyas they learn the history of their own communities"--all these show thatthe U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum is a *propaganda* enterprise that seeksto indoctrinate all Americans in a uniquely and partisanly Jewish (andZionist) version of not merely the past, but the present and thefuture.(12)THE AMERICAN RESPONSE     What is the American response to a partisan museum constructed in aplace solemnly consecrated to the heroes and the values of our republic, tobe lavishly operated with taxpayer dollars at a time when, even in ourcountry's capital, thousands sleep homeless in the shadow of our nationalmonuments?  What is the American response to an ambitious propaganda agendathat aims to impose a sectarian "Holocaust remembrance" in schools whereour children cannot pray, in town halls and federal buildings from whichthe religious symbols of the majority are banned in the name of freedom ofworship?     Over two centuries ago, Thomas Jefferson wrote: "To compel a man tofurnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which hedisbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical."(13)     Nearly 150 years ago, Abraham Lincoln said: "I insist that if there is*anything* which it is the duty of the *whole people* to never entrust toany hands but their own, that thing is the preservation and perpetuity oftheir own liberties and institutions."(14)     The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, and the council which runs it, asagencies of the government in which the American people is sovereign, mustbe removed from the special interest that now controls it.     The scope and purpose of the Museum must be expanded, from its presentone-sided emphasis on foreign Jewish sufferings, real and imagined, inEurope during the 1930s and 1940s to a compassionate yet realistic concernfor *all* victims, but above all for *American* victims, of historicinjustice.     The Museum must be made a place where Americans of every heritage, andscholars of every viewpoint, may gather, educate, and be educated, withoutaccusation and in the absence of propaganda.  Until it is, the men andwomen who founded and built and suffered and fought and died for America,of every race, nationality and creed, will rest uneasy.NOTES     1. _The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Newsletter_(Washington, D.C.), August, 1990, "Survivors Play Major Role inEstablishing the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum," p.1.

THOSE INTREPID ISRAELI SOLDIERS    Israeli soldiers have sexually taunted Arab women in the occupied Gaza Strip  during the three-week-long closure that has sealed Palestinians off from the  Jewish state, Palestinian sources said on Sunday.  The incidents occurred in the town of Khan Younis and involved soldiers of the Golani Brigade who have been at the centre of house-to-house raids for Palestinian activists during the closure, which was imposed on the strip and occupied West Bank.  Five days ago girls at the Al-Khansaa secondary said a group of naked soldiers taunted them, yelling: ``Come and kiss me.'' When the girls fled,  the soldiers threw empty bottles at them.      On Saturday, a group of soldiers opened their shirts and pulled down their pants when they saw girls from Al-Khansaa walking home from school. Parents  are considering keeping their daughters home from the all-girls school.      The same day, soldiers harassed two passing schoolgirls after a youth escaped from them at a boys' secondary school. Deputy Principal Srur  Abu-Jamea said they shouted abusive language at the girls, backed them  against a wall, and put their arms around them.  When teacher Hamdan Abu-Hajras intervened the soldiers kicked him and beat him with the butts of their rifles.  On Tuesday, troops stopped a car driven by Abdel Azzim Qdieh, a practising Moslem, and demanded he kiss his female passenger. Qdieh refused, the  soldiers hit him and the 18-year-old passenger kissed him to stop the  beating.  On Friday, soldiers entered the home of Zamno Abu-Ealyan, 60, blindfolded him and his wife, put a music tape on a recorder and demanded they dance. As the elderly couple danced, the soldiers slipped away. The coupled continued dancing until their grandson came in and asked what was happening.      The army said it was checking the reports.                 ....................        ISRAELI TROOPS BAR CHRISTIANS FROM JERUSALEM  Israeli troops prevented Christian Arabs from entering Jerusalem on Thursday  to celebrate the traditional mass of the Last Supper.      Two Arab priests from the Greek Orthodox church led some 30 worshippers in prayer at a checkpoint separating the occupied West Bank from Jerusalem after soldiers told them only people with army-issued permits could enter.      ``Right now, our brothers are celebrating mass in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and we were hoping to be able to join them in prayer,'' said Father George Makhlouf of the Ramallah Parish.      Israel sealed off the occupied lands two weeks ago after a spate of Palestinian attacks against Jews. The closure cut off Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza Strip from Jerusalem, their economic, spiritual and cultural centre.     Father Nicola Akel said Christians did not want to suffer the humiliation of requesting permits to reach holy sites.      Makhlouf said the closure was discriminatory, allowing Jews free movement to take part in recent Passover celebrations while restricting Christian celebrations.      ``Yesterday, we saw the Jews celebrate Passover without any interruption. But we cannot reach our holiest sites,'' he said.      An Israeli officer interrupted Makhlouf's speech, demanding to see his identity card before ordering the crowd to leave.                    ...................

The Qur'an still exists in thesame language that it was revealed in - Arabic.  Therefore, we knowthat mankind has not changed its meaning.  It is truly what was revealedto Mohammed at that time.

Turkey has however ruled out, for the secondtime in one week, that it would intervene militarily in Azerbaijan.Wednesday, Inonu told reporters Ankara would not allow Azerbaijan to sufferdefeat at the hands of the Armenians. "We feel ourselves bound to helpAzerbaijan, but I am not in a position right now to tell you what form (that)help may take in the future," he said.He said Turkish aid to Azerbaijan was continuing, "and the whole world knowsabout it."Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel reiterated that Turkey would not getmilitarily involved in the conflict. Foreign policy decisions could not be based on street-level excitement, he said.There was no immediate reaction in Ankara to regional reports, based onArmenian sources in Yerevan, saying Turkish pilots and other officers werecaptured when they were shot down flying Azerbaijani warplanes and helicopters.The newspaper Cumhuriyet said Turkish troops were digging in along the borderwith Armenia, but military sources denied reports based on claims by localpeople that gunfire was heard along the border. No military action has occurred, the sources said.The latest upsurge in fighting between the Armenians and Azerbaijanis flaredearly this month when Armenian forces seized the town of Kelbajar and laterpositioned themselves outside Fizuli, near the Iranian border.-- David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | "How do we explain Turkish troops onS.D.P.A.

For nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people lived on their homeland - the last one hundred under the oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation. The persecutions culminated in 1914: The Armenian Government planned and carried out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their homeland. After one thousand years, Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turksand Kurds. The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.Today, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia.Today, x-Soviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against humanity.x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds.Turks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands,to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland....On this occasion, we once again reiterate the unquestioned justice of the restitution of Turkish and Kurdish rights and...- We demand that the x-Soviet Armenian Government admit its responsibility for the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide, render reparations to the Muslim people, and return the land to its rightful owners.

He survives... but falls silent. One of the most revolting "triumphs" in the senseless, mindless history of Armenian terrorism. Such a murder brings absolutely nothing - except an ego boost for the murderer within the Armenian terrorist underworld, which is already wallowing in self-satisfaction.

JCAG and SDPA claim responsibility.Source: Edward K. Boghosian, "Radical Group Hosts Well-Attended SolidarityMeeting," The Armenian Reporter, May 1, 1986, pp. 1 & 18.ATHENS, Greece - An array of representatives of Greek political parties,including the ruling PASOK party, and a host of political groups, bothArmenian and non-Armenian, joined to voice their solidarity with the Armenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a newArmenian political force were voiced here on Sunday, April 20 duringthe 2nd International Meeting of Solidarity with the Armenian People. Andjudging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of thesepolitical groups and organizations, at least here in Greece, the ArmenianCause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world.The International Meeting of Solidarity was sponsored by the Greek branch ofthe Armenian Popular Movement, a comparatively new political force headedby younger generations of Armenians, who openly profess their support of thearmed struggle and of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia(ASALA). The organization has branches in various European and Middle Easterncountries and the United States although some of these branches appear tohave gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranksof ASALA...Voicing the support of PASOK, the ruling party in Greece, to the Armenianpeople, was Mr. Charalambidi Michalis, a member of the Central Committee ofthe party and the Greek member of the Permanent People's Tribunal...Explaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement was Ara Sarkisian. Significant was the address delivered by Mr. Bassam Abu-Salim, on behalf of the Popular Front for the movement's continued support of the Armenians' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause, pledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be open to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle. Later, Mr. Abu-Salim, answering a question put to him by this writer, affirmed that his organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and thatthis policy will continue. "The doors of our camps are always open to Armenian freedom fighters," he affirmed.Among the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the sonof Prime Minister Papandreou, who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet;two members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for thespecific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives ofthe Christian Democratic party, EDIK Center party, two wings of the Communistparty, representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations,a number of mayors of Greek towns and cities; two Greek members of theEuropean Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also amongthose who participated in the international conference. Also on hand to followthe deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens.More than significant was the large number of messages received by the organizers, including the following: Palestinian National RevolutionaryMovement, Fatah; Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-GeneralCommand; the Central Committee of the Palestinian National LiberationMovement-Fatah; the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon; Arab SocialistLabor Party; the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq; and numerous otherinternational groups, all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.                 SUPPORT FROM ARF-RMAmong messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian RevolutionaryFederation-Revolutionary Movement, the group that has claimed the abductionand assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out toforeign interests and powers. The message clearly gave its support to theArmenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement willcontinue to "reveal the realities, no matter how bitter or tragic they are,"to expose the anti-Armenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag "Bureau."The message was taken as an indication of the link, loose as it may be, thatexists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement,open supporters of ASALA and armed struggle.The Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of theGreek capital, known as Neos Kosmos, where there is a large Armenian presence.The headquarters are located in a two-story building, which appears to haveturned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth, whoprefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves...Now any comment?#From: vd8@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu (Vedat  Dogan)#Subject: Re:Addressing.....#Message-ID: <1993Apr8.233029.29094@news.columbia.edu> In article <1993Apr7.225058.12073@urartu.sdpa.org> dbd@urartu.sdpa.org (David Davidian) writes:>In article <1993Apr7.030636.7473@news.columbia.edu> vd8@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu>(Vedat  Dogan) wrote in response to article <1993Mar31.141308.28476@urartu.>11sdpa.org> dbd@urartu.sdpa.org (David Davidian) writes:> >[(*] Source: "Adventures in the Near East, 1918-1922" by A.

Let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)  First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You called Serdar Argic a liar!.. I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote... (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)  And now, you are lying again and talking about "modified,re-published book"(without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..).. (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was  first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some 'pretty   well suited theories', as usual)  And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian's lies...I also give the call number and page numbers again for the library use, which are:                   949.6 R 198     and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215                    > >It is not possible that [(*]'s text has 287 pages, mine has 353, and yours has>377!  Now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying "it is not possible..." ..If not, what is your point?  Differences in the number of pages? Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934.. No need to use the same book size and the same letter  charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!  The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year first published..  And you tried to hide the whole point.. the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given  by Serdar Argic exist!!  It was the issue, wasn't-it?    you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway?   You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a "crap".. People who think like you are among the main reasons why the World still has so many "craps" in the 1993.   Any question? Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

There many people alive today who were born in >a city called Konstantinoupolis. I know it doesn't make sense, but since when is 'Napoleon' aboutsense, anyway? Further striking bigoted and racist attitude of certain Greeks still exists in our day. Most Greeks insist even today, that the 537 year-old capital of the Ottoman Empire should be called not by its rightful name of Istanbul, but by its half a millennium-old moniker 'Cons*(whatever).'Everyone knows that New York City was once called 'New Amsterdam'but Dutch people do not persist on calling it that today. The name of Stalingrad too is long gone, replaced by Volgagrad. China'sPeking traded its name for Beiging long ago. Ciudad Trujilloof the Dominican Republic is now Santa Domingo. Zimbabve'sold colonial capital Salisburry became Harrare. These changeshave all been accepted officially by everyone in the world.But, Greeks are still determined on calling the Turkish Istanbul by the name of 'Cons*.'How can one explain this total intransigence? What makes Greeksso different from other mortals? 18-year-old questionabledemocracy? Why don't they seem to reconcile with the fact,for instance, that Istanbul changed hands 537 years ago in1453 AD, and that this predates the discovery of the New World, by 39 years. The declaration of U.S. independencein 1776 will come 284 years later.Shouldn't then, half a millennium be considered enough time for 'Cons*' to be called a Turkish city? Where is the logic in the Greek reasoning, if there is any? How long can one sit on the laurels of an ancient civilization? Ancient Greece does not exist, any more than any other 16 civilizations that existed on the soil of Anatolia.These undereducated 'wieneramus' live with an illusion. It is the same mentality which allows them to rationalizethat Cyprus is a Greek Island. No history book showsthat it ever was. It belonged to the Ottoman Turks 'lock,stock and barrel' for a period of well over 300 years.In fact, prior to the Turks' acquisition of it, followingbloody naval battles with the Venetians in 1570 AD, theisland of Cyprus belonged, invariably, to several nations:The Assyrians, the Sumerians, the Phoenicians, the Egyptians,the Ottoman Turks, of course in that order, owned it as their territory. But, it has never been the possessionof the government of Greece - not even for one day -in the history of the world. Moreover, Cyprus islocated 1500 miles from the Greek mainland, but only 40 miles from Turkiye's southern coastline.Saddam Hussein claims that Kuwait was once Iraqiterritory and the Greek Cypriot government and the terrorist Greek governments think that Cyprusalso was once part of the Greek hegemony.Those 'Arromdians' involved in this grandiose hallucinationshould wake up from their sweet daydreams and confront reality. Again, wishful thinking is unproductive, only facts count.As for Selanik,  <<Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled  particularly to Salonica, whose Jewish population increased substantially  as a result, from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908, more than half the  total population, though even there increased persecution by local Greeks  led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, particularly to  the great port of Izmir.  Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike, the ritual  murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on. Greek  efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912  and 1913, following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War,  when many of its Jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>>  <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow  Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to  practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923  which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday, stimulating a new  Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a  series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where  most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This  was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting  Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also  on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica  for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By  killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a  substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting  Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the  occupation of Greece starting in 1941.  Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for  Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.  Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received  thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by  the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in  flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained  independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the  Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during  and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements  in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among  its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim  refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the  Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly  to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as  800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and  east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more  came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-  1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,  with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the  Empire.>>[47] Robert Mantran, 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de  Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle', RH no.534 (1980), 391-92;  Nehama VII, 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2,  12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775, 10 January 1900 (AIU  Archives I-C-41), describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek  children in the streets of Salonica.

Your claim that the Lebanese/Syrian Landlords sold Palestine(if true, even partially) omits the fact that the mandatetreaty put Lebanon and Syria under French rule, whilePalestine under british.  Obiviously, any such landlordwould have found himself a foreigner in Palestine and wouldbe motivated to sell, regardless of the price.It is interesting though that you acknowledge that thepalestinians were shafted. Do many Israelis or Jews shareyour opinion ?  Do you  absolve the purchaser fromany ethical commitments just because it wasn't written down? All told, I did not see an answer in your response. Thequestion was whether the intent behind the purchase wasaimed at controlling the public assets (land,infra-structure etc...).

A perfect example is the outcry over the temporary removal of    400 men who advocated murdering Jews and destroying the State    of Israel, compared to the deafening silence over the abusive    treatment of Jews in Arab countries during the past 50 years.    Compare the tacit appoval that the world gives to Muslims who    randomly murder Jewish civilians to the righteous indignation    expressed if people in the occupied territories are kept from    working in Israel in an effort to reduce these random murders    from occuring, while everyone knows that no country is at all    required to accept foreign workers, except Israel, of course.    Jewish blood has always been cheap.  The non-Jewish world ha    never regarded any form of Jewish suffering important, except    when the Jews were the models of the powerless victim holding    the high moral ground, as it had been just after World War 2.      However, as soon as the Jewish people started to take care of     themselves, the ancient hatred of Jews was unleashed again.          I doubt if the non-Jewish world is even capable of having any    compassion towards Jews as anti-semitism is so ancient and so    basic to both Christianity and Islam.          Golda Meir said that there would be peace when the Arabs love    their own children more than they hate the Jews.  And while I    know that there are more Arab parents who love their children     than those who would send their children out into the streets     to throw rocks at men trained to defend themselves with guns,    the world is so obsessed by a hatred of Jews trying to defend     themselves that they have yet to even question the actions of     those parents who not simply allow their children to do this,     but encourage them to throw themselves into harm's way.  Even     Arab children are expendable, if their tragic deaths are used     in the neverending propoganda battle to blame Israel, and the      Jews, for any misfortune befalling Arabs in the middle east.        *       *       *       *       *       *       *             Who is a Jew?

You realize itwould not work, as the Arab countries' treatment of Jews over thelast several decades is so bad that your fixation on Israel wouldbegin to look like the biased attack that it is.   Everyone in this group recognizes that your stupid 'Center forPolicy Research' is nothing more than a fancy name for some bigotwho hates Israel.

Entire population of the region was subjected to genocide beyond belief; genocide which was planned to exterminate the whole Turkish people of the region to the last man, woman and child. Armenians tortured and massacred millions of defenseless civilians. To assemble innocent civilians in the mosques and burn them in the buildings was one of their methods.

Can anybody deny these facts?Jews killed Germans in WWII -- Germans killed Jews in WWII, BUT there was quite a difference in these two statements, regardless of what Nazi revisionists say![SY] My grand parents were living partly in todays Armenia and partly in[SY] todays Georgia. There were villages, Kurd/Turk (different Turkic groups)[SY] Georgian (muslim/christian) Armenian and Farsi... Very near to eachother.[SY] The people living there were aware of their differences. They were [SY] different people. For example, my grandfather would not have been happy [SY] if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian guy. But that did not [SY] mean that they were willing to kill eachother. No! They were neighbors.OK.[SY] Armenians killed Turks. Which Armenians? Their neoghbors? As far as my[SY] grandparents are concerned, the Armenians attacked first but these [SY] Armenians were not their neighbors. They came from other places. Maybe [SY] first they had a training at some place. They were taught to kill people,[SY] to hate Turks/Kurds? It seems so...There is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of theArmenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915, with that of the Armeno-Georgian conflicts of late 1918! The argument is not whether Armenians ever killed in their collective existence, but rather the wholesale destruction ofAnatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government. An Armenian-Georgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak, Lori, and Pambak afterthe Turkish Third Army evacuated the region, cannot be equated with theextermination of Anatolian Armenians. Many Armenians and Georgians diedin this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack ofpreparation for the winter months. This is not the same as the Turkish genocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier, hundreds of kilometersaway![SY] Anyway, but after they killed/raped/... Turks and other muslim people[SY] around, people assumed that 'Armenians killed us, raped our women',[SY] not a particular group of people trained in some camps, maybe backed[SY] by some powerful states... After that step, you cannot explain these [SY] people not to hate all Armenians. I don't follow, perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light.[SY] So what am I trying to point out? First, at least for that region,[SY] you cannot blame Turks/Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation.[SY] Most of the Armenians, I think, are not to blame either. But since some[SY] people started that fire, it is not easy to undo it. There are facts.[SY] People cannot trust eachother easily. It is very difficult to establish[SY] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with[SY] different ethnic/cultural/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately[SY] very easy to start a fire!Again, the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918/19 had little todo with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey. It is interesting thatthe Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia) made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through Tiflis on their way to Baku, in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians militarily. Of course, as Turkish troops marched across what was left ofCaucasian Armenia, many Armenians went north and such population movement caused problems with the locals. This is in no comparison with events 4 years earlier in eastern Anatolia. My father's mother's family escaped Cemiskezek -> Erzinka -> Erzerum -> Nakhitchevan -> Tiflis -> Constantinople -> Massachusetts. [SY] My grandparents were *not* bloodthirsty people. We did not experience[SY] what they had to endure... They had to leave their lands, there were[SY] ladies, old ladies, all of her children killed while she forced to[SY] witness! Young women put dirt at their face to make themselves[SY] unattractive! I don't want to go into any graphic detail.My grandmother's brother was forced to dress up as a Kurdish women, and pastepotato skins on his face to look ugly. The Turks would kill any Armenianyoung man on sight in Dersim. Because their family was rather influential,local Kurds helped them escape before it was too late. This is why I am alive today.[SY] You may think that my sources are biased. They were biased in some sense.[SY] They experienced their own pain, of course. That is the way it is.  But[SY] as I said they were living in peace with their neighbors before. Why [SY] should they become enemies?-- David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | "How do we explain Turkish troops onS.D.P.A.

I moved there fromNovosibirsk. My son entered the Baku Nautical School, and so I transferredto Azerbaijan. Later I met someone and married him, and now my name isArutunian, my husband's name . . .That there would be a massacre was not discussed openly, but there were hints and gibes, so to speak, at the Armenian people, and they were mocking the Russians, too. I was constantly aware of it at work, and not just this past year. I couldn't find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because I, I'll just say it, couldn't steal, couldn't deceive, and couldn't be involved in bribe-taking. And when I asked for decent working conditions they told me, "Leave, don't keep the others from working, you aren't cut out for this kind of work." And at work and around all the time I would hear gibes at the Armenians, like "The Turks had it right, they killed them all--the waythey've multiplied here they're making it hard for us to live," and "Things will be just fine if we get rid of them all." "No problem, the Turks will help," they say, "if we ask them, they'll rid Armenia of Armenians in half an hour." Well that's the way it all was, but I never thought, of course that it would spill over into a bloody tragedy, because you just couldn't imagine it. Here we've been living under the Soviet government for 70 years, and no one even considered such an idea possible.But I had been forming my own opinions, and in the presence of authoritative people I would often ask, "Where is this all leading, do people really not seewhat kind of situation is emerging here. The Russians are fleeing Sumgait, there are very few of them left. Why is no one dealing with this, what's goingon?" And when it all happened on the 27th and 28th, it became clear that everything had been arranged by someone, because what else are you to make of it if the First Secretary of the City Party Committee is marching ahead of thedemonstration with an Azerbaijani flag? I wouldn't be saying this now if I hadn't received personal confirmation from him later. Because when we were under guard in the SK club on the 1st, he came to the club, that Muslimzade. The women told me, "There he is, there he is, that's Muslimzade." I didn't believe the rumors that he had carried an Azerbaijani flag. I thought that they were just false rumors. I went over to him and said, "Are you the First Secretary of our City Party Committee?" He answers me, "Yes." And I ask him, "Tell me, did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an Azerbaijani flag, and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs, I don't know exactly what they said, but there was mention of Armenian blood?" And he tellsme, "Yes, I was there, but I tried to dissuade them from it." Then I asked himanother question: "And where were you when they were burning and slaughtering us? And he said, "I. . . We didn't know what to do, we didn't know, we didn't anticipate that that would happen in Sumgait."Comrade Mamedov, the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijani SSR, answered the same question for me: "No, we actually didn't anticipate the slaughter in Sumgait. At that time we were trying to contain the crowd of 45,000 in Baku that was preparing for a massacre." Those are his exact words, the ones he said in the office of the Council of Ministers of theArmenian SSR.And now, about the events themselves. Of course it's painful to discuss them, because it may seem that it's not true to someone else. Various rumors concerning what happened are making the rounds: some are true, others aren't. But unfortunately there are more true ones than false, because it was so horrible: in our age, here in the space age, the age of science, the age ofprogress, I don't know, if someone had told me this story, if I were living inor around Moscow, I wouldn't have believed it. Why not? Because it was really a genocide, it was a massacre. That's genuinely what it was.For example, on that day, the 28th--I didn't know about the 27th because my husband and I were both sick, both of us had the flu, and we were in bed--on the 28th our neighbor comes to our place and says, "You're in bed? You don't know anything about it? There was a demonstration in town, and after it they were overturning Armenian cars and burning them. They were looking into cars and asking, 'Are you an Armenian?' If they answered in Armenian, then they turned the car over and burned it." This isn't made up, the wife of the SeniorInvestigator of the Baku Ministry of Internal Affairs told us. He was returning home from his dacha with his wife, Raisa Sevastyanova, she's my neighbor. She immediately came and told LIS that they had landed right in the middle of it, I don't know what to call it, the cavalcade of automobiles they were stopping. He answered in Azerbaijani, they let them go, but they made himhonk the horn, they were kicking up a fracas. We didn't even believe it, and I said, "Certainly that didn't happen, how can that be?" And she said, "Muslimzade was leading the crowd, and the Sputnik store was completelysmashed because most of the salespeople there are Armenians. And when he saw that they had started breaking the glass in that store, he said, "Don't break the shop windows, don't destroy state property, but do whatever else you want." I didn't hear this with my own two ears, but it is a fact that the store wastorn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing Armenians although he's an Azerbaijani.While we were talking, all of a sudden right across from us . . . Sevastyanovais the first to look out the window and say, "Look, there's a crowd out there." And sure enough, when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had already started wrecking the neighboring building. There was an Armenian family there, a woman and two girls. They lived across from us. I'm sorry, I don't know the building number or the people's names, since we were in my husband's apartment, in Microdistrict 8, and I lived in Microdistrict No. 3. There was awful looting going on there at the time, the most hideous things were going on there then. One building there, ours, was attacked twice, once wasn't enough for them. They returned to the places where they hadn't finishedthe Armenians off. If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians, they beat the Azerbaijanis too. They also beat Russians, if it was Russians doing the hiding. Because there were Russians among them, they said so on television, there were people of various nationalities. But they didn't tell us why there were people of different nationalities. Because they wouldn't have touched the Azerbaijanis if they hadn't dared to stick up for the Armenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes.At the time I saw this from the window I was there, Sevastyanova was there, and so was my husband. We went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly off a balcony. All kinds of things, even a sofa. Then, when it was all down there, they burned it up. Then we saw the crowd, and they were all oohing. At first I couldn't figure out what was happening. And later I told my husband, "Lendrush, l think they're beating someone out there." And he answered, "I don't know, could be." Suddenly the crowd separated for a moment, and I saw it, and Raisa Sevastyanova saw it too. My husband had turned the other way, he didn't see it. I saw a naked girl with her hair down. They were dragging her. She kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her. She fell down, it was muddy there, and later other witnesses who saw it from their balconies told us, they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of blocks, as far as the mortgage bank, that's a good block and a half or two from here. I know this for sure because I saw it myself.Then the crowd rushed toward our building. We were standing there, and you canof course imagine what we were feeling. Were they going to kill us or not? AndI also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormentedthat woman, because I had just seen that.I asked my husband. I gave him an axe and said, "You kill me first, and then let them do what they want with the corpse." But our neighbors, it's true, defended us, they said, "There aren't any Armenians in our entryway, go away, only Muslims live here." Disaster missed us that time.But at two o'clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people, approximately, came back to our place. My husband was already asleep. He can sleep when he's upset about something, but I can't. I was standing, running from balcony to balcony. Our power was out, I don't remember for how long, but it was as though it had been deliberately turned off. There were no lights whatsoever, and I was glad, of course. I thought it was better that way. But then I look and the crowd is at our balcony. This was at 2:15 in the morning. The first time they were at our building it was 6:30, and now it was 2:15 in the morning. But I never thought that that old woman on the first floor, the Azerbaijani, was awake and watching out, there were human beings among them too. So she goes out with a pail of garbage, as though she needed to be takinggarbage out at two o'clock in the morning. She used it as a pretext and went toward those young people. They really were youngsters. From my balcony you could see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys. They spoke Azerbaijani. And when they came up to her she said, "What do you want?" And they answered, "We want the Armenian family that lives here" [pointing toward the second floor with their hands]. She says, "I already told you, we don't have any Armenians here, now leave, do you hear, this is an old Muslim woman talking to you," and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk aroundher and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away. And so they seemed to listen to her. They were all very young, they started apologizing and left. That was the second time death was at our door.I forgot to mention about one other apartment, a man named Rubik lives there, I don't know him really, I knew his daughter, I mean I saw her around, but we really didn't know them. But I do know that that guy who lives on the fourth floor across from our entryway went to Chernobyl and worked there for eight months, to earn money. Can you imagine what that means? He risked his life to earn X amount of money in order to better his family. He bought new furniture and was getting ready to give his daughter's hand in marriage, but, alas,everything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels. They threw everything out the windows, and the rest we saw from our balcony: how the neighbors on the left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that hadn't already been smashed or taken. What is one to think of that? It means that the parents in those families were in on it too. Unfortunately I came to be of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been foreseen in advance: both the beating of the Armenians and the stripping of apartments. Something on the order of "We'll move the Armenians out and take over their apartments."I have worked honestly my whole life, you can check everything about me. I came as a patriot from China, waited for nights on end in front of the Consulate General of the USSR, I came to my homeland as a patriot because I knew that the Party and the Komsomol were holy things. But when I saw in Sumgait that there wasn't anything holy about them, that Party membership was bought, that Komsomol members joined only for personal gain, that there were no ideals, no ideas, God save me, everything was being bought and sold, I saw all of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did.I can't talk any more about it . . . the image of that beating . . . When Iwent out of my own apartment--they picked us up under Soviet Army guard, they had arrived from all over to suppress that gang--not only Armenians, but some Russian families and their children, too, came out of their apartments andjoined us, because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with the situation the way it was. And what's interesting is that when we left on the buses I rode and thought that at least one group of people, for sure people would basically rise to the situation, would have some compassion for the Armenians, would somehow understand the injustice of what was done. But having analyzed and weighed the whole thing, once I calmed down, having thought it all through, I came to a conclusion that is shared by many people. If a lot of Azerbaijanis didn't want their Armenian neighbors to be killed, and that basically depended on that Muslimzade--he said that he had wanted to calm them down--then is it possible that he didn't have people at hand to whomhe could whisper at the last minute, "Go and announce it on television: Citizens of Sumgait! Take what you can into your hands, let's protect our neighbors from this massacre?" Those crowds weren't such that there was no controlling them. Basically they were unarmed. They didn't have firearms, mostly they had knives, they had all kinds of metal parts, like armature shafts, sharpened at the ends, special rocks, different to a degree that we noticed them: there aren't rocks like those in Sumgait soils, they were brought from somewhere, as though it were all specially planned. So as I was saying, I weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend us, why wasn't it arranged? It means that the government didn't want to do it. When the crowd was moving from the City Party Committee to the Sputnik, what, there was no way of informing Baku? No, there was no way, it turns out!The crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict. I won't mention the things I didn't see myself, I'll only talk about the things I myself witnessed. They were in Microdistrict 8 beginning at 6 o'clock in the evening, when I saw themfrom the other building, and they were somewhere else until mid-night or one o'clock in the morning, because at 2:15 they came back to our building. Theyhadn't completely finished making their predatory rounds of Microdistrict 8. When they returned to our building I told my husband, "Lendrush, now the police are probably going to come, my God, now the authorities are probably going to find out and come to our aid." Well, alas, no, there were to be no authorities, not a single policeman, not a single fireman, not a single ambulance came while they were raging, as it turns out, as we later found out,beginning on the Might of the 27th. There were dead people, ruined apartments,and burned autos: one car near the bus station, it was burned and overturned, it was probably there about four days, everyone saw it and what went on in Block 45! Those who live there know, they saw from their balconies how they attacked the soldiers in the buses, how they beat those poor, unarmedsoldiers, and how on that square, I can't remember the name of it, where thereis that fork coming from the bus station, that intersection, now I'm upset andI can't think of the name . . . there's a tall building there, a 9-story, and from the balconies there people saw that butchery, when the poor soldiers, wearing only helmets, with shields and those unfortunate clubs, moved against that mob. And when they fell, those 12-to 14-year-old boys ran up and using stones, big heavy stones, beat them to death on their heads. Who could have guessed that something like that could happen in the Soviet Union and under the Soviet government? The upshot is that this republic has not been under Soviet control for a long time, but no one wanted to pay any attention or get involved.If you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that I tell thetruth, I've been struggling for truth for five years there already, the five years that I worked at the Azerbaijani railroad. Some people there considered me a demagogue, others who knows what; some think I'm an adventure seeker, andsome, a prankster. But I wanted everything to be right, I would becomeoutraged: how can this be, why is it people treat one another this way on a Soviet railroad, as though the Azerbaijani railroad were Azerbaijani property,or the property of some magnate, or some "mafia": If I want to, I'll get you out of here; If I want to, I'll get rid of you; If I want to, I'll do something else? And there's a black market price for everything, in the most brazen way: a coach to Moscow costs so much, a coach on a local train costs somuch. Once when I was complaining to the head of the conductor's pool, he had the nerve to tell me, maybe you won't even believe this, but this, I'm afraid,I heard with my own ears: "Tatyana, just how long can you fight for somethingthat you know will never have any effect? You're alone against everyone, so instead why don't you give more money to the chief conductor, and everything will go fine for you." I started to cry, turned, and left. What else could I do, where else could I go to complain? I realized that everything was useless.And the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to seeit. I filed a written complaint, and they ground it into dust, they destroyed it, I still have a copy, but what's the use? When the General Procuracy got involved with the investigation of the bloody Sumgait affair, in addition to the information about what I saw, what I was a witness to, I gave testimony about the mafia at the railroad. They accepted my petition, but I don't know if they're going to pursue it or not. Because, you'll excuse me, I no longer believe in the things I aspired to, the things I believed in before: It's all dead. They just spit on my soul, stomped on everything, physically, and most important, spiritually, because you can lose belongings, that's nonsense, thatall comes with time, but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in you--your beliefs--are destroyed, it can be very difficult to restore them...I want to tell of one incident. I just don't know, at the time I was in such astate that I didn't even take minor things into account. Here is an example.Of course, it's not a minor one. My neighbor, Raisa Sevastyanova, she has ason, Valery, who is in the 9th grade in a school in Microdistrict 8. A boy,Vitaly [Danielian], I don't know his last name, goes to school with him, orrather, went to school with him. I was just sitting in an apartment trying tomake a phone call to Moscow . . . Oh yes, and there's one important detail:When the massacre began, for two to three hours the phones weren't working in Armenian apartments, and later, in several Russian and Azerbaijani apartments.But the fact of the matter is that service was shut off, you could not call anywhere. Why? Again, it means it was all planned. How come service is cut offfor no reason? And the lights went off. And those brats were raging as theyliked They weren't afraid, they ran about freely, they that no one would slap their hands and no one would dare to stop them.  They knew it.Now I'm going to tell about the incident. So this little Vitaly, Vitalik, anArmenian boy, went to school with Valery; they were in the same class. According to what Valery and his neighbor pal said--at the time I was in thesame apartment as they were, I sat at the phone waiting for the call to be putthrough--a mob attacked the building where Vitalik lived. So Valery ran tohis mother and said, "Mamma, please let me go to Vitalik's, what if they killhim? Maybe he's still alive, maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow.. . . He's a nice guy, we all like him, he's a good person, he's smart." His mother wouldn't let him go. In tears, she says, "Valery, you can't go because I am afraid." He says, "Mamma, we can get around the crowd. We'll just watch, just have a look." They made it through. I don't know, I think Vitalik'sparents lived in Microdistrict No. 1, and when they got there, they made a superficial deduction. Knowing that balconies and doors were being broken everywhere, that you could see from the street which were the Armenian apartments in the building, they went here and there and looked, and saw that the windows were intact, and so they calmed down. But even though the windows in that apartment were not broken, everything inside was totally smashed, and Vitalik lay there with a broken skull, and his mother and father had already been murdered. Little Vitalik didn't even know they were dead. So two weeks ago, I don't know, he was in critical condition, no, maybe it was longer: we left Sumgait on March 20, spent some time in Moscow, and then we came to Yerevan. So it's been about a month already; it's so hard to keep all this straight. So Valery, the next day, when he found out that Vitalik's family hasbeen killed and Vitalik was ling in the Semashko Hospital in Baku, Valery andhis classmates got together and went to visit him. But they wouldn't admit them, telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in a coma. They cried and left, having also found out that the girl I saw being kicked and dragged was in that hospital too. As it turns out she was brought there in serious condition, but at least she was alive at the time . . .When we got to the SK club we would see first one friend and then another, throw ourselves into their arms and kiss them, because you had wondered if these friends were alive or not, if those friends were alive or not  . . . Andwhen you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived! Whenyou saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end.If you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book. A book of things it is even difficult to believe. And those two girls who were raped were entirely black and blue, the ones at the SK, they know I'm not lying, that girlfriend came up to one of them and said, "What happened?" and she bared her breasts, and they were completely covered in cigarette burns . . . those rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts. After something like that I don't know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it.Now . . . When we stayed at the military unit for a while, they provided,well, basic conditions for us there. The military unit is located in Nasosny,some six miles from Sumgait. And living there we met with a larger groupof people. There were about 1,600 people at the unit. You know, there was apoint when I couldn't even go outside because if you went outside you sawso much heartbreak around you. And when you hear the false rumors . . .Yes, by the way, false rumors were spread in Sumgait saying that the Armeniansaround Yerevan had destroyed Azerbaijani villages and razed them to the groundwith bulldozers. I didn't know whether to believe it or not. And people who don't know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge. But when I arrived in Armenia and was in Spitak, and in Spitak all those villages are not only intact, but at that time had even been protected just in case, they were guarded, they got better food than did the inhabitants of Spitak. Not a single person there died, and no one is planning to harm them. Around Yerevan all the villages are safe and unharmed, and the Armenians didn't attack anyone. But actually, after an evil of the magnitude suffered in Sumgait therecould have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. And I don'tknow why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are guilty, that it is they who organized it. Rumors like that are being spread inAzerbaijan. And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, they notonly perceive it with their minds, but with their hearts, too. To them it seems that the older person is telling the truth. For example, one says; "Did you know that out of 31 people killed (by the way, originally they said 31 people, but later they found a 32nd), 30 were Azerbaijani and one was an Armenian?"Of course I'm upset, but it's utterly impossible to discuss such things andnot become upset. Sometimes l forget things, but I know I want to return tothe time when we were in the SK club across from the City Party Committee.When I saw Muslimzade in the SK club building I went to him to ask because I couldn't believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner. I alreadymentioned this, and if I repeat anything, please excuse me. I asked him, "Why did you do that and why are you here now, why did you come here? To laugh at these women who are strewn about on the floor?" The overcrowding there was tremendous, it was completely unsanitary, and several of the children werealready sick. It's true the troops tried to make it livable for us. They cooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food, but the thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at it everywhere, that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere. Plus they were never given any direct orders, they didn't know what they were authorizedto do and not to do. And it was only on March 8 at five o'clock in the eveningthat Krayev himself, the Lieutenant General, the City Commandant of Sumgait, was given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored personnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do, as his heart advised him, and relocate people to the military unit.But that's not what I want to talk about now. Muslimzade, characteristically, tried to get me out of the SK building and take me to the City PartyCommittee, which is across the square from the club. He took me by thehand and said, "Citizen, don't worry, we'll go and have a talk in my office.I told him, "No, after everything you've done, I don't believe one iota of what you say. If I go to the City Party Committee I'll disappear, and the traces of me will disappear too. Because you can't stand it when . . . " Oh yes, and there was another interesting detail from that meeting. It was even very funny, although at the time I wasn't up to laughing. He was in a nice, expensive hat, and so as to put him to shame, so to speak, I said, "Oh, why did you come here all duded up like a London dandy, you smell of good perfume,you're in your starched shirt, and you have your expensive hat on. You cameto ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor, who arealready getting sick, whose relatives have died. Did you come to laugh atthem?" And the one who was accompanying him, an Azerbaijani, I don't know who he was or what his title was, he quickly snatched the hat off Muslimzade's head and hid it. Then I said, "My God! We're not marauders. We're not you! We didn't come to you with the intention of stealing!" "Well kill me, kill me!" Muslimzade says to me, "But I'm not guilty . . . kill me, kill me, but I'm notguilty." And I say, "OK, fine, you're not guilty, have it your way. But give us an answer, we're asking you: Where were you when they were torturing and raping those poor women, when they were killing the children, burning things, carrying on outrageously, and wrecking all those apartments? Where were you then?" "You know, we didn't expect it, we did not know what to do, we didn't anticipate that something like that would happen in Sumgait." I started laughing and said, "It's truly funny." He says, "What could I do? We didn't know what to do." And I say, "I'm sorry, but it'll be ridiculous if I tell you: The First Secretary of the City Party Committee shouldn't march out in front with a banner; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross over his dead body. That's what you should have done. That's the way it was during the war. Not a single party committee secretary compromised himself;either he died or he led people into battle. And what did you do? You ran away, you left, you hid, you marched with a flag, because you were afraid, excuse my language, you feared for your own damned hide. And when we ask you, you tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done? That's right," I told him, "the City party committee got confused, all the party committees got confused, the police got confused,. Baku got confused, they all lay in a faint for two weeks, and the gang ran the show with impunity. And if it weren't for the troops it wouldn't have been just two days, there wouldn't be a single Armenian left in Sumgait for sure, they would have finished their bloody affair, because they brazenly went up to some Russians, too, the ones who tried to say something to them, and they told them, 'As soon as we finish with the Armenians we'll come after you, too."And by the way, there was a colonel, who took us to the military unit. He wasthe one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours laterarrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the  SK and took us tothe military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit. We asked him, "What? How? What will come of us?" He openly said, "You know, for us the main thing now is to catch that gang. We'll finish that quickly. You'llstay at the military unit for the time being, and we'll decide later." The General Procuracy of the USSR arrived, it consists of investigators from all cities. There were some from Stavropol, from everywhere, just everywhere, because the affair was truly frightful. About this, by the way, Comrade Katusev spoke;as everyone knows, he's the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR. When he gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit, by the way, he told us the honest truth, because he couldn't not say it, because he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen, and he said, "There was Afghanistan; and it was bad, but Sumgait--it'shorrible! And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely punished, in accordance with our laws." And that's a quote. Then one mother throws herself at him--her two sons had died before her very eyes--and says,"Who will return my sons? Who is going to punish the [culprits]?" They tried to calm her down, and he said, "In order for us to conduct a proper investigation, in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility, you must help us, because we don't know, maybe there was someone else in the gang who is now being concealed in homes, and maybe the neighbors know, maybe someone saw something. Don't be afraid, write about it in detail. So that you're not afraid . . . Everyone knows that many of you are afraid, having lived through such horrors, they think that if they write the whole truth about, let's say, their neighbor or someone else, that they will seek revenge later. We're going to do it like this: We're going to set up an urn and you can throw what you write in there. We don't need to know who wrote it. The names of the people who write won't be made public, but we need all theinformation. Let each and every one not be afraid, let each write what is necessary, who they saw in that gang, who made threats or shouted threatening gibes about the Armenians . . . You must describe all of these people and put the information into the urn."Two soldiers and a major guarded the urn. And, sure enough, many people, people who didn't even want to write . . .I know one woman who asked me, she came up and said, "You, as a Russian, the same thing won't happen to you as will happen to me. So please . . . I'll give you the information, and you please write it down for me." So she was afraid, and there were a lot likeher . . . But later, after Katusev made his speech, she sat and wrote downeverything she knew. And we threw it all into the urn. Now we don't know if it will be of any use. For a factual picture will emerge from all that information. One person can lie, but thousands can't lie, thousands simply can't lie. You have to agree with that, a fact is a fact. Why, for example, should someone say that black is white if it is really black?   The First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the AzerbaijaniSSR, Mamedov, as I said, was in Yerevan. My husband and I were at the Council of Ministers of the Armenian SSR and found out that Mamedov was present, the one who had come to convince the people of Sumgait to  return to their previous dwellings, to their old apartments. We asked for a meeting with him, and it was granted. When we went to see him he tried to behave properly, very politely, delicately, but . . . when the truth was told right to his face and when I asked him some of the same questions I had asked Muslimzade, "Where wereyou personally when they were beating us? Now you're trying to convince us to return, why didn't you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where it was all leading?" he says, "You're telling the truth. Let's not mince words. You've told me right to my face, and I'll tell you straight. I'll tell you the pure truth. I was gotten out of bed in the evening, the whole government was up, including me, and we were restraining a crowd of about 45,000 in Baku. But we never expected that in a city like Sumgait, with its fine international record, such a thing could happen. We expected it in Baku."I say, "So that means you expected it all the same? Why were you expecting it?" And he says, "You know, it just happened that way. We were expecting it in Baku, we were trying to restrain it, but in Sumgait . . . " I say, "Fine, you didn't know for the first three or four hours, but then you should have known. Why did no one help us?" And he says, "Well, OK, we didn't know what todo" and things like that. Basically it was the same story I got from Muslimzade. Later, when he said, "You go on back, the situation in Sumgait is favorable now, everything is fine, the Armenians are friendly with the Azerbaijanis . . . " To this l answered, "You know what . . . I'm speaking with you as a [member of a] neutral nation . . . I have never argued with Armenians or with Azerbaijanis and I was an eyewitness . . . You tell me, please, Comrade Mamedov, " I asked him, "What would you say about thishonestly, if you were being completely frank with us?" Then he said, "Yes, I admit that I am honestly ashamed, shame on the entire Azerbaijani nation, we have disgraced ourselves not only before the entire Soviet Union, but before the whole world. Because now the Voice of America and all the other foreign radio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors, too."And I say, "There's nothing to add to what really happened. I don't think it'spossible to add anything more awful." He says, "Yes, I agree with you, I understand your pain, it is truly an unfortunate occurrence." I repeat that hesaid "unfortunate occurrence." And then he suddenly remembered himself, what he was saying--he had a pen in his hands, he was fidgeting with it nervously--and said, "Oh, excuse me, a tragedy, really . . . " I take this to mean that he really thinks it's an "unfortunate occurrence." "And of course," he says, "I understand that having gone through all this you can't return to Sumgait, but it's necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being tried." And he even gave a detail, which, I don't know if it matters or not, that 160 policemen were being tried. Specifically in relation to that bloody affair.Yes, by the way, there is another good detail, how I was set up at work inBaku after the events. I went to an undergarment plant, there was an Azerbaijani working there, and suddenly she tells me, "What, they didn'tnail your husband? They screwed up." I was floored, I hadn't imagined thatanyone in Baku, too, could say something like that. Well after that I went upto see . . . to my office, I needed to find out about those days, what wasgoing to happen with them, how they were going to put down those days from February 29 to March 10 . . . and the administrator told me, "I don't know, Tatyana, go to the head of the conductors' pool. Be grateful if they don't put it down as unexcused absence." I was really discouraged by this. They all know that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived, and here they're telling me that I was skipping work, as though I was off enjoying myself somewhere. I went to the office of the chief of the pool, his last nameis Rasulov, and he's had that position for many years. Incidentally, he's a Party member, and is a big man in town. And suddenly, when I went to him and said, "Comrade Rasulov, this is the way it was . . . " He looked at me askanceand said, "And why are you"--he knows me by my previous last name--"why didyou get wrapped up in this mess?" I say, "What do you mean, why did I get wrapped up in this mess? My husband's an Armenian," I tell him, "I have an Armenian last name." And he screwed up his face, made a kind of a grimace, as though he had eaten something sour, and said, "I didn't expect that you would. . . " What did he mean by that? And "how" should he behave, the chief of thepool, a man who supervises 1,700 workers? Now, it's true, there was a reduction, but for sure there are still 1,200 conductors working for him. And if someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that, then what can you expect from a simple, uneducated, politically unsophisticated person?!He's going to believe any and all rumors, that the Armenians are like this, the Armenians are like that, and so on . . .By the way, that Mamedov--now I'm going back to Mamedov's office when I asked him "Are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return to Sumgait?" he answered, "Yes, you know, I would guarantee them . . . I don'twant to take on too much, I would guarantee them firmly for 50 years. But I won't guarantee them for longer than 50 years." I say, "So you've got anotherthing like that planned for 50 years from  now? So they'll be quiet and then in another 50 years it'll happen again?!" I couldn't contain myself any more,and I also told him, "And how did it get to that point, certainly you knewabout it, how they were treating the Russians, for example, in Baku and in Sumgait, how they were hounded from their jobs? Certainly you receivedcomplaints, I wrote some myself. Why did no one respond to them? Why did everyone ignore what was going on? Didn't you prepare people for this by the way you treated them?" And he says, "You know, you're finally starting to insult me!" He threw his pen on the desk. "Maybe now you'll say I'm a scoundrel too?" I say, "You know, I'm not talking about you because I don't know. But about the ones who I do know I can say with conviction, yes, that comrade was involved in this, that, and that, because I know for certain."Well anyway he assured us that here, in Yerevan, there were false rumors, that 3,000 Sumgait Armenians were here, and 15,000 were in Sumgait and had gotten back to work. Everyone was working, he said, and life was very good. "We drove about the town ourselves, Comrade Arutiunian [First Secretary of the Communist Party of Armenia SSR] came from the Council of Ministers of Armenian, he came and brought information showing that everything was fine inSumgait." When I asked Mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said, '"Well, I walked down the street." And I said, "Walking down the street in any city, even if I were to go to New York, I would never understand the situationbecause I would be a guest, I don't have any contact with people, but if you spend 10 days among some blue-collar workers in such a way that they didn't know you were the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, you'd hear something quite different." I told him, for example, that I drew my conclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments. They tookus all in turns to pick things up, since people had fled to the military unit;they got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible. How are the neighbors in the microdistrict, how will they view us, what do they think? I thought maybe that in fact it wasn't something general, of a mass nature, someanti-national something. And when that bus took us to our building, because itwas the same bus, while we were going up to our apartment, an armed soldier accompanied us. What does that say? It speaks of the fact that if everything there were fine, why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back withus, going from apartment to apartment? And in fact, especially with the young people, you could sense the delight at our misfortune, the grins, and they were making comments, too. And that was in the presence of troops, when policedetachments were in the microdistricts and armored personnel carriers and tanks were passing by. And if people are taking such malicious delight when the situation is like that, then what is it going to be like when they withdraw protection from the city altogether? There will be more outrages, of course, perhaps not organized, but in the alleys . . .

Lambrou) writes:>What about Cyprus?? The majority of the population is christian, but >your fellow Turkish friends DID and STILL DOING a 'good' job for you >by cleaning the area from christians.All your article reflects is your abundant ignorance. The people of Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to theparties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July 15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop Makarios.Following the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with the aid of the Greek army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right given by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently and conveniently forgotten people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For those Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island since 1571. The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organizationof Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should notforget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turksin Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried todestroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Ofcourse, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences for this irresponsible conduct.            THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM2 Irfan Bey Street, Kumsal Area, Nicosia, CyprusIt is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major who  was serving atthe Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launchedagainst the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. NihatIlhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutallykilled in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savageGreeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocitiescommitted during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house whichhas been converted into a museum.AN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BYGREEK TERRORISTSThe date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of theGreeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has beengoing on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old menand children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now KumsalArea of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savagebloodshed...The wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, amajor on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent,are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  thebathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into theirhome. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.Let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told byMr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was woundedduring the same terrible event."On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasanand I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan.Our neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs.Ayshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sittinghaving supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos Riverdirection started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain.Thinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  wasdangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thoughtwould be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid inthe bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. Wewaited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standingin the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in herarms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open.Greeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the housewith  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heardvoices saying, in  Greek, "You want Taksim eh!"  and then bulletsstarted flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three childrenfell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks,who broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. Iheard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted.When I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan andher three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of theneighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But whathad happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran tothe  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  wasbrutally murdered.In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying"Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?"  I became terrified. Ithought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was notdead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myselfunder the double-bed.An our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. Mymouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank somewater. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to thebathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There Ioffered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber whowere all wounded.We  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  Ithought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and neededto be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novberand I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walkedas far as Koshklu Chiftlik.There, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we wereoperated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that therewere more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs.Ayshe and her daughter.After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane toAnkara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  monthstreatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus,Greeks arrested me at the Airport.All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during mydetention. They then released me."ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTERWe went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia inwhich 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last fivedays.We  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  someterrible sights.In the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our wayinto  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  Achild's bicycle lay in a corner.In the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were threechildren piled on top of their murdered mother.In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in thehead.This, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whosefamily had been killed by the mob in the first violence.Today was five days later, and still they lay there.Rene MacCOLL and Daniel McGEACHIE, (From the "DAILY EXPRESS")"...I saw in  a bathroom the bodies of a  mother and three infantchildren murdered because their father was a Turkish Officer..."Max CLOS, LE FIGARO 25-26 January, 1964 Peter Moorhead reporting from the village of Skyloura, Cyprus.  Date : 1 January, 1964.  IL GIARNO (Italy)  THEY ARE TURK-HUNTING, THEY WANT TO EXTERMINATE THEM. Discussions start in London; in Cyprus terror continues. Right now we are witnessing the exodus of Turks from the villages. Thousands of people abandoning homes, land, herds; Greek Cypriot terrorism is relentless. This  time, the rhetoric of the Hellenes and the bust of Plato do not suffice to  cover up barbaric and ferocious behaviors. Article by Giorgo Bocca, Correspondent of Il Giorno Date: 14 January 1964 DAILY HERALD (London) AN APPALLING SIGHTAnd when I came across the Turkish homes they were an appalling sight.Apart from the walls, they just did not exist. I doubt if a napalm bombattack could have created more devastation. I counted 40 blackened brickand concrete shells that had once been homes. Each house had been deliberatelyfired by petrol. Under red tile roofs which had caved in, I found a twistedmass of bed springs, children's conts and cribs, and ankle deep greyashes of what had once been chairs, tables and wardrobes.In the neighbouring village of Ayios Vassilios, a mile away, I counted 16 wrecked and burned out homes. They were all Turkish Cypriot homes. Fromthis village more than 100 Turkish Cypriots had also vanished.In neither villagedid I find a scrap of damage to any Greek Cypriot house. DAILY TELEGRAPH (London)  GRAVES OF 12 SHOT TURKISH CYPRIOTS FOUND IN CYPRUS VILLAGE Silent crowds gathered tonight outside the Red Crescent hospital in the Turkish Sector of Nicosia, as the bodies of 9 Turkish Cypriots found crudely buried outside the village of Ayios Vassilios, 13 miles away, were brought to the hospital under the escort of the Parachute Regiment. Three  more bodies, including one of a woman, were discovered nearby but could not be removed. Turkish Cypriots guarded by paratroops are still trying to  locate the bodies of 20 more believed to have been buried on the same site.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists                             a single Turkish soul.' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)

If you just look at attackson villages then there is no way of deciding when it started. Would youcount the riots in the 20's and 30's? Violence but not war. I personallythink that 'war', as opposed to civil disturbance or whatever, requiresorganisation, planning and some measure of regualr or semi-regular forces.Perhaps the Arab Liberation Army counts. I could easily be convinced it wasso. From what I know they did not have a great deal of planning let aloneorganisation. The Haganah and Palmach certainly did. That is not a causefor criticism, it merely reflects the great organisation generally in the'Zionist' camp.>Of course, this isn't war, since it's only the Arabs attacking.Now you are being silly aren't you?

They were attacking the Iraqis to drive them out of Kuwait,a country whose citizens have close blood and business tiesto Saudi citizens.  And me thinks if the US had not helped outthe Iraqis would have swallowed Saudi Arabia, too (or at least the eastern oilfields).  And no Muslim country was doingmuch of anything to help liberate Kuwait and protect SaudiArabia; indeed, in some masses of citizens were demonstratingin favor of that butcher Saddam (who killed lotsa Muslims),just because he was killing, raping, and looting relativelyrich Muslims and also thumbing his nose at the West.So how would have *you* defended Saudi Arabia and rolledback the Iraqi invasion, were you in charge of Saudi Arabia???>Fatwah is as legitimate as this one.

(In yourclarinet posting you edited out some stuff; was it the following???)Friday's New York Times reported that this group definitely ismore conservative than even Sheikh Baz and his followers (whothink that the House of Saud does not rule the country conservativelyenough).  The NYT reported that, besides complaining that thegovernment was not conservative enough, they have:- asserted that the (approx. 500,000) Shiites in the Kingdom  are apostates, a charge that under Saudi (and Islamic) law  brings the death penalty.    Diplomatic guy (Sheikh bin Jibrin), isn't he Ilyess?- called for severe punishment of the 40 or so women who  drove in public a while back to protest the ban on  women driving.  The guy from the group who said this,  Abdelhamoud al-Toweijri, said that these women should  be fired from their jobs, jailed, and branded as  prostitutes.  Is this what you want to see happen, Ilyess?  I've  heard many Muslims say that the ban on women driving  has no basis in the Qur'an, the ahadith, etc.  Yet these folks not only like the ban, they want  these women falsely called prostitutes?    If I were you, I'd choose my heroes wisely,  Ilyess, not just reflexively rally behind  anyone who hates anyone you hate.- say that women should not be allowed to work.- say that TV and radio are too immoral in the Kingdom.Now, the House of Saud is neither my least nor my most favorite governmenton earth; I think they restrict religious and political reedom a lot, amongother things.  I just think that the most likely replacementsfor them are going to be a lot worse for the citizens of the country.But I think the House of Saud is feeling the heat lately.  In thelast six months or so I've read there have been stepped up harassingby the muttawain (religious police---*not* government) of Western womennot fully veiled (something stupid for women to do, IMO, because itsends the wrong signals about your morality).  And I've read thatthey've cracked down on the few, home-based expartiate religiousgatherings, and even posted rewards in (government-owned) newspapersoffering money for anyone who turns in a group of expartiates whodare worship in their homes or any other secret place. So thegovernment has grown even more intolerant to try to take some ofthe wind out of the sails of the more-conservative opposition.As unislamic as some of these things are, they're just a smalltaste of what would happen if these guys overthrow the House ofSaud, like they're trying to in the long run.Is this really what you (and Rached and others in the generalwest-is-evil-zionists-rule-hate-west-or-you-are-a-puppet crowd)want, Ilyess?--Dave Bakken==>"the President is doing a fine job, but the problem is we don't know what    to do with her husband."

The reasons are pragmatic: even if>Bosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under>Turkish rule centuries ago, none of the present generation has any>clue what was their ancestor's actual nationality.  In fact, althoughI am forced to disagree with you. First of all, one may have been born from a non-Turkish, non-Muslim parent outside the Turkish land, yet still can be a Turk, provided this person calls himself or herself a Turk. Because the designation of a Turk is not a genetic feature,not a racial or religious feature. It is a matter of identifyingwith the Turkish values. Secondly, the following observations by Westerners were written in French by Ahmet Cevat: "If Turks had behaved like Christians to use force to convert to Islam thenations which they brought under their power, to which no one could haveopposed, today there would be no Eastern problem. But Turks did not do so. They obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody "to worship in their ownway" centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum. Thus,in an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when people in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefsdiffered from theirs, the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where theinquisition did not exist, where deaths at the stake were unheard of and where accusations of witchcraft were not made. And the barbarian (!) Turkeywas the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhereby the Christians, could find asylum. These facts demonstrate that Muslimcountries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christiancountries."[1]"The Turks, who are a conquering nation, did not Turkify the nations that cameunder their rule; instead, they respected their religions and traditions. Itwas a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead ofRussian or Austrian rule. Because otherwise there would not have been aRomanian nation today" (Popescu Ciocanel)."Turks rule over people under their administration only externally, withoutinterfering with their internal structures. On account of this, the autonomyof minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the mostadvanced European countries."[2]"...human beings hate each other on account of religious differences. This flawis older than Islam and Christianity. But there has never been any examplesof this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on accountof his religion. If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case ofsimple contempt among us too, or if it did not keep translating itself intoaction, many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselveshappy!" (A. de Mortraye).[3]"Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of theinquisition. On the contrary, it served as an asylum for the unfortunatevictims of Christian fanaticism. If you look into history, you will see thatin the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain andPortugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have beenliving there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years,and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against thecruelty of Christians, especially that of the Orthodoxes. No Jew is able toappear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens, even today. In Turkey,however, if the Israelites are insulted by the Greek and Armenian communities,local courts immediately take them under their protection.""In that vast and calm country of the sultan, all religions and nations areliving together peacefully. Although the mosque is superior to the church andthe synagogue, it does not replace them. Because of this, the Catholic sect ismore free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon. In addition to the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this sect, neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. While thedead are being taken to the graves, a long line of priests bear processionalcandles and chant Catholic hymns. When all the priests in all the churches inthe Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clericalprocessions during the Eucharist celebrations, chanting hymns and bearingtheir crosses and religious banners, a detachment of soldiers escorts themwhich forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of priests."

ButI strongly dispute your notion that Croats had a similar older agenda,in fact, for the past century or two, Croats and Muslims have seenthemselves as having a lot in common, and they generally had friendlyrelations.  Your suggestion that Croat-Muslim relationship is anything like Serb-Muslim relationship is completely wrong.To say that Croats and Muslims have a lot in common does not implythey are not separate peoples.  The events of the past two yearsclearly show Muslim determination to remain separate: in their alliancewith Croats, they maintained this separation.  Croats would haveaccepted a much closer relationship, I think.  This century plusof building bridges between these two friendly peoples is now atrisk, because of the inexorable logic of war.  Since Bosnian Serbs (32% of population) have 10 times more heavyweapons than Bosnian Muslims (44%) and Croats (17%) combined, theyhave squeezed Muslims and Croats into only 30% of the territory.Muslims lost more territory than Croats (who built defenses early on).Under these conditions, any alliance is bound to fall apart sinceit is easier to recover lost land from Croats than from Serbs.The only thing keeping this in check was the hope of reversal offortunes through foreign military intervention and lifting of thearms embargo.  Since Warren Christopher had no luck persuadingthe Europeans to go along with this, this hope was dashed.  Havingno prospect of outside help, the former allies turned on each other,like two starved animals in a tight cage.This inexorable logic, of course, got plenty of help from Serbianintelligence operatives, who were doing everything to buildmistrust between Croats and Muslims for over a year.  A timelyintervention to stop Serbian aggression would have prevented this.Sadly, nothing was done to create a balance of power on theground.  As long as the Serbs enjoy 10:1 advantage, they can break any alliance, even among friends.  This is tragic, buthardly new: "divide et impera" was used by ancient Romanswith success.  In my view, Bosnian Muslims and Croats managedto resist this divisive strategy reasonably well until May 9, 1993,when the hope of reversal of fortunes was lost.  I have a question for the distinguished diplomats: do theybelieve Balkan peoples are experimental cannon fodder?  I'd like to knowwhat did they expect when they decided to enforce the arms embargo whichsolidified Serbian 10:1 advantage in heavy weapons; how did they expectto prevent fragmentation of the Muslim and Croat defense forces;  and howon Earth do they hope to restore peace without justice?The implications of this immoral approach I cannot begin to predict,but I am filled with foreboding...Sincerely,Josip

No Arab State is and canclaim to be democratic. No Arab state claims to be democratic.I am born in Palestine (now Israel). I have family there. The lack ofpeace and utter injustice in my home country has affected me all my life.I am concerned by Palestine (Israel) because I want peace to come toit. Peace AND justice. If anybody has legitimate claims towards Arab states, he should presenthis claims and ask for support. Jews who left Arab states are fully entitled to make claims and should do so, if they consider their case hasa merit. It is their basic right to return to these countries, if theywish. If not, they should not complain and compare themselves to thePalestinians who have been struggling for the right of return sinceIsrael was established and whose right is upheld by the United Nationsquasi totally. If Jews feel discriminated in Arab countries, they have alegitimate claim that any decent person can and should support. Human rights violations by Arab States don't justify, legitimate norare the cause for Israeli breaches of international law and human rioghts.Israeli breaches stem from the Zionist concept, which can only beimplemented by negating basic rights to Palestinians. Israeli trights and Palestinian rights are not symmetrical. The firstparty has a state and the other has none. The first is an occupier andthe second the occupied. For any meaningful relationship to emerge, somesymmetry must be established. As long as Israelis and Jews don't realisethe necessity of a change of perspective towards the Palestinian peopleand as long as Israelis and Jews don't want to exorcise their ownpast towards the Palestinians (the Naqba of 1948, etc.) and refuse toacknowledge that the creation of Israel was dependent upon the removalof most Palestinian Arabs, there will be no base for a real trust.When I read the first time the list of the 383 Arab villagesdestroyed by the State of Israel in and after 1948, I got a shock. I hope others will be touched by this discovery and think about themeaning of such massive destruction and destitution.Elias DavidssonIceland

Dec. 1989Leading Israeli author and cultural commentator, A.B. Yehoshua,launched a ferocious attack on diaspora Jewry at a Zionist YouthCouncil meeting in North London, last week.The diaspora, he claimed, "was the cancer connected to the maintissue of the Jewish people". He was scathing about its failure toact before the Holocaust.He said the diaspora's religious and secular leadership hadignored the warning signs in the 1920s, and had fiercely opposedZionism. Consequently, he considered the Holocaust, "the failureof Judaism".His talk, entitled "Diaspora: A Neurotic Solution", covered 5,000years of Jewish history.Mr. Yehoshua's other targets included Soviet Jews who were, hesaid "not staying [in Israel], but running [away]", and all Jewsoutside Israel "who were using other people's countries likehotels".The only conclusion he could draw was that the diaspora wasimmoral, because it looked to Israel for its identity but livedelsewhere.Worse, it threatened Israel itself, creating a distraction for hercitizens, who were leaving by the thousands.Mr. Yehoshua, who described himself as "a soldier for aliyah",ended by calling for the creation of a new "total Jew", living inIsrael.Earlier, speaking at a meeting of Jewish students on thedifficulties of forging a national identity in Israeli literature,Mr. Yehoshua claimed that Israeli writers were paralyzed by thecountry's political situation.He said Israel's wars had once provided writers with a vitalsource of inspiration.  Today, Israeli writers avoided writingdirectly about the Arab-Israeli conflict. No major work had beenproduced about the intifada.Instead, writers were tackling themes such as Jewish identity,emigration from Israel and personal and family issues.Mr. Yehoshua admitted he also felt unable to write about theIsraeli political situation. He could no longer step into anIsraeli Arab's shoes and portray him as a real "flesh and bloodcharacter".He claimed that after 40 years of statehood, the problem ofIsraeli identity had not been solved. He said Jews remained toopre-occupied with the borders of identity between Jew and non-Jew,and were not concerned with the nature of that identity.Jewish values in Israel embraced every aspect of daily life,unlike in the diaspora, where Jews had no responsibility for thecountry they lived in, he said.He warned that modern Hebrew, a unifying force for the Jewishpeople, would have to struggle for its future, especially inliterary circles. It faced fierce competition from the Englishlanguage.-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Israel should also maintain a presence in theJordan valley.>If so (for those of you who support it), why were so>many settlers moved into the territories?  If it is not temporary,>let's hear it.There are a number of reasons for people to move (they werenot moved, but chose to move) into disputed areas.  Note that sincethese moves were made by free willed human beings, not "settlers," Iwill address two aspects of your question, why the government wouldallow &/or encourage them to move, and second why they did move.The government had a number of reasons for encouraging peopleto move across the green line.  They included security and politics.The first reason was security.  A large Jewish presense makesit difficult for terrorists to infiltrate.  A Jewish settlements alsoact as fortresses in times of war.A second reason was political.  Creating "settlements" broughtthe arabs to the negotiation table.  Had the creation of new towns andcities gone on another several years, there would be no place left inIsrael where there was an arab majority.  There would have been noland left that could be called arab.The fact that there are a hundered thousands Jews in placechanges the face of any peace settlement, and restricts what land canbe given away.Individuals who crossed the green line had several reasons fordoing so.  They include financial, religious, and political reasons.Many of the communities created were "bedroom" communities.Suburbs.  A house 20 minutes outside of Tel Aviv cost half less if itwas on the wrong side of the green line.  People who moved therewanted a decent home at a nice price.Some of the communites created were religious.  They builttheir neighborhoods in areas where there were jews until the riots ofthe 30's and 40's.  There are communities like this in Hebron, Gaza,and all over.  There are also communities built near religious sites.The last reason people moved was to establish a politicalJewish presense outside the green line.  They built communities tocontrol important intersections, important hilltops, roads, and otherplaces.The point is, there are many reasons people moved over thegreen line, and many reasons the government wanted them to.  Whateverstatus is negotiated for disputed territories, it will not be an "allor nothing" deal.

Assuming that they are > using civilians for cover, "Assuming"? Also: come on, Brad. If we are going to get anywhere in this (or any) discussion, it doesn't help to bring up elements I never addressed, *nor commented on in any way*. I made no comment on who is "right" or who is "wrong", only that civilians ARE being used as cover and that, having been placed "in between" the Israelis and the guerillas,they *will* be injured as both parties continue their fight. [The *purpose* of an army's use of military uniforms is *to set its members apart* from the civilians so that civilians will not be thought of by the other side as"combatants". So, what do you think is the "meaning behind", the intention and the effect when an "army" purposely *does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look like civilians'? *They are judging that the benefit they will receive from this "cover" is more important that the harmthat will come to civilians.*This is a comment on the Israeli experience and is sayingthat the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civiliansin "the middle" of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apartfrom civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lowerthe risk to civilians.But if the guerillas do this aren't *they* putting themselvesat greater risk? Absolutely, they ask themselves "why set ourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made cover for us (civilians)? That makes sense from their point of view, BUT when this cover is used, the guerillas should accept some of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians.> If the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on Israel, is it not working?

I have always thought that Israel's bombingsortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane ANDineffective. BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait until attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that"taking the fight *to* the enemy" will do more to stop attacks. As I said previously, Israel spent several decades "sitting passively"on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after*the attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn't work very well.The "host" Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks from its side of the border with Israel so the number of attackswere considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact on the civilians caught in their path.  >>|> What?So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states >|> can start all over again?

This is just another "selectively applied" statement. The reason for this drawn-out impasse between Ababs/Palestinians and Israelisis that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other. By yourcriteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.That is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for the "interim" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) aredemanding conditions that essentially define "autonomy" already. They DONOT trust that Israel will "follow through" the entire process and allowPalestinians to reach full autonomy. Do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians? If you do, then why should Israel's view of Arabs/Palestinians be any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians' words?Since they don't, they are VERY reluctant to give up "tangible assets (land, control of areas) in exchange for "words". For this reason,they are also concerned about the sorts of "guarantees" they will have that the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached.>>But don't you see that the same statement can be made both ways?>If Lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word>of Israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the>Hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy.  Absolutely, so are the Arabs/Palestinians asking FIRST for theIsraelis "word" in relation to any agreement? NO, what is beingdemanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND, and one partyfinally gets HOLD of this "land", what the "other party" doesis totally irrelevent. If I NOW have possession of this land,your words have absolutely no power; whether Israel chooses tokeeps its word does NOT get the land back.>Afterall, Israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from >areas it occupied in Lebanon during SLG.>> Tim, you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have been> disarmed. Hezbollah remains the only independent militia. Hezbollah does> not attack Israel except at a few times such as when the IDF burned up> Sheikh Mosavi, his wife, and young son. While the "major armaments" (those allowing people to wage "civil wars")have been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks stillremain to some extent. Rocket attacks still continue, and "commando"raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregardfor human life (yours of that of others). Such attacks also continue.> Of course, if Israel would withdraw from Lebanon> and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't> make the Lebanese so mad as to do that.Bat guano. The situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attackswere commonplace.>Furthermore, with Hezbollah subsequently disarmed, it would not be possible.There is NO WAY these groups can be effectively "disarmed" UNLESS the stateis as authoritarian is Syria's. The only other way is for Lebanon to takeit upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel, essentiallymirroring Israel's border secirity on its side. It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL thatit is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese territory.>>|> Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain >|> control?

But, doesn't that mean that Syria has to "take over"Lebanon? I don't think Israel or Lebanon would like that.> What both "sides" need is to receive something "tangible". The Arabs/Palestinians are looking for "land" and demanding that they receive itprior to giving anything to Israel. Israel has two problems: 1) if itgives up real *land* it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategicsituation (and that change doesn't help Israel's position), and 2) WHENit gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return tocompensate for the increased risksTim

History shows that within the last 170 years, Greeks played that game twice: They used Istanbul Patriarch Grigorios in 1822 to instigate the Morea rebellion that resulted in the massacres of the Muslim people. Again, the Orthodox Patriarch Constantine V invited the Russian Czar Nicholas II to invade the Ottoman Empire 'in the name of Jesus,' and save his flock from Ottoman rule. Source: "The 'Past' in Medieval and Modern Greek Culture," in Speros         Vryonis, ed., 'Byzantina kai Metabyzantina,' Vol I (Malibu,         Calif., 1978).p. 161.In the words of Professor Skiotis, "With savage jubilance, [the Greeks]sang the words 'Let no Turk remain in the Morea, nor in the whole world.'The Greeks were determined to achieve to 'Romaiko' in the only way theyknew how: through a war of religious extermination."Let me further improve this one for you. After the Ottoman Empire lost World War I, the British landed in 1919 a 200,000 Greek army in Izmir to exterminate the people of Turkiye. Are you suffering from a severe case of amnesia? The tired and defeated Turks rose up, formed a National Force under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal, and on August 30, 1922 they annihilated the bulk of the Greek Army.Now wait, there is more.  <<The Greek War of Independence brought disaster to the Jewish communities  in the Peloponnesos, where the revolution erupted in 1821. The Jews,  because of their close association with the Ottoman administration,  were massacred along with the Turks. The Jewish communities of Mistras,  Tripolis, and Kalamata were decimated; the few survivors moved north to  settle in Chalkis and Volos, still under Ottoman rule. Patras lost its  ancient Jewish community, which was refounded only in 1905.>>                                         Nikos Stavroulakis                                      'Athens-Auschwitz', page ix.

Shaw, 'The Jews of the Ottoman Empire and           the Turkish Republic,' New York University Press, New York (1991).  page 187:  <<...the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire which had been going on  for a century was disastrous for Ottoman Jewry. This was the age of  nationalism among the Christian subjects of the Sultan, starting with  the Greek Revolution early in the nineteenth century, which, based on  the Megali Idea, or Great Idea, sought to add to Greek kingdom Istanbul  and large portions of Anatolia, union of which with Greece was felt to be  the 'dream and hope of all'. The success of the Greek national movement,  provided more in fact by the intervention of the Great Powers than by the  efforts of the Greeks themselves, stimulated similar uprisings among the  other subjects in Southeastern Europe who had long been oppressed, not so  much by the Ottomans but, rather, by the Greek religious hierarchy which  dominated the Orthodox millet, leading first to pressure for religious  independence, granted to the Bulgarian Orthodox Exarchate in 1870, to the  Serbian Church in 1879, and to the Rumanian Church in 1885, with subsequent  aspirations for, and achievement of, political independence following...>>  page 188:  <<...They [new nationalist leaders] were greatly assisted in their   campaigns against the Ottomans both by the diplomatic and consular   representatives of the major Powers of Europe and also by Christian   missionaries, who emphasized feelings of Christian superiority and   hatred for Muslims and Jews which fortified the religious as well as   ethnic bases of their pursuit of independence.   Christian nationalism, based as much on religious as on ethnic identity,   soon resurrected the medieval bigotries which had devastated both Jews   and Muslims and consequently had driven them together in the past.   Vicious anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic movements developed, involving   large-scale persecutions and massacres carried out by invading armies,   by the independent states that resulted, also by Christian subjects   who remained within the Empire, particularly because of Jewish and Muslim   support for Ottoman integrity in fear of their fate in the emergent   nationalist states of Southeastern Europe. The results were explosive   and damaging.   The invading armies of Russia and Austria as well as the revolting   nationalists and, later, successfully established independent Christian   states, committed systematic genocide against Jews and Muslims throughout   the nineteenth century, despite Great Power admonitions to the contrary   in the treaties of Paris (1858) and Berlin (1878),...>>  page 188:  <<...As the peoples of Southeastern Europe achieved their independence,   their Muslim and Jewish minorities were systematically persecuted and   massacred, and those who survived were driven beyond the ever-shrinking   boundaries of the retreating Ottoman Empire in a kind of slaughter which   had not been seen since the dispersal of the Jews from Palestine centuries   earlier.   This sort of genocide had begun as long before as the late sixteenth   century, with the Rumanian Principalities taking the lead, as united   Rumania did subsequently during the later years of the nineteenth   century. In 1579 the ruler of Moldavia, Peter the Lame, banished its   Jews because of their competition with its Christian merchants. When   Prince Micheal the Brave revolted against the Ottomans in the Rumanian   principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia in 1593, he ordered the massacre   of all the Jews as well as Turks in Bucharest.>>  page 189:  <<The slaughter continued well into the nineteenth century. When the  Greeks revolted against Ottoman rule many Greek volunteers coming from  Russia and the Principalities to join in the effort slaughtered and  plundered the Jewish communities along their paths as they went through  Moldavia and Wallachia toward Greece.>>  page 190 (second paragraph):  <<When Venice occupied the island of Chios in 1694, its Jewish population   was either massacred or deported and all Jewish communal and personal   property was stolen by the native Greek population, leaving those Jews   who returned in utter poverty and reduced to begging, no longer able to   compete with the Greeks in trade or commerce.>>  page 190 (third paragraph):  <<Jews living in Greece and the Rumanian principalities suffered terribly   because of their support for Ottoman rule. When the Greek nationalist   movement Philike Etairia started its uprising in Wallachia and Moldavia   during the spring of 1821, hundreds of Jews and Muslims were killed by   the Greeks who lived there as well as by native Wallachs [14]. During   the height of the Greek revolution, five thousand Jews were massacred   in Morea along with most of the Muslim population, numbering about   twenty thousand in all [15]. In Tripolizza alone 1,200 Jews were   massacred along with uncounted Turks [16].  Reverend John Hartley,   after describing the carnage, concluded 'Thus did Jewish blood, mingled   with Turkish, flow down the streets of captured city. The sons of Isaac   and the sons of Ishmael, on this as well as on every occasion during the   Greek Revolution, met with common fate. Their corpses were cast out of the   city, and, like the ancient sovereign of Judah, they received no burial   superior to that of an ass.' [17] Jewish communities on the islands of   Sparta, Patras, Corinthos, Mistra, and Argos were wiped out by bands of   Greek rebels along with those of Thebes, Vrachori, Attica and Epirus [18].   The surviving Jews fled to the island of Corfu, where Jews who had fled   from Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula had lived in peace and prosperity   under the Venetian rule since the twelfth century, though divided into   rival Greek and Italian communities. It was not long, however, before   it too fell victim to the Greek Revolution, leading to savage repression   and massacres of Jews, forcing the surviving members of the two communities   to come together for self-defense for the first time. Throughout the years   of Greek revolution, Greek nationalists went from town to town on the   mainland and from island to island in the Agean, exterminating all the   Jews and Muslims they could find, many along the roads as they desperately   fled to safety in what was left of the Ottoman Empire. Contemporary   accounts relate that the Greeks left the murdered Jews and Muslims lying   exposed so their bodies could be torn apart by the buzzards [19]. Most of   the Jews who survived these massacres fled across the Agean in small boats   to Izmir, thus starting its rise as one of the leading centers of Ottoman   Jewish life during the nineteenth century. Only in Northern Greece,   particularly in the areas of Janina and Salonica, were the Jews and the   Turks able to successfully resist the Greek assaults, thus saving their   populations from massacre as well [20]. During the remainder of the 19th   century, particularly during the Greek-Turkish war in 1897, those Jews   who remained in Greece in the areas of Athens, Chalkis, Larissa, Corfu   and Crete suffered severe persecution and massacre, forcing thousands   more to emigrate into Ottoman territory, particularly to Salonica and   Izmir [21].>>   page 193 (last paragraph):   <<The inclusion in the Treaty of Berlin of stipulations providing   protection for the Jewish and Muslim minorities in Southeastern Europe   stimulated more popular anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim hysteria in all   the countries involved, with blood-libel accusations once again being   used as pretexts for attacking and ravaging Jewish quarters as well as   for new tactics for boycotting Jewish shopkeepers, merchants and   professionals, a movement which was quickly adapted by the Christian   millets in the major cities of the Ottoman Empire. Because the Bulgarians,   Rumanians and Greeks correctly regarded the Jews as supporters of the   Turks, both Jews and Turks were expelled from these countries in equally   atrocious and brutal manners. Their property was plundered and their   homes and shops taken over without compensation, while the survivors   fled in desperation to Edirne and Istanbul. While official statements   subsequently were issued granting equal rights to Jews, little was done   in fact and they continued to be persecuted regularly well into the   twentieth century.>>  page 194 (last paragraph):  <<Things were not much better elsewhere in Southeastern Europe or the   Greek islands of the Agean and the eastern Mediterranean. In 1891 the   Jews on Corfu were subjected to severe persecution by local Greeks due   to the revival of the old ritual murder accusations [26]. Many of   those who survived found refuge in Ottoman territory with the help of a   popular subscription drive carried out in Istanbul under leadership of   the Banque Camondo. In 1881 and 1884, and again in 1892 and 1903,   thousands of Jews came to Ottoman territory as a result of pogroms   in Russia which went on between 1881 and 1921 with only slight periods   of respite. In 1899 Jewish families arrived in Istanbul in flight from   persecution in Vidin, in independent Bulgaria.   The conquest of Ottoman Thrace and Macedonia by Greek and Bulgarian   forces during the Balkan Wars (1912-13), including Salonica, Corlu,   and Edirne, was followed by general attacks on Jews, their synagogues,   homes and shops, in both countries [27], resulting in a renewed exodus   toward Istanbul and beyond. Two reports from Salonica graphically   described the situation caused by the invading armies:      'All the self-interested justifications of the newspapers of Europe,      all the lies which they have used to cover up the truth, can never      destroy the impression of the terrible anguish which has marked the      entry of the Greeks in Salonica. A week of terror and horror one can      never easily forget. The Hellenes now cruelly feel today all the      damage that the explosion of hatred by the (Greek) population has done      to their cause. The mob has shown itself odious and the government      weak...The incompetence of the Greek administration and the horrors      inflicted by the soldiers has put them in a terrible situation. The      consuls guaranteed the absolute safety of the Muslims, but sixty of      them were massacred in a single night....'[28]     'It wasn't only irregulars (Comitacis) who massacred, pillaged and      burned. The soldiers of the Army, the Chief of Police, and the high      civil officials took an active part in the events at Serres. Out of      6,000 houses, 4,000 were burned. Almost 1,200 shops were consumed by      flames and destructive bombs. The (Jewish) population lost all, and      without even anything to wear is in despair.

Born 1959   Teacher   Sumgait Secondary School No. 10   Secretary of the Komsomol Organization at School No. 10   Member of the Sumgait City Komsomol Committee Office   Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15   Microdistrict No. 3   Sumgait [Azerbaijan][Note: The events in Kafan, used as a pretext to attack Armenians in  Azerbaijan are false, as verified by independent International Human Rights organizations - DD]I'm thinking about the price the Sumgait Armenians paid to be living inArmenia now. We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates--theprice was too great! Now, after the Sumgait tragedy, we, the victims, divideour lives into "before" and ''after." We talk like that: that was before thewar. Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a wholeepoch, a fate. No matter how many years go by, no matter how long we live,it will never be forgotten. On the contrary, some of the moments become even sharper: in our rage, in our sorrow, we saw everything differently, but now. . . They say that you can see more with distance, and we can see thoseinhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive ourlosses and everything that happened.Nineteen eighty-eight was a leap year. Everyone fears a leap year and wants itto pass as quickly as possible. Yet we never thought that that leap year wouldbe such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian: those who lost someone and those who didn't.That second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family, although you could already smell danger in the air. But we didn't think that the danger wasnear and possible, so we didn't take any steps to save ourselves. At least, asmy parents say, at least we should have done something to save the children. My parents themselves are not that old, 52 and 53 years. But then they thoughtthat they had already lived enough, and did everything they could to save us.In our apartment the tragedy started on February 28, around five in theafternoon. I call it a tragedy, and I repeat: it was a tragedy even though allour family survived. When I recall how they broke down our door my skincrawls; even now, among Armenians, among people who wish me only well, I feellike it's all starting over again. I remember how that mob broke into our apartment . . . My parents were standing in the hall. My father had an axe in his hands and had immediately locked both of the doors. Our door was rarely locked since friends and neighbors often dropped by. We're known as a hospitable family, and we just never really thought about whether the people who were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis, Jews, or Russians. We had friendsof many nationalities, even a Turkmen woman.My parents were in the hall, my father with an axe. I remember him telling my mother, "Run to the kitchen for a knife." But Mother was detached, pale, as though she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. To be honest I never expected it of her, she's afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark. A girlfriend was at the house that day, a Russian girl, Lyuda, and Mamma said, "No matter what happens, no matter what they do to us, you're not to come out of the bedroom. We're going to tell them that we're alone in the apartment."We went into the bedroom. There were four of us. Marina and the Russian girl crawled under the bed, and we covered them up with a rug, boxes of dishes, andKarina and I are standing there and looking at one another. The idea that perhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside me. I'm an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately. I wanted toembrace her and kiss her, as though it were the last second. And maybe Karina was thinking the same thing, but she's quite reserved. We didn't have time to say anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout. There was so much noise from the tramping of feet, from the shouting, and fromexcited voices. I couldn't figure what was going on out there because the doorto the bedroom was only open a crack. But when Mamma shouted the second timeKarina ran out of the bedroom. I ran after her, I had wanted to hold her back,but when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us immediately. The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me, at least so as to save Marina and her friend. The mob was shouting, all of their eyes were shining, all red, like from insomnia. At first about 40 people burstin, but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldn't see. They came into the hall, into the kitchen, and dragged my father into the other room. He didn't utter a word, he just raised the axe to hit them, but Mamma snatched the axe from behind and said, "Tell them not to touch the children. Tell them they can do as they want with us, but not to harm the children." Shesaid this to Father in Armenian.There were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in. They understood Armenian perfectly. The local Azerbaijanis don't know Armenian, they don't need to speak it. And one of them responded in Armenian: "You and your children both . . . we're going to do the same thing to you and your children that you Armenians did in Kafan. They killed our women, our girls, our mothers, they cut their breasts off, and burned our houses . . . ," and so on and so forth, "and we came to do the same thing to you." This whole timesome of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us. They were mostly young people, under 30. At first there weren't any older people among them. And all of their faces were unfamiliar. Sumgait is a small town, all the same, and we know a lot of people by their faces, especially me, I'm a teacher.So they dragged my father into the other room. They twisted his arms and took him in there, no they didn't take him in there, they dragged him in there,because he was already unable to walk. They closed the door to that room all but a crack. We couldn't see what was happening to Father, what they were doing to him. Then a young man, about 26 years old, started to tear off Mamma's sarafan, and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani: "I'm old enough to be your mother! What are you doing?!" He struck her. Now he's being held, Mamma identified him. I hope he's convicted. Then they went after Karina, who's been talking to them like a Komsomol leader, as though she were trying to lead them down a different path, as they say, to influence their consciousness. She told them that what they were doing was wrong, that they mustn't do it. She said, "Come on, let's straighten this out, without emotions. What do you want? Who are you? Why did you come here? What did we ever do to you?" Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come into our home, but then the ones in the back--more of them kept coming and coming--said, "What are you talking to, them for. You should kill them. We came here to kill them."They pushed Karina, struck her, and she fell down. They beat her, but she didn't cry out. Even when they tore her clothes off, she kept repeating, "Whatdid we do to you? What did we do to you?" And even later, when she came to, she said, "Mamma, what did we do to them? Why did they do that to us?"That group was prepared, I know this because I noticed that some of them only broke up furniture, and others only dealt with us. I remember that when they were beating me, when they were tearing my clothes off, I felt neither pain nor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina. All I could do was watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her, and what theydid to her. That's why I felt no pain. Later, when they carried Karina off, they beat her savagely . . . It's really amazing that she not only lived, but didn't lose her mind . She is very beautiful and they did everything they could to destroy her beauty. Mostly they beat her face, with their fists, kicking her, using anything they could find.Mamma, Karina, and I were all in one room. And again I didn't feel any pain, just didn't feel any, no matter how much they beat me, no matter what they did. Then one of those creeps said that there wasn't enough room in theapartment. They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the corners so there would be more room. Then someone suggested, "Let's take her outside."Those beasts were in Heaven. They did what they would do every day if they weren't afraid of the authorities. Those were their true colors. At the time I thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren't afraid of what would happen to them.When they carried Karina out and beat Mamma-her face was completely covered with blood--that's when I started to feel the pain. I blacked out several times from the pain, but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though I were recording it all on film. I think I'm a kind person by nature, but I'm vengeful, especially if someone is mean to me, and I don't deserve it. I hold a grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain. And every time I would come to and see one of those animals on top of me, I'd remember them, and I'll remember them for the rest of my life, even though people tell me "forget," you have to forget, you have to go on living.At some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something, and despite the fact that I hurt all over--I had been beaten terribly--I foundthe strength in myself to interfere with their tortures. I realized that I hadto do something: resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering to an end. I pushed one of them away, he was a real horse. I remember now thathe's being held, too. As though they were all waiting for it, they seized meand took me out onto the balcony. I had long hair, and it was stuck all overme. One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open, and I realized thatthey planned to throw me out the window, because they had already picked me upwith their hands, I was up in the air. As though for the last time I took a really deep breath and closed my eyes, and somehow braced myself inside, I suddenly became cold, as though my heart had sunk into my feet. And suddenly I felt myself flying. I couldn't figure out if I was really flying or if I just imagined it. When I came to I thought now I'm going to smash on the ground. And when it didn't happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was still lying on the floor. And since I didn't scream, didn't beg them at all,they became all the more wild, like wolves. They started to trample me withtheir feet. Shoes with heels on them, and iron horseshoes, like they had spe-cially put them on. Then I lost consciousness.I came to a couple of times and waited for death, summoned it, beseeched it. Some people ask for good health, life, happiness, but at that moment I didn't need any of those things. I was sure that none of us would survive, and I had even forgotten about Marina; and if none of us was alive, it wasn't worth living.There was a moment when the pain was especially great. I withstood inhuman pain, and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come because I had showed myself to be so tenacious. I started to strangle myself, and when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going toput an end to their pleasures, and they pulled my hands from my throat. The person who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well, because he was the oldest in the group. He looked around 48. I know that he has four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person, one who would never do such a thing. Something came over him then, you see, even during the investigation he almost called me "daughter," he apologized, although, of course, he knew that I'd never forgive him. Something like that I can never forgive. I have never injured anyone with my behavior, with my words, or with my deeds, I have always put myself in the other person's shoes,but then, in a matter of hours, they trampled me entirely. I shall never forget it.I wanted to do myself in then, because I had nothing to lose, because no one could protect me. My father, who tried to do something against that hoard of beasts by himself, could do nothing and wouldn't be able to do anything.I knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive.And Ira Melkumian, my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family acouple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn't, so he tried to kill her, his very own sister. He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an end to her suffering. When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into the other room, her brother knew what awaited her. I don't know which one it was, Edik or Igor. Both of them were in the room from which the axe was thrown. But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her and made her death even more excruciating, maybe the most excruciating of all the deaths of those days in Sumgait. I heard about it all from the neighbor from the Melkumians' landing. His name is Makhaddin, he knows my family a little. He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku,how we were feeling, and if we needed anything. He's a good person. He said, "You should praise God that you all survived. But what I saw with my own eyes,I, a man, who has seen so many people die, who has lived a whole life, I," hesays, "nearly lost my mind that day. I had never seen the likes of it and think I never shall again." The door to his apartment was open and he saw everything. One of the brothers threw the axe, because they had already taken the father and mother out of the apartment. Igor, Edik, and Ira remained. He saw Ira, naked, being carried into the other room in the hands of six or sevenpeople. He told us about it and said he would never forget it. He heard the brothers shouting something, inarticulate from pain, rage, and the fact that they were powerless to do anything. But all the same they tried to do something. The guy who got hit with the axe lived.                                                                           I     IAfter I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom. I was in such a state that I couldn't even remember my sister's name. I wanted to cry "Marina!" out to her, but couldnot. I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar, dear face, but couldn'tfor the life of me remember what her name was and who she was. And thusI saved her, because when they were taking her out, she, as it turns out, hadtold them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were boththere by chance, that they weren't Armenians. Lyuda's a Russian, you can tell right away, and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them thatshe was an Azerbaijani. And I almost gave her away and doomed her. I'm glad that at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health . . . although her spirit was murdered . . .At some point I came to and saw Igor, Igor Agayev, my acquaintance, in that mob. He lives in the neighboring building. For some reason I remembered his name, maybe I sensed my defense in him. I called out to him in Russian, "Igor,help!" But he turned away and went into the bedroom. Just then they were taking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom. Igor said he knew Marina and Lyuda, that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani, and he took both of them to the neighbors.And the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment, something like that, but if he was my friend, he was supposed to save me. Then they were striking me very hard--we have an Indian vase, a metal one, they were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked out--they took me out onto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window. They were already sure that I was dead because I didn't react at all to the new blows. Someone said, "She's already dead, let's throw her out." When they carried me out ontothe balcony for the second time, when I was about to die the second time, I heard someone say in Azerbaijani: "Don't kill her, I know her, she's a teacher." I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears, but I can't rememberwhose voice it was. It wasn't Igor, because he speaks Azerbaijani with an accent: his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at home. He speaksAzerbaijani worse than our Marina does. I remember when they carried me in andthrew me on the bed he came up to me, that person, and I having opened my eyes, saw and recognized that person, but immediately passed out cold. I had been beaten so much that I didn't have the strength to remember him. I only remember that this person was older and he had a high position. Unfortunately I can't remember anything more.What should I say about Igor? He didn't treat me badly. I had heard a lot about him, that he wasn't that good a person, that he sometimes drank toomuch. Once he boasted to me that he had served in Afghanistan. He knew that women usually like bravery in a man. Especially if a man was in Afghanistan,if he was wounded, then it's about eighty percent sure that he will be treatedvery sympathetically, with respect. Later I found out that he had served in Ufa, and was injured, but that's not in Afghanistan, of course. I found that all out later.Among the people who were in our apartment, my Karina also saw the Secretary of the Party organization. I don't know his last name, his first name is Najaf, he is an Armenian-born Azerbaijani. But later Karina wasn't so sure,she was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw, and she didn't want to endanger him. She said, "He was there," and a little while later, "Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone else. No, it seems like it was he." I am sure it was he because when he came to see us the first time he said one thing, and the next time he said something entirely different. The investigators haven't summoned him yet. He came to seeus in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the time. He brought groceries and flowers, this was right before March 8th; he almost started crying, he was so upset to see our condition. I don't know if he was putting us on or not, but later, after we had told the investigator and they summoned him to the Procuracy, he said that he had been in Baku, he wasn't in Sumgait. The fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is right, that in fact it was he who was in our apartment. I don't know how the investigators are now treating him. At one point I wondered and asked, and wastold that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment. Couldn't he have gone to Baku and arranged an alibi? I'm not ruling out that possibility.Ill now return to our apartment. Mamma had come to. You could say that she bought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married: her wedding band and her watch were gold. She bought her own and her husband's lives with them. She gave the gold to a 14-year old boy. Vadim Vorobyev. A Russian boy, he speaks Azerbaijani perfectly. He's an orphan who was raised byhis grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami Street. He goes to a special school, one for mentally handicapped children. But I'll say this--I'm a teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinion--thatboy is not at all mentally handicapped. He's healthy, he can think just fine, and analyze, too . . . policemen should be so lucky. And he's cunning, too. After that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album.He beat Mamma and demanded gold, saying, "Lady, if you give us all the gold and money in your apartment we'll let you live." And Mamma told them where the gold was. He brought in the bag and opened it, shook out the contents, and everyone who was in the apartment jumped on it, started knocking each other over and taking the gold from one another. I'm surprised they didn't kill one another right then.Mamma was still in control of herself. She had been beaten up, her face wasblack and blue from the blows, and her eyes were filled with blood, and she ran into the other room. Father was lying there, tied up, with a gag in hismouth and a pillow over his face. There was a broken table on top of the pil-low. Mamma grabbed Father and he couldn't walk; like me, he was half dead, halfway into the other world. He couldn't comprehend anything, couldn't see, and was covered with black and blue. Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth, it was some sort of cloth, I think it was a slipcover from an armchair.The bandits were still in our apartment, even in the room Mamma pulled Father out of, led him out of, carried him out of. We had two armchairs in that room,a small magazine table, a couch, a television, and a screen. Three people were standing next to that screen, and into their shirts, their pants, everywhere imaginable, they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffeeservice--Mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye. She said, "I was afraid to turn around, I just seized Father and started pulling him, but at the threshold I couldn't hold him up, he fell down, and I picked him up again and dragged him down the stairs to the neighbors'." Mamma remembered one of the criminals, the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her, out of one eye. She says, "I realized that my death would come from that person. I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing."Later they caught that scoundrel. Meanwhile, Mamma grabbed Father and left.I was alone. Igor had taken Marina away, Mamma and Father were gone, Karina was already outside, I didn't know what they were doing to her. I was left allalone, and at that moment . . . I became someone else, do you understand? Eventhough I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room, nor Marina andLyuda under the bed could save me, all the same I somehow managed to hold out.I went on fighting them, I bit someone, I remember, and I scratched another. But when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were, the ones I had observed, the ones who beat Karina, what kind of people they were, the ones who beat me, that it was all unnecessary, that I was about to die and that all of that would die with me.At some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next building. I didn't know his name, but we would greet one another when we met, we knew thatwe were from the same microdistrict. When I saw him I said, "Neighbor, is thatyou?" In so doing I placed myself in great danger. He realized that if I livedI would remember him. That's when he grabbed the axe. The axe that had been taken from my father. I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to take the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if hehad struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. When he started getting ready to wind back for the blow, someone came into the room. The newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor's axe froze in the air. Everyone stood at attention for this guy, like soldiers in the presence of a general. Everyone waited for his word: continue the atrocities or not. He said, "Enough, let's go to the third entryway." In the third entryway they killed Uncle Shurik, Aleksandr Gambarian. This confirms once again that they had prepared in advance. Almost all of them left with him, as they went picking up pillows, blankets, whatever they needed, whatever they found, all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot, someone else had already taken the other.Four people remained in the room, soldiers who didn't obey their general. Theyhad to have come recently, because other faces had flashed in front of me overthose 2 to 3 hours, but I had never seen those three. One of them, Kuliyev (I identified him later), a native of the Sisian District of Armenia, an Azerbaijani, had moved to Azerbaijan a year before. He told me in Armenian:"Sister, don't be afraid, I'll drive those three Azerbaijanis out of here."That's just what he said, "those Azerbaijanis," as though he himself were not Azerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, "I'll drivethem out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nailsand nail the door shut, because they'll be coming back from Apartment 41." That's when I found out that they had gone to Apartment 41. Before that, the person in the Eskimo dogskin coat, the one who came in and whom they listened to, the "general," said that they were going to the third entryway.Kuliyev helped me get some clothes on, because l couldn't do it by myself. Marina's old fur coat was lying on the floor. He threw it over my shoulders, Iwas racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer. He wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut. But the door was lying on the floor in the hall.I went out onto the balcony. There were broken windows, and flowers and dirt from flowerpots were scattered on the floor. It was impossible to find anything. He told me, "Well, fine, I won't leave you here. Would any of the neighbors let you in? They'll be back, they won't calm down, they know you're alive." He told me all this in Armenian.Then he returned to the others and said, "What are you waiting for? Leave!" They said, "Ah, you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her yourself. No, we want to do it to." He urged them on, but gently, not coarsely, because he was alone against them, although they were still justboys, not old enough to be drafted. He led them out of the room, and wentdown to the third floor with them himself, and said, "Leave. What's the mat-ter, aren't you men? Go fight with the men. What do you want of her?" Andhe came back upstairs. They wanted to come up after him and he realized that he couldn't hold them off forever. Then he asked me where he could hide me. I told him at the neighbors' on the fourth floor, Apartment 10, we were on reallygood terms with them.We knocked on the door, and he explained in Azerbaijani. The neighbor woman opened the door and immediately said, "I'm an Azerbaijani." He said, "I know. Let her sit at your place a while. Don't open the door to anyone, no one knowsabout this, I won't tell anyone. Let her stay at your place." She says, "Fine,have her come in." I went in. She cried a bit and gave me some stockings, I had gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders. I burst into tears. Even though I was wearing Marina's old fur coat, it's a short one, a half-length, I was cold all the same. I asked, "Do you know where my family is, what happened to them?" She says, "No, I don't know anything. I'm afraid to go out of the apartment, now they're so wild that they don't look to see who's Azerbaijani and who's Armenian." Kuliyev left. Ten minutes later my neighbor says, "You know, Lyuda, I don't want to lose my life because of you, or my son and his wife. Go stay with someone else." During the butchery in ourapartment one of the scum, a sadist, took my earring in his mouth--I had pearlearrings on--and ripped it out, tearing the earlobe. The other earring was still there. When I'm nervous I fix my hair constantly, and then, when I touched my ear, I noticed that I had one earring on. I took it out and gave itto her. She took the earring, but she led me out of the apartment.I went out and didn't know where to go. I heard someone going upstairs. I don't know who it was but assumed it was them. With tremendous difficulty I end up to our apartment, I wanted to die in my own home. I go into the apartment and hear that they are coming up to our place, to the fifth floor. I had to do something. I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had hidden and saw that the bed was overturned. Instead of hiding I squatted near some broken Christmas ornaments, found an unbroken one, and started sobbing. Then they came in. Someone said that there were still some things to take. I think that someone pushed me under the bed. I lay on the floor, and there werebroken ornaments on it, under my head and legs. I got all cut up, but I lay there without moving. My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town could hear it. There were no lights on. Maybe that's what saved me. They were burning matches, and toward the end they brought in a candle. They startedpicking out the clothes that could still be worn. They took Father's sport jacket and a bedspread, the end of which was under my head. They pulled on theone end, and it felt like they were pulling my hair out. I almost cried out. And again I realized I wasn't getting out of there alive, and I started to strangle myself again. I took my throat in one hand, and pressed the other on my mouth, so as not to wheeze, so that I would die and they would only find meafterward. They were throwing the burned matches under the bed, and I got burned, but I withstood it. Something inside of me held on, someone's hand wasprotecting me to the end. I knew that I was going to die, but I didn't know how. I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment, but if I found out that one of my family had died, I would die for sure, because I had never been so close to death and couldn't imagine how you could go on living without your mother or father, or without your sister. Marina, I thought, was still alive: she went to Lyuda's place or someone is hiding her. I tried to think that Igor wouldn't let them be killed. He served in Afghanistan, he should protect her.While I was strangling myself I said my good-byes to everyone. And then Ithought, how could Marina survive alone. If they killed all of us, how would she live all by herself? There were six people in the room. They talked among themselves and smoked. One talked about his daughter, saying that there was nochildren's footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter. Another said that he liked the apartment--recently we had done a really good job fixing everything up--and that he would live there after everything was all over. They started to argue. A third one says, "How come you get it? I have four children, and there are three rooms here, that's just what I need. All these years I've been living in God-awful places." Another one says, "Neither of you gets it. We'll set fire to it and leave." Then someone said that Azerbaijanis live right next door, the fire could move over to theirplace. And they, to my good fortune, didn't set fire to the apartment, andleft.Oh, yes, I just remembered. While they were raping me they repeated quite frequently, "Let the Armenian women have babies for us, Muslim babies, let them bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Armenians." Then they said, "Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause. Heroes!" They repeated it very often.     - - - reference for #008 - - -[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

Page A11.FIGURE IN ADL SPY CASE ARRESTED AT S.F. AIRPORT    ESPIONAGE: Former police officer is taken into custody upon    arriving from Philippines, where he had fled after FBI    interrogation.By Jenifer Warren, Times staff writerSan Francisco -- A former San Francisco police officer who fled to thePhilippines amid accusations that he funneled confidential lawenforcement information to an investigator for the Anti-DefamationLeague was arrested at the airport here on 11 felony charges, policesaid Friday.Thomas J. Gerard who abruptly left the United States in October afterthe FBI questioned him about his activities, was apprehended Thursdaynight after a source in the Philippines told investigators that Gerardwas returning home.Gerard, 50, was booked into San Francisco County Jail early Fridaymorning on eight counts of theft of government documents and one counteach of computer theft, burglary and conspiracy.If convicted on all charges, Gerard could face 16 years in prison and$40,000 in fines.  Bail was initially set at $250,000 after policeargued that he was a flight risk, but it was later reduced to $20,000. A friend of Gerard was trying to post bail late Friday afternoon, asheriff's spokeswoman said.Gerard returned to the United because he missed his wife and child,with whom he lived on a houseboat in Sausalito, and "wanted to havehis day in court," said Police Capt. John Willett, his former boss andone of two arresting officers.Gerard, an undercover agent for the Central Intelligence Agency from1982 to 1985, also feared that the CIA was out to kill him, Willettsaid.  In an interview with The Times last month, Gerard threatened todisclose illegal CIA support of death squads in Central America if hewas indicted and tried on the San Francisco spying charges.Gerard is a central figure in a scandal over an intelligence networkoperated by the Anti-Defamation League, a prominent Jewish civilrights organization.  Investigators allege that Gerard illegally gavecriminal histories to Roy Bullock, a San Francisco art dealer who saidhe has been an undercover ADL intelligence operative for 40 years.Investigators said they found confidential police files in Bullock'shome computer -- which contained entries on 10,000 people and 950groups -- and in boxes in his apartment.  Files have also been seizedunder search warrants from ADL offices in San Francisco and LosAngeles but authorities have not disclosed their contents.Gerard could not be reached for comment Friday, and his attorney,James Lassart, did not return telephone calls seeking comment.  In theinterview with The Times last month, however, Gerard acknowledgedsnooping and sharing some information with Bullock, but denied anycriminal wrongdoing.Bullock and Gerard also are under investigation for sellingintelligence to South Africa.ADL officials have described Bullock as a $550-a-week independentcontractor and have vigorously denied knowledge of any illegalactivity.  On Friday, ADL lawyer Jerrold Ladar said Gerard's arrest"has nothing to do with ADL.  Other than that, we have no comment onthe case."Arab-American groups -- which were a main target of the spying,according to police -- applauded the arrest and pressed authorities topursue the investigation."We urge investigators to carry this case forward and to publiclydisclose the full extent of ADL and law enforcement involvement," saidJames Zogby, head of the Arab American Institute in Washington.Police, meanwhile, characterized Gerard's arrest -- the first in theinquiry into the spying scandal -- as an unexpected breakthrough.  Aformer police colleague of Gerard, Inspector Fred Mollat, visitedGerard several weeks ago and urged him to return home."I knew he wouldn't want to live on an island on the lam forever, butwe didn't think it would happen this quickly," Capt. Willett said. "This development really speeds up our timetable on the case."During his 25-year career on the police force, Gerard was a highlyregarded officer known for his work in the department's intelligencedivision.  His last assignment was on the gang task force.After FBI agents questioned Gerard last fall, he took early retirementand fled to the remote jungle island of Palawan, 300 miles south ofManila.Gerard was arrested at 8:40 p.m. as he stepped from his PhilippinesAirlines flight. He was traveling alone and looked tanned but haggardafter his six-month hiatus, police said."He was surprised when he saw us standing there, and got a shockedlook on his face," Willett said.  "Then he said, 'Hello, I'm back.'" --Yigal ArensUSC/ISI                                                TV made me do it!arens@isi.edu

In any case, past actions do notAnd the best evidence you can find is second hand hearsay froman unnamed source? You may indeed be confusing *some* Muslims with Nazi Armenians. Altogether 30,000 Nazi Armenians served in various units in the German Wehrmacht, according to Ara J. Berkian. 14,000 in predominantly Armenian army units, 6,000 in German army units, 8,000 in various working units and 2,000 in the Waffen-SS.[1]A number of these Nazi Armenians were volunteers from France,Greece, Rumania and Bulgaria who had chosen to committhemselves to the German war effort. Derounian says that"Dashnag Armenians from France bore the mark 'Legion Armenienne.'"[2]That Nazi Armenians like Dro 'the Butcher' and Nezhdeh sidedwith the Germans probably had an impact on the decision ofArmenians who overwhelmingly opted for armed service.[1] Enno Meyer, A. J. Berkian, 'Zwischen Rhein und Arax, 900    Jahre Deutsch-Armenische beziehungen,' (Heinz Holzberg    Verlag-Oldenburg 1988), pp. 118/119.     [2] John Roy Carlson (Arthur Derounian), in 'The Armenian     Displaced Persons,' ibid., p. 19.In fall 1942, the Armenian infantry battalions 808 and 809 were formed,to be followed by battalions 810, 812 and 813 in spring 1943. In the second half of 1943 infantry battalions 814, 815 and 816 were created.These battalions together with other indigenous Caucasian units wereattached to the infantry division 162. Also attached to ID 162 werethe field battalions II/9, I/125 and I/198 which were formed betweenMay 1942 and May 1943. Altogether twelve Armenian battalions served theNazi army, if battalion II/73, which was not employed at any time, is to beincluded.[1] Most battalions were commanded by Nazi Armenian officers.Armenians wore German uniforms with an armband in the Dashnag colours red-blue-orange and the inscription 'Armenien.'[1] Joachim Hoffmann, 'Dies Ostlegionen 1941-1943, Turkotataren,     Kaukasier und Wolgafinned im deutschen Heer,' (Verlag Rombach    Freiburg 1976), p. 172.While having collaborated with the Nazis against Stalin during theSecond World War, Nazi Armenians changed their policy after Hitler'sdefeat. They now backed Stalin's claims on Eastern Turkish provinces,hoping that these would be annexed to Soviet Armenia and their Muslim population would be exterminated. Stalin played on Armenian nationalsentiments to enlist the support of Armenians in the USSR and Americafor his imperial ambitions.[1] Stalin's ultimatum to the Turkishgovernment led Truman to formulate his famous Doctrine.[1] Walter Kolarz, 'Religion in the Soviet Union,' (London, Macmillan &    Co Ltd; New York, St Martin's Press 1961), pp. 160-164.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

OK, I see.   Lets not even act as if there is a chance they are human.  See Serdar, when you  judge people because of their race this is called racism.  I tend to frown on  this sort of thing.  Obviously you don't.  When you label an entire race the  way you do, it is easy to stop thinking of them as human beings, and this can  make GENOCIDE possible.

This is  very cute how you inserted children in this fill in the blank accusation sheet  you fill out every day.  It really touches my heart.  Oh and thank you for  letting me know that Kurds and Armenians hate each other.  I was not aware of  this.

Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as they ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to journalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts of the hills.The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians last week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death or missing... Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there was a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer ripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We swung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.We had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round again, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a valley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung round again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired repeated blasts.Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in fact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter. I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window, its cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on "our side". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a search-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two M24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed flying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second crocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters were there to give covering fire if necessary.The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani official told us that there were now five former Soviet military helicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. "They have signed contracts to fly for us," he said. The helicopter we engaged in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian pilot, but fighting for the Armenians.We had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an heated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer white wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four corpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies on the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back towards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.Back at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the civilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were covered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor mortis. They had been shot.What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave, and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN, POLITELY DECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS, AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

That is what differenciates agnostics from atheists.As an atheist, I do not believe there is a god, nor do I believe thatthere ever was one.So, those commandments have no meaning to me. Also, there are a lotof ideas that have no meaning to me: The idea of a chosen people,the idea of a given right to the land of Israel, the idea of keepingkosher, the idea of opposing intermarriage, the idea of having a Torah that was inspired by god, etc. By being an atheist, I cannot support the idea of the Jewish Nationas defined by a religious principle or based on a religious identity.For me, religion is just another piece in what constitutes the culturalidentity of the Jewish people. I believe that as a people with a cultural identity they constitute a Nation and have the same right asany other people in the world to have their own State. The same rightas the Armenians have, as the Palestinians have, as the French have,and as anybody else have.I cannot say that by accepting a different god someone has lost all cultural identification. >>Adam>>>>Adam Shostack        adam@das.harvard.eduAAP

They left and I had an attack. I realized that the dan-ger was past, and stopped controlling myself. I relaxed for a moment and the physical pain immediately made itself felt. My heart and kidneys hurt. I had an awful kidney attack. I rolled back and forth on top of those Christmasornaments, howling and howling. I didn't know where I was or how long this went on. When we figured out the time, later it turned out that I howled and was in pain for around an hour. Then all my strength was gone and I burst intotears, I started feeling sorry for myself, and so on and so forth . . .Then someone came into the room. I think I hear someone calling my name. I want to respond and restrain myself, I think that I'm hallucinating. I am silent, and then it continues: it seems that first a man's voice is callingme, then a woman's. Later I found out that Mamma had sent our neighbor, theone whose apartment she was hiding in, Uncle Sabir Kasumov, to our place, telling him, "I know that they've killed Lyuda. Go there and at least bring her corpse to me so they don't violate her corpse." He went and returned emptyhanded, but Mamma thought he just didn't want to carry the corpse into his apartment. She sent him another time, and then sent his wife, and they were walking through the rooms looking for me, but I didn't answer their calls. There was no light, they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps.They started the pogrom in our apartment around five o'clock, and at 9:30 I went down to the Kasumovs'. I went down the stairs myself. I walked out of theapartment: how long can you wait for your own death, how long can you be cowardly, afraid? Come what will. I walked out and started knocking on the doors one after the next. No one, not on the fifth floor, not on the fourth, opened the door. On the third floor, on the landing of the stairway, Uncle Sabir's son started to shout, "Aunt Roza, don't cry, Lyuda's alive!" He knocked on his own door and out came Aunt Tanya, Igor, and after them, Mamma. Aunt Tanya, Uncle Sabir's wife, is an Urdmurt. All of us were in their apartment. I didn't see Karina, but she was in their home, too, Lyingdelirious, she had a fever. Marina was there too, and my father and mother.All of my family had gathered there.   At the door I lost consciousness. Igor and Aunt Tanya carried me into theapartment.Later I found out what they had done to our Karina. Mamma said, "Lyuda, Karina's in really serious condition, she's probably dying. If she recognizes you, don't cry, don't tell her that her face looks so awful." It was as thoughher whole face was paralyzed, you know, everything was pushed over to one side, her eye was all swollen, and everything flowed together, her lips, her cheeks . . . It was as though they had dragged her right side around the wholemicrodistrict, that's how disfigured her face was. I said, "Fine." Mamma was afraid to go into the room, because she went in and hugged Karina and started to cry. I went in. As soon as I saw her my legs gave way. I fell down near thebed, hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying. She opened the eye that was intact, looked at me, and said, "Who is it?" But I could barely talk, my whole face was so badly beaten. I didn't say, but rather muttered somethingtender, something incomprehensible, but tender, "My Karochka, my Karina, my little golden one . . . " She understood me.Then Igor brought me some water, I drank it down and moistened Karina's lips. She started to groan. She was saying something to me, but I couldn't understand it. Then I made out, "It hurts, I hurt all over." Her hair was glued down with blood. I stroked her forehead, her head, she had grit on her forehead, and on her lips . . . She was groaning again, and I don't know how to help her. She calls me over with her hand, come closer. I go to her. She'ssaying something to me, but I can't understand her. Igor brings her a pencil and paper and says, "Write it down." She shakes her head as if to say, no, I can't write. I can't understand what she's saying. She wanted to tell me something, but she couldn't. I say, "Karina, just lie there a little while,then maybe you'll feel better and you can tell me then." And then she says,"Maybe it'll be too late." And I completely . . . just broke down, I couldn'tcontrol myself.Then I moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye. I dippeda handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips. She says, "Lyuda, we're not saved yet, we have to go somewhere else. Out of this damned house. They want to kill us, I know. They'll find us here, too. We needto call Urshan." She repeated this to me for almost a whole hour, Until I understood her every word. I ask, "What's his number?" Urshan Feyruzovich, that's the head of the administration where she works. "We have to call him." But I didn't know his home number. I say, "Karina, what's his number?" She says, "I can't remember." I say, "Who knows his number? Who can I call?" She says, "I don't know anything, leave me alone."I went out of the room. Igor stayed to watch over her and sat there, he was crying, too. I say, "Mamma, Karina says that we have to call Urshan. How can we call him? Who knows his telephone number?" I tell Marina, "Think, think, who can we call to find out?" She started calling; several people didn't answer. She called a girlfriend, her girlfriend called another girlfriend and found out the number and called us back. The boss's wife answered and said he was at the dacha. My voice keeps cracking, I can't talk normally. She says, "Lyuda, don't panic, get a hold of yourself, go out to those hooligans and tell them that they just can't do that." She still didn't know what was reallygoing on. I said, "It's easy for you to say that, you don't understand what's happening. They are killing people here. I don't think there is a single Armenian left in the building, they've cut them all up. I'm even surprised that we managed to save ourselves. "She says, "Well, OK, if it's that serious . . . " And all the same she's thinking that my emotions are all churned up and that I'm fearing for my life, that in fact it's not all that bad. "OK, fine, fine," she says, "if you're afraid, OK, as soon as Urshan comes back I'll send him over."We called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly under Aunt Tanya's, on the second floor, Asya Dallakian's apartment. She wasn't home, she was staying with her daughter in Karabagh. They destroyed everything there . . . We realized that they still might come back. We kept ontrying to get through to Aunt Tanya--Urshan's wife is named Tanya too and finally we get through. She says, "Yes, he's come home, he's leaving for your place now." He came. Of course he didn't know what was happening, either, because he brought two of his daughters with him. He came over in his jeep with his two daughters, like he was going on an outing. He came and saw what shape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened. He has grown up daughters, they're almost my age.The three of us carried out Karina, tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf, andwent down to his car. He took Karina and me to the Maternity Home. . . No, first they took us to the po]ice precinct. They had stretchers ready. Assoon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and saidthat we were in serious condition and that we mustn't move, we might havefractures. From the stretcher I saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on thefirst floor, bandaged, on the concrete floor, groaning . . . This was aroundeleven o'clock at night. We had left the house somewhere around 1:30. When I saw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on: soldiers, enemies. . . everything just like a war.They carried me into some office on the stretcher. The emergency medicalpeople from Baku were there. The medical attendant there was an older Armenian. Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she's so proud she would never have told. And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle Arkady, I think, because someone said "Arkady, get an injection ready," he started to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But when he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man, in his sixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. He hugged Karina and started to cry: "What have they done to you?!" He was speaking Armenian. "Whathave they done to you?!" Karina didn't say anything. Mamma came in then, and she started to cry, too. The man tried to calm her. "I'll give you a shot." Mamma tells him, "I don't need any shot. Where is the government? Just what are they doing? Look what they've done to my children! They're killing people,and you're just sitting here!" Some teacups were standing on the table in there. "You're sitting here drinking tea! Look what they've done to my daughters! Look what they've turned them into!" They gave her something to drink, some heart medicine, I think. They gave Karina an injection and thedoctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa and Urshan, I think, even though Papa was in bad shape, helped carry Karina out. When they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. I don't know, maybe there weren't any orderlies. Then they came to me: "What's the matter with you?" Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighterin the half-length coat. I had a blanket on, too, an orange one, Aunt Tanya's.I said, "I'm fine." Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told the doctor, "You leave, let a woman examine her." A woman came, an Azerbaijani, I believe, and said, "What's wrong with you?" I was wearing my sister Lyuda's nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When she was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would be easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showedher. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge wound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the Indian vase. She said something to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be dressed with something, but that they'd do that in the hospital.They put me on a stretcher, too. They started looking for people to carry me. I raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, I don't know if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, "Lie still, you mustn't move." WhenI was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed very familiar to me. I shouted, "Stop!" One of the policemen turned and says, "What do you want?" I say, "Bring him to me, I want to look at him." They brought him over and I said, "That person was just in our apartment and he just raped me and my sister. I recognize him, note it down." They said, "Fine," but didn't write it down and led him on. I don't know where they were taking him.Then they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were sitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car up closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me, "Sister . . . " I don't remember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what theydid to us. I asked him, "Where are you from?" He said that he was from Ufa. Apparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I learned that they suffered most of all. He says, "OK, you're Armenians, they didn't get along with you, but I'm a Russian," he says, "what are they trying to kill me for?" Oh, I remembered something else. When I went out onto the balcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw two Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed against the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating himwith his own club. The way he cried "Mamma" made my skin crawl. I don't know what they did to him, if he's still alive or not. And something else. Before he attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from thethird or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but I didn't think it was Azerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or theywere throwing something they didn't need out, or someone was fighting with someone. It was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the yard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians, thatI realized that this was serious, that it was anti-Armenian.They took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too and said, "I've been beaten too, help me." But they just ignored her. My father went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault that he'd been beaten, and says, "My ribs hurt so much, those creeps have probably broken my ribs. Please look at them." The doctor says, "That's not myjob." Urshan said, "Fine, I'll take you to my place and if we need a doctor, I'll find you one. I'll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them to his apartment.Marina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the doctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I wasn't surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but I was verysurprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken theHippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that. By happy--or unhappy--coincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina. And she,having examined Karina, said, "No problem, you got off pretty good. Not like they did in Kafan, when you Armenians were killing and raping our women."Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn't say anything--shewould certainly have had something to say! Then they examined me. The same story. They put us in a separate ward. No shots, no medicinal powders, no drugs. Absolutely none! They didn't even give us tea. All the women there soonfound out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped. Andthey started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at zoo animals. Karina didn't see this, she was lying there, and I kept her from seeing it.They put Ira B. in our ward. She had also been raped. True, she didn't have any serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their place, I felt worse for them than I did for us. Because when they raped Ira her daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. AndIra was holding her daughter's hand, the one who was hiding under the bed.When they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she involuntarily let go of her daughter's hand, her daughter took her hand again.Her daughter is in the fourth grade, she's 11 years old. I felt really awful when I heard that. Ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, "Do whatyou want with me, just leave my daughter alone." Well, they did what they wanted. They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. Now I would be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. It was simply Bartholomew's Night, I say, they did what they would love to do every day: steal, kill, rape . . .Many are surprised that those animals didn't harm the children. The beasts explained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those children would be grown, and then, as they put it, "we'll come take the pleasure out of their lives, those children." This was about the girls thatwould be young women in 15 years. They were thinking about their tomorrow because they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, justas there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be of some use in 15 years. This I heard from the investigators; one of the victims testified to it. That's how they described their own natures, thatthey would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--theythemselves said that.And this, too. Everyone is surprised that they didn't harm our Marina. Many people say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. I don't know why their eyes were red. Maybe because they hadn't slept the night before, maybe for some other reason, I don't know. But they hadn't been smoking and they weren't drunk, I'm positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at nothing he has the urge to do. And they spoke in a cultured fashion with Marina: "Little sister, don't be afraid, we won't harm you, don't look over there [where I was], you might be frightened. You're a Muslim, a Muslim woman shouldn't see such things." So they were really quite sober . . .So we came out of that story alive. Each every day we have lived since it all happened bears the mark of that day. It wasn't even a day, of those several hours. Father still can't look us in the eyes. He still feels guilty for whathappened to Karina, Mother, and me. Because of his nerves he's started talk-ing to himself, I've heard him argue with himself several times when hethought no one is listening: "Listen," he'll say, "what could I do? What couldI do alone, how could I protect them?" I don't know where to find the words,it's not that I'm happy, but I am glad that he didn't see it all happen. That's the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. Of course he knows it all, but there's no way you could imagine every last detailof what happened. And there were so many conversations: Karina and I spoketogether in private, and we talked with Mamma, too. But Father was neverpresent at those conversations. We spare him that, if you can say that. Andwhen the investigator comes to the house, we don't speak with Father present.On February 29, the next clay, Karina and I were discharged from the hospital.First they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city, the soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier. There were many people there, Armenian victims. I met the Tovmasian family there. From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died. They were sure that both had died. They were talking to me and Raya, Rafik's wife and Grant's daughter, and her mother, were both crying.Then they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard.There's a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area.They took us in there. The women were afraid to go because they thoughtthat they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had becomeso dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide.The women were shouting. They explained to them: "We want to hide youbetter because it's possible there will be an attack on the police precinct."We went into the little house. There were no chairs or tables in there. Wehad children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to have their diapers changed. No one had anything with them. It was just awful. They kept us there for 24 hours. From the window of the one room house you could see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the police precinct, as though they were spying on us. The police precinct is surrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it's electrified, but if they were standing on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. This brought great psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn't just walked out of their apartments, but who hadn't slept for 24 hours, or 48,or those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost family members. For us it was another ordeal. We were especially frightened when all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. We couldn't see a singleperson, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. We thought that they musthave already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret room down there. People were panicking: they started throwing themselves atone another . . . That's the way it is on a sinking ship. We heard those people, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. We felt thatthe end was approaching. I was completely terrified: I had left Karina in the hospital and didn't know where my parents were. I was sort of calm about my parents, I was thinking only about Karina, if, Heaven forbid, they should attack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an Armenian in there, and something terrible would happen to Karina again, and she wouldn't be able to take it.Then soldiers with dogs appeared. When they saw the dogs some of the people climbed down off the fence. Then they brought in about another 30 soldiers.They all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. We calmed down a little. They brought us chairs and brought the children some little cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the childrento the toilet. But we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never have occurred to any of us that we hadn't eaten for two days and that people do eat.Then, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. They were being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. One of the men came back from the courtyard and told us about it. Raya Tovmasian . . . it was like a different woman had been substituted. Earlier she had been crying, wailing, and calling out: "Oh, Rafik!," but when she heard about this such a rage came over her! She jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her sleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. And suddenly there were soldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. She ran over to them. The bandits werestanding there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. She went upto one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash him! Then, on to a second, and a third. Everyone was rooted to the spot. Not one of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from doing it. And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands, muttering something. She came back and sat down, and something akin to a smileappeared on her face. She became so quiet: no tears, no cries. Then that roundwas over and she went back to beat them again. She was walking and cursing terribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the creeps, and so on. Then she came back again and sat down. She probably did this the whole night through, well, it wasn't really night, no one slept. She went five or six times and beat them and returned. And she told the women, "What are you sitting there for? They killed your husbands and children, they raped, and you're just sitting there. You're sitting and talking as though nothing had happened. Aren't you Armenians?" She appealed to everyone, but no one got up. I was just numb, I didn't have the strength to beat anyone, I could barely hold myself up, all the more so since I had been standing for so many hours--I was released at eleven o'clock in the morning and it was alreadyafter ten at night because there weren't enough chairs, really it was the elderly and women with children who sat. I was on my feet the whole time. There was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking. The situation was deplorable.At eleven o'clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen, Azerbaijanis. They said, "Get up. They've brought mattresses, you can wash upand put the children to bed." Now the women didn't want to leave this place, either. The place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with dogs. If anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, "Oh, it's our little family," and things like that. The soldiers felt this love, and probably, for the first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. Everyonespoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loadedmachine guns in their hands, said, "Grandmother, you mustn't approach me,I'm on guard." Our people would say, "Oh, that's all right." They huggedthem, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. This was all terriblymoving for me. And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs.They took us up to the second floor and said, "You can undress and sleep in here. Don't be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it's quiet in the city."This was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41A and in otherplaces. Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at theSK club and at the City Party Committee. They took us there. On the way I asked them to stop at the Maternity Home: I wanted to take Karina with me.I didn't know what was happening there. They told me, "Don't worry, theMaternity Home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. So you can restassured. I say, "Well, I won't rest assured regardless, because the staff inthere is capable of anything."When I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina hadalready been brought there. They had seen fit to release her from the hospi-tal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. Oncewe were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears. We met acquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who hadn't been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with them, and so on, and those, like me, like Raya, who were wearing whatever had come their way. There were even people who were all made up, dolled up like they had come from a wedding. There were people without shoes, naked people, hungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. And of course the stories and the talk were flying: "Oh, I heard that they killed him!" "What do you mean they killed him!" "He stayed at work!" "Do you know what's happening at this and such a plant? Talk like that.And then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian, the teacher. I know him very well and respect him highly. I've known him for a long time. They had a small room, well really it was more like a study-room. We spent a whole night talking in that study once. On March 1 we heard that Bagirov [First Secretary of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] had arrived. Everyone ran to see Bagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed from outside. He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask him things. Everyone was in a tremendous rage. But he was protected by soldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn't deign to speak with the people. Apparently he had more important things to do.Several hours passed. Gukasian called me and says, "Lyudochka, find another two or three. We're going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs, lists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people who had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned." I had about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, "Lyuda, your Mamma has arrived, she's looking for you, she doesn't believe that you are alive and well and that you're here." I gave the lists to someone and asked them to continue what I was doing and went off.The list was imprecise, of course. It included Grant Adamian, Raya Tovmasian'sfather, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. There was EngelsGrigorian's father and aunt, Cherkez and Maria. The list also included the name of my girlfriend and neighbor, Zhanna Agabekian. One of the guys said that he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in frontof the Kosmos movie theater. We put her on the list too, and cried, but later it turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she hadsomehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for Krasnovodsk, where, thank God, she was alive and well. I should also say that in addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored missing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead.                                                                 3All the lists were taken to Bagirov. I don't remember how many dead were contained in the list, but it's a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple of minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. I asked, "What's going on?" He said, "Lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrelsthey are! They say that they lost the list of the dead. Piotr Demichev[Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Partyof the USSR] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list tohim, so that he'd see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether itwas one or fifty." They told him that the list had disappeared and theyshould ask everyone who hadn't left for the Khimik boarding house all overagain. There were 26 people on our second list. I think that the number 26was the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, becausethat's the list that Demichev got. I remember exactly that there were 26 people on the list, I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only a half of those that were on the first list. He said, "Lyuda, please, try toremember at least one more." But I couldn't remember anyone else. But therewere more than 30 dead. Of that I am certain. The government and the Procuracydon't count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people whose lives are threatened by any shock. They weren't registered as victims ofthe Sumgait tragedy. And then there may be people we didn't know. So many people left Sumgait between March 1 and 8! Most of them left for smaller townsin Russia, and especially to the Northern Caucasus, to Stavropol, and the Krasnodarsk Territory. We don't have any information on them. I know that there are people who set out for parts around Moscow. In the periodical Krestyanka [Woman Farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk cows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and I know a whole group of people went to help out. Also clearly not on our list are those people who died enteringthe city, who were burned in their cars. No one knows about them, except the Azerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. And there'smore. A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list drawn up at the Procuracy. I know of three instances for sure, and I of coursedon't know them all. I'm thinking of three women whose parents chose not to publicize what had happened, that is, they didn't take the matter to court, they simply left. But in so doing they didn't cease being victims. One of themis the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. She lived in Microdistrict No. 8, on the fifth floor. I can't tell you the building number and I don't know her name. Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in Microdistrict 1 near the gift shop. I don't know her name, she lives on the same landing as the Sumgait procurator. They beat her father, he was holding the door while his daughter hid, but he couldn't hold the door forever, and when she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors' they seized her by her braid. Like the Azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because they didn't kill anyone, they only raped them and left. And the third one . . . I don't remember who the third one was anymore.They transferred us on March 1. Karina still wasn't herself. Yes, we lived fordays in the SK, in the cultural facility, and at the Khimik. They lived there and I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn't stay with Karina; it was too difficult for me, but I was at peace: she had survived. I could already walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. Thanks to the social work I did there, I managed to persevere. Aleksandr Mikhailovich said, "If it weren't for the work I would go insane." He and I put ourselves in gearand took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers and free food, and we went to get them. The first days we bought everything, although we should have received it for free. They were supposed to have been dispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. Then, when we found out it was free, we went to Krayev. At the time, fortunately, you could still drop byto see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearlyvisible on our faces. Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue.On March 2 they sent two investigators to see us: Andrei Shirokov and VladimirFedorovich Bibishev. The way it worked out, in our family they had considered only Karina and me victims, maybe because she and I wound up in the hospital.Mother and Father are considered witnesses, but not victims.Shirokov was involved with Karina's case, and Bibishev, with mine. After I told him everything, he and I planned to sit down with the identikit andrecord everyone I could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind. We didn't work with the identikit until the very last day because theconditions weren't there. The investigative group worked slowly and did poor quality work solely because the situation wasn't conducive to working: there weren't enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a curfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or video cameras. I think that this was done on purpose. We're not so poor that we can't supply our investigators with all that stuff. It was done especially to draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities sawthat the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to Sumgait. And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with Bibishev, I told him myself, "Don't you worry, if it takes us a month or two months, I'll be here. I'm not afraid, I looked death in the eyes five times inthose two days, I'll help you conduct the investigation."He and I worked together a great deal, and I used this to shelter Karina, Igave them so much to do that for a while they didn't have the time to get toher, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her-self. She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x-rays. She couldn't eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. I didn't eatand drank virtually nothing for five days. Then, on the fifth day, when wewere in Baku already, the investigator told me, "How long can you go on like this? Well fine, so you don't want to eat, you don't love yourself, you'renot taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see thisinvestigation through. We need you." Then I started eating, because in fact Iwas exhausted. It wasn't enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart-ment in my mind, every day I went to the investigative solitary confinementcells and prisons. I don't know . . . we were just everywhere! Probably inevery prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells ofSumgait. At that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary confinement.Thus far I have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment. Mamma identified three, and Karina, two. The total is 36. Marina didn't identify anyone, she remembers the faces of two or three, But they weren't among the photographs of those detained. I told of the neighbor I recognized. The one who went after the axe. He still hasn't been detained, he's still on the loose. He's gone, and it's not clear if he will be found or not. I don't know his first or last name. I know which building he lived in and I know his sisters' faces. But he's not in the city. The investigators informed me that even if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will continue looking for him.The 31 people I identified are largely blue-collar workers from various plants, without education, and of the very lowest level in every respect.Mostly their ages range from 20 to 30 years; there was one who was 48. Onlyone of them was a student. He was attending the Azerbaijan Petroleum andChemical Institute in Sumgait, his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga-tor. Once, thinking that I was an employee and not a victim, she said in frontof me "I'll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cashsimply for keeping him out of Armenia," that is, to keep him from landing ina prison on Armenian soil. They're all terribly afraid of that, because if theinvestigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn't confess eventhough we identified him, they tell him--in order to apply psychologicalpressure--they say, "Fine, don't confess, just keep silent. When you're in anArmenian prison, when they find out who you are, they'll take care of youin short order." That somehow gets to them. Many give in and start to talk.The investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entirepogrom of our apartment, as an investigative experiment. It was only thenthat I saw the way they had left our apartment. Even without knowing who was in our apartment, you could guess. They stole, for example, all the money and all the valuables, but didn't take a single book. They tore them up, burned them, poured water on them, and hacked them with axes. Only the Materialsfrom the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James Fenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohigans. Oh yes, lunch was ready, we were boiling a chicken, and there were lemons for tea on the table. After they had been in our apartment, both the chicken and the lemons were gone. That's enough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don'teven know anything about books. They didn't take a single book, but they did take worn clothing, food, and even the cheapest of the cheap, worn-out slippers.Of those whom I identified, four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait. Basically, the group that went seeking "revenge"--let's use their word for it--was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill-seekers. I talked with one of them. He had gray eyes, and somehow against the back-drop of all that black I remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes. Besides takingpart in the pogrom of our apartment, he was also involved in the murder of Tamara Mekhtiyeva from Building 16. She was an older Armenian who had recentlyarrived from Georgia, she lived alone and did not have anyone in Sumgait. I don't know why she had a last name like that, maybe she was married to an Azerbaijani. I had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice, and know nothing about her. I do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an axe. Murdering her wasn't enough for them. They hacked her into pieces and threw them into the tub with water.I remember another guy really well too, he was also rather fair-skinned. You know, all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark, both their hair and their skin. And in contrast with them, in addition to the grey-eyed one, I remember this one fellow, the one l took to be a Lezgin. I identified him. As it turned out he was Eduard Robertovich Grigorian, bornin the city of Sumgait, and he had been convicted twice. One of our own. How did I remember him? The name Rita was tattooed on his left or right hand. I kept thinking, is that Rita or "puma," which it would be if you read the word as Latin characters instead of Cyrillic, because the Cyrillic "T" was the one that looks like a Latin "M." When they led him in he sat with his hands behindhis back. This was at the confrontation. He swore on every holy book, tried toput in an Armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion, and told me that I was making a mistake, and called me "dear sister." He said, "You're wrong, how could I, an Armenian, raise my hand against my own, an Armenian," and so on. He spoke so convincingly that even the investigator asked me, "Lyuda, are you sure it was he?" I told him, "I'll tell you one moreidentifying mark. If I'm wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken. The name Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand." He went rigid and became pale. They told him, "Put your hands on the table." He put his hands on thetable with the palms up. I said, "Now turn your hands over," but he didn't turn his hands over. Now this infuriated me. If he had from the very startacknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn't wanted to do it, that they forced him or something else, I would have treated him somewhat differently.But he insolently stuck to his story, "No, I did not do anything, it wasn't me." When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on hishand. His face distorted and he whispered something wicked. I immediately flewinto a rage. There was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out of granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it. Catching myself quite by surprise, I hurled that ashtray at him. But he duckedand the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and back. And he smiled. When he smiled it provoked me further. I don't know how, but I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or strangling him; I no longer remember which. When I jumped I caught the microphone cord. The investigator was there, Tolya . . .I no longer recall hislast name, and he says, "Lyudochka, it's a Japanese microphone! Please . . ." And shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped. They took him away. I stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down, because we needed to go on working, I only remember Tolya telling me, "You're some actress! What a performance!" I said, "Tolya, honestly . . . " Beforehandthey would always tell me, "Lyuda, more emotion. You speak as calmly as if nothing had happened to you." I say, "I don't have any more strength or emotion. All my emotions are behind me now, I no longer have the strength . . . I don't have the strength to do anything." And he says, "Lyuda, how wereyou able to do that?" And when I returned to normal, drinking tea and watchingthe tape, I said, "Can I really have jumped over that table? I never jumped that high in gym class."So you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. Of the 36 we identified there was an Armenian, a Russian, Vadim Vorobyev, who beat Mamma, and 34 Azerbaijanis.At the second meeting with Grigorian, when he had completely confessed his guilt, he told of how on February 27 the Azerbaijanis had come knocking. Amongthem were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. They said, "Tomorrow we're going after the Armenians. Meet us at the bus station at threeo'clock." He said, "No, I'm not coming." They told him, "If you don't come we'll kill you." He said, "Alright, I'll come." And he went.They also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, Kamo Pogosian. Hehad also been in prison; I think that together they had either stolen a motorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. They called him out of his apartment and told him the same thing: "Tomorrow we're going to getthe Armenians. Be there." He said, "No." They pulled a knife on him. He said, "I'm not going all the same." And in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed him several times, in the stomach. He was taken to the hospital. I know he wasin the hospital in Baku, in the Republic hospital. If we had known about that we would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th.I'll return to Grigorian, what he did in our apartment. I remember that hebeat me along with all the rest. He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well. But hewas very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out forhim, too. But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burningof Shagen Sargisian. I don't know if he participated in the rapes in our apartment; I didn't see, I don't remember. But the people who were in our apartment who didn't yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did. I don't know if he confessed or not, and I myself don't recall because I blackedout very often. But I think that he didn't participate in the rape of Karinabecause he was in the apartment the whole time. When they carried her into thecourtyard, he remained in the apartment.At one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian. From herI learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is Russian, he doesn't have a father, and that he's been convicted twice. Well this will be his thirdand, I hope, last sentence. He beat his wife, she was eternally coming to workwith bruises. His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita.The others who were detained . . . well they're little beasts. You really can'tcall them beasts, they're just little beasts. They were robots carrying outsomeone else's will, because at the investigation they all said, "I don't understand how I could have done that, I was out of my head." But we know thatthey were won around to it and prepared for it, that's why they did it. In thename of Allah, in the name of the Koran, in the name of propagating Islam--that's holy to them--that's why they did everything they were commanded to do.Because I saw they didn't have minds of their own, I'm not talking about theirlevel of cultural sophistication or any higher values. No education, theywork, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they crowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were promised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments.So off they went. Many of them explained their participation saying, "they promised us apartments."Among them was one who genuinely repented. I am sure that he repented from theheart and that he just despised himself after the incident. He worked at a children's home, an Azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at the children's home too. Everything that they acquired, everything that they have they earned by their own labor, and wasn't inherited from parents or grandparents. And he said, "I didn't need anything I just don't know . . . howI ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. I had no will of my own, I had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing." And the whole time Ikept repeating, "Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife right before your own eyes." He sat there and just wailed.But that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. He performed a marvelous disappearing act, but I think that they'll get onto him, they just have to work a little, because that Vadim, that boy, according to hisgrandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how to cover his tracks. He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he knew and those he didn't, either, and other things as well, and changed himself like a chameleon so they wouldn't get onto him, but he was detained.That one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians' after Aleksandr Gambarian was murdered. He came in and said, "Let's go, enough, you've spilledenough blood here."Maybe Karina doesn't know this but the reason they didn't finish her off was that they were hoping to take her home with them. I heard this from Aunt Tanyaand her sons, the Kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. They liked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. When Karina came to at one point--she doesn't remember this yet, this the neighbors old me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to the entryway. They saw that she was still alive and came back, they were already at the third entryway, on their way to the Gambarians'. They came backand started beating her to finish her. If she had not come to she would have sustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. An older woman from our building, Aunt Nazan, an Azerbaijani, all but lay on top of Karina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off.The woman's grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands and led her home. She howled and cried out loudly and swore: God is on Earth, he sees everything, and He won't forgive this.There was another woman, too, Aunt Fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first floor, she's already retired. Mountain dwellers, and Azerbaijanis, too, have acustom: If men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them.But they trampled her scarf and sent her home. To trample a scarf is tantamount to trampling a woman's honor.Now that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we have gotten back to being ourselves a little, I think about how could these events that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen? How did they come about? How did it start? Could it have been avoided? Well, it's clear that without a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not have happened. All the same, I'm not afraid to say this, the Azerbaijanis,let other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their nations, let them take no offense, but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are a people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution forwhat they have done. And when the law said that they could do all that, likeunleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn't have time to do everything, they threw themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done,to snatch a bit more. The smell of the danger was already in the air onFebruary 27. You could tell that something was going to happen. And everyone who had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. Many leftfor their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just gotas far away as their legs would carry them.February 27 was a Saturday. I was teaching my third class. The director came into my classroom and said that I should let the children out, that there had been a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for a meeting at Lenin Square. Well, I excused the children, and there were few teachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or seven men. The rest had already gone home. We got to Lenin Square and there were a great many people there. This was around five-thirty or six in the evening, no later. They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and the crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. They spoke over the microphone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the driver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijanichild off the bus. The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he hadseen it himself..The crowd started to rage: "Death to the Armenians! They mustbe killed!" Then a woman went up on stage. I didn't see the woman because people were clinging to the podium like flies. I could only hear her. The woman introduced herself as coming from Kafan, and said that the Armenians cut her daughters' breasts off, and called, "Sons, avenge my daughters!" That was enough. A portion of the people on the square took off running in the direction of the factories, toward the beginning of Lenin Street.We stood there about an hour. Then the director of School 25 spoke, he gave a very nationalist speech. He said, "Brother Muslims, kill the Armenians!" This he repeated every other sentence. When he said this the crowd supported him stormily, whistling and shouting "Karabagh!" He said, "Karabagh has been our territory my whole life long, Karabagh is my soul. How can you tear out my heart?" As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh. "It's our territory, the Armenians will never see it. The Armenians must be eliminated. From time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians, fromtime immemorial, that's the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years the Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth." By filth he meant Armenians.I heard this. Before that I hadn't been listening to the speeches closely.Many people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with the other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn't penetrate,that in fact something serious was taking place. Then, when one of ourteachers said, "Listen to what he's saying, listen to what idiocy he's spouting," we listened. That was the speech of that director. Before that we listened to the woman's speech.Right then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the subject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. Our director ofstudies, for whom I had great respect, he's an Azerbaijani . . . Before that Ihad considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to obtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. So he tells me,"Lyuda, you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square? If they find out that you're an Armenian they'll tear you to pieces. Should I tell them you're an Armenian? Should I tell them you're an Armenian?" When he said it the first time I pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a second time. I turned to the director, Khudurova, and said that it was alreadyafter eight, I was expected at home, and I should be leaving. She answered, "No, they said that women should stay here until ten o'clock,.and men, until twelve. Stay here." There was a young teacher with us, her children were in kindergarten and her husband worked shifts. She asked to leave: "I left my children at the kindergarten." The director excused her. When she let her go Iturned around, said, "Good-bye," and left with the young teacher, the Azerbaijani. I didn't see them after that.When we were walking the buses weren't running, and a crowd from the rally rannearby us. They had apparently gotten all fired up. It must have become too much for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed off. I wasn't afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher wouldn't say that I was an Armenian.To make it short, we reached home. Then Karina told of how they had been at the movies and what had happened there. I started telling of my experience andagain my parents didn't understand that we were in danger. We watched television as usual, and didn't even imagine that tomorrow would be our last day. That's how it all was.At the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance, we went to school together,Zhanna, I don't remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store on Narimanov Street. She was there with her father, for some reason she doesn't have a mother. The two of them were at home alone. While her father held the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the ground was wet and that there wasn't anyone behind the building when she went out on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the entryway. That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders there. She jumped. She jumped and didn't feel any pain in the heat of the moment. A few days later I found out that she couldn't stand up, she had been injured somehow. That's how people in Sumgait saved their lives, their honor, and their children: any way they could. Where it was possible, the Armenians fought back. My father's first cousin, Armen M., lives in Block 30. They found out by phone from one of the victims what was going on in town. The Armenians in that building all called one another immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even with muskets and went up to the roof. They took their infants with them, and their old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months, they got them right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. They hooked electricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. Then they took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she's an Azerbaijani who lived in their building. They called the school board directorand told her that if she didn't help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to escape alive and unharmed, she'd never see her daughter again. I'm sure, of course, that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the onlything that could have saved them at the time. She called the police. The Armenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. Two armored personnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway andled everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored personnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that very moment, into Block 30. That's how they defended themselves.I heard that our neighbors, Roman and Sasha Gambarian, resisted. They're big, strong guys. Their father was killed. And I heard that the brothers put up a strong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother.One of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking for the criminals on March 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected, people hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps dead. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went with the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found Azerbaijani corpses. I don't know how many. Even if they had been wounded and put down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or infection--that basement was filled with water. I heard this from the neighbors. And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject came up and they confirmed it. I know, too, that for several hours the basement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. And our neighborcarried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing as one of the criminals. Everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor took his, too, and carried it home. And when we came back, when everything seemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing of ours he had managed to "save."Raya's husband and father defended themselves. The Trdatovs defended themselves, and so did other Armenian families. To be sure there wereAzerbaijani victims, although we'll never hear anything about them. For some reason our government doesn't want to say that the Armenians were not just victims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too. In the TV show "Pozitsiya" [Viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that the Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. But that's not important, the truth will come out regardless.So that's the price we paid those three days. For three days our courage, our bravery, and our humanity was tested. It was those three days, and not the years and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we've become, what we grew up to be. Those three days showed who was who.On that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy. It should be saidthat it's not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishmentsreceived by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans will depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the Procuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga-tion. That's the price we paid to live in Armenia, to not fear going out on the street at night, to not be afraid to say we're Armenians, and to not fearspeaking our native tongue.

Referring to notes from the personal diary of Russian General L. Odishe Liyetze on the Turkish front, he wrote,"On the nights 11-12 March, 1918 alone Armenian butchers  bayoneted and axed to death 3000 Muslims in areas surrounding Erzincan. These barbars threw their victims into pits, most likely dug according to their sinister plans to extinguish  Muslims, in groups of 80. My adjutant counted and unearthed 200 such pits. This is an act against our world of civilization."On March 12, 1918 Lieut-colonel Griyaznof wrote (from an officialRussian account of the Turkish genocide),"Roads leading to villages were littered with bayoneted torsos, dismembered joints and carved out organs of Muslim peasants... alas! mainly of women and children."Source: Doc. Dr. Azmi Suslu, "Russian View on the Atrocities Committed        by the Armenians Against the Turks," Ankara Universitesi, Ankara,        1987, pp. 45-53.

(Acting Commander of Erzurum and Deveboynu regions and Commander        of the Second Erzurum Artillery Regiment Prisoner of War,        Lieutenant Colonel Toverdodleyov)"The things I have heard and seen during the two months, until the liberation of Erzurum by the Turks, have surpassed all the allegations concerning the vicious, degenerate characteristic of the Armenians. During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian was permitted to approach the city and its environs. While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to  attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers who had remained in the rear during the war. One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud, and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud and dirt... It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The  Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently. Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days. The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned. ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief, Odishelidge. They were as follows: The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades... More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless  Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood  near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses: 'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.' Thus ten more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when the hole was full it would be covered over with soil. The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one. Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and destroyed the entire population, together with the villages. During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the  Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the  Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with hatred and loathing. Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping him with the iron heel of his boot. Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following: There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads. Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about 25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140  centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age, children and old people. The women's bodies had obvious marks of rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder. A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be  proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel's disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle, instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers, the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and claimed they had laughed because they were nervous. An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command narrated the following incident which took place on February 20: The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head. The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men  of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people among this group were able to save their lives as the result of my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were  released when they learnt that I understood what was going on.  Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered on the streets. On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for murdering an innocent Turk.  When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would  be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: 'How dare you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?' In Erzurum, the  Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same  day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible act. However no result was achieved. In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the  Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular.  The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre. However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders of the leading Armenian figures and commanders.  I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority. Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by the Russians of infamy, would say the following: 'You are Russians. You can never understand the Armenian cause.' The Armenians had a conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear of the Turkish soldiers. The incidents that occurred only recently clearly manifest the real nature of the Armenian ideology. Nothing which is already done can be undone."Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists                             a single Turkish soul.' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)
