Some of the GRBs have very short rise times (< 1ms).  We could detect the curvature of the burst wavefront out to adistance of on the order of b^2/(t c) where b is the detector spacingand t the time resolution.  For t = 1 ms and b = 2 AU, this is on theorder of 16 light years.  I understand statistics will reduce thisnumber considerably, as would geometry if the burst is coming from thewrong direction.Paul

The Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list for sci.space and sci.astro isposted approximately monthly. It also covers many questions that come up onsci.space.shuttle (for shuttle launch dates, see below).    The FAQ is posted with a long expiration date, so a copy may be in yournews spool directory (look at old articles in sci.space). If not, here aretwo ways to get a copy without waiting for the next posting:    (1) If your machine is on the Internet, it can be obtained by anonymousFTP from the SPACE archive at ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) in directorypub/SPACE/FAQ.    (2) Otherwise, send email to 'archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov'containing the single line:help    The archive server will return directions on how to use it. To get anindex of files in the FAQ directory, send email containing the lines:send space FAQ/Indexsend space FAQ/faq1    Use these files as a guide to which other files to retrieve to answeryour questions.    Shuttle launch dates are posted by Ken Hollis periodically insci.space.shuttle. A copy of his manifest is now available in the Amesarchive in pub/SPACE/FAQ/manifest and may be requested from the emailarchive-server with 'send space FAQ/manifest'. Please get this documentinstead of posting requests for information on launches and landings.    Do not post followups to this article; respond to the author.

America's future in science andtechnology and as a world leader in space demands our utmostattention and care," said Vest. "We have assembled a diversepanel of experts that, I believe, will bring the appropriatemeasures of insight, integrity and objectivity to this criticaltask."The advisory committee is charged with independently assessingvarious redesign options of the space station presented by NASA'sredesign team, and proposing recommendations to improveefficiency and effectiveness of the space station program. Spacestation international partners also are being asked to participate and will be named at a later date. The advisorycommittee will submit its recommendations in June.Advisory committee members named today include:Dr. Charles Vest              Dr. Bobby AlfordPresident, MIT                Executive VP & Dean of Medicine                              Baylor College of MedicineMr. Jay Chabrow               Dr. Paul ChuPresident, JMR Associates     Director, Texas Center for                              Superconductivity                              University of HoustonDr. Ed Crawley                Dr. John FabianProf of Aero & Astro          President & CEOMIT                           ANSERMaj.

But thanksto major design refinements implemented in recent months, JPL'sSpace Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) -- a major projectconsidered to be in trouble a couple of years ago -- is "aliveand well," according to Project Scientist Michael Werner.     A lighter spacecraft, revised orbit and shorter mission haveadded up to a less expensive project with "tremendous scientificpower" and a bright future, said Werner.     Designed as a follow-up to the highly successful InfraredAstronomical Satellite (IRAS) and Cosmic Background Explorer(COBE) missions, SIRTF -- a cryogenically cooled observatory forinfrared astronomy from space -- is scheduled for launch in 2000or 2001 if plans proceed as scheduled.     IRAS' pioneering work in space-based infrared astronomy 10years ago allowed astronomers to view the Milky Way as neverbefore and revealed, among other things, 60,000 galaxies and 25comets. It provided a sky survey 1,000 times more sensitive thanany previously available from ground-based observations. COBE hasmeasured the infrared and microwave background radiation on largeangular scales, and revealed new facts about the early universe.     But to illuminate SIRTF's potential, Jim Evans, JPL'smanager of Astrophysics and Fundamental Physics Pre-Projects,recently said that the project is "1,000 to 1 million times morecapable than IRAS," based on technological advances in infrareddetector arrays.     However, despite the enormous strides in infraredexploration SIRTF promised, and the fact that it was cited as thehighest priority new initiative for all of astronomy in the 1990s(by the National Academy of Sciences), it took a "diet or die"directive from NASA Headquarters last year to keep the projectgoing, according to Werner.     The project is now known as Atlas SIRTF, based on the keyfactor in its new design: The satellite will orbit the suninstead of the Earth, permitting the use of an Atlas rocketlaunch instead of the formerly proposed and heavier Titan. "Themain advantage of the solar orbit is that you can use all of yourlaunch capability for boosting the payload -- you don't have tocarry up a second rocket to circularize the orbit," Werner said.The other advantage to a solar orbit, he said, is that "it's in abetter thermal environment, away from the heat of the Earth."     Additional major changes in SIRTF's redesign includeshortening the mission from five to three years and building aspacecraft that is less than half as heavy as in the originalplan -- Atlas SIRTF will weigh 2,470 kilograms (5,400 pounds)compared to Titan SIRTF's 5,500 kilograms (12,100 pounds).     All of that adds up to "a less stressful launchenvironment," Werner said, and a cost savings of more than $200million for the launch, in addition to increased savings in thedesign of the smaller, less massive spacecraft.     Werner said SIRTF's redesign came as a result of Congress'telling NASA "you're trying to do too many things. If you want usto support SIRTF, which is a good project, develop a plan to seehow it fits into (NASA's) overall strategy."     Shortly thereafter, SIRTF was named as NASA's highestpriority "flagship" scientific mission by the interdisciplinarySpace Sciences Advisory Committee, in addition to the blessingfrom the National Academy of Sciences.     While the spacecraft and its instruments required descopingto keep the project alive, SIRTF's major scientific contributionalways promised to come about from its advanced infrared detectorarrays, which will allow images to be developed "tens ofthousands of times faster" than before, according to Evans.     "Up until a couple of years ago," Werner said, "all infraredastronomy was done with single detectors -- or very small arraysof individually assembled detectors. Since then, the Departmentof Defense has developed a program to produce arrays of tens orhundreds of thousands of detectors, rather than just a few, andthose are very well suited for use on SIRTF."     Werner noted that in addition to dealing with budgetpressures, Congress is currently watching NASA projects with aneye out for any "technological spinoff."     "On that question, I think we have some things to say," hesaid, "because the detectors we're using are straight off variousmilitary developments. Also, SIRTF will be built by the U.S.aerospace industry, and it's a real technological and engineeringchallenge in addition to being a tremendous scientific project.     "SIRTF will be used by the entire astronomical community,"Werner added, but the revised three-year mission "puts a premiumon observing time. We have to educate the user community anddevelop a program that involves early surveys and quickturnaround of the data."     Werner said the downsizing of the project required areduction in scope and complexity of SIRTF's three instruments --the infrared spectrograph, infrared array camera and multibandimaging photometer. However, these reductions will only result inlosses of efficiency rather than capability, he said.     The project hopes to start a "Phase B" activity in 1995,which will provide a detailed concept for development and design.Building the hardware would begin about two years later.     Projected cost estimates, Evans said, are $850 million-$950million.     "I am very optimistic about SIRTF," he said. "It willprovide a tremendous return for the investment."     Werner added that an additional benefit from the projectwill be the "enrichment of our intellectual and culturalenvironment. People on the street are very interested inastronomy ... black holes, the possibility of life on otherplanets, the origin of the universe ... and those are the kind ofquestions SIRTF will help answer."                              ###     ___    _____     ___    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

But why?  The Saturn V took less than six years, depending onexactly when you date its start.  Pegasus took about three from projectstart to first flight.  Before SDIO chickened out on orbital development,the target date for an orbital DC-Y flight was 1996.  If you really wantspeed, consider that the first prototypes of the Thor missile (still inservice as the core of the Delta launcher) shipped to the USAF lessthan 18 months after the development go-ahead.One of the most pernicious myths in this whole business is the beliefthat you can't build a launcher without taking ten years and spendingbillions of dollars.  It isn't true and never was.

It was easy to imagine himtaking practical steps to modify the sodium lamps on the streetoutside Mill Hill observatory with a 12-gauge shotgun :-)However, seriously, it is possible to limit the effects ofstreetlights, by adding a reflector, so that the light onlyilluminates the ground, which is after all where you need it. As abonus, the power consumption required for a given illumination levelis reduced. Strangely enough, astronomers often seek to lobby electedlocal authorities to use such lighting systems, with considerablesuccess in the desert areas around the major US observatories. Atleast, thats what McNally told us, all those years ago.( British local authorities couldn`t care less, as far as I can see )I suppose that the "right" to dark skies is no more than an aspiration,but it is a worthwhile one. Illuminated orbital billboards seem especiallyyukky, and are presumably in the area of international law, if any, althoughI do find the idea of a right to bear anti-satellite weapons intriguing.-- __._____.___._____.__._________________________________________________________|_. ._| ._|_._._|__| Peter Card, Joint European Torus, Abingdon    | | | |_. | |    | Oxfordshire OX14 3EA UK. tel 0235-464867 FAX 464404    | | |  _| | |    | email pjc@jet.uk or compuserve 100010,366   ._| | | |_. | |    | It wasnt me.

It's more likely that the Moon will neverbe the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has nomaterials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroidsand comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in lowgrade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch, and it's position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it's heat sink capacity could offer some military utility for "high ground" militaryweapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space travel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as Mt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that's a very minor activity in the global scope of things.Luna has an inconvienent gravity field. It's likely too low to preventcalcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it'stoo high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factoriesthat can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Lunahas a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbitalsites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offersa source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink,and shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light andheavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravitywells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.We don't use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtuallyignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That's because we don't have todeal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much moreexpensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we'll use theeasier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a fewcenturies, if not much longer.Luna's main short term value would be as a place for a farside radioastronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the siteof a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system fordefending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first isunlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument.The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are goodenough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe forconventional warfare again. There's little glory in watching from abunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges.

All I said was that a right is whateveryou or somebody acting for you can enforce.  The Bill of Rights didn'tcome into effect until it was ratified by the states (and indirectly,the people); from that point it defined legal rights.

Thiokol provided me with samples and data ona reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations.  Solidmotor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of aluminum in the mix.  For example, the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percentAluminum.  The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure.The structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspectsome bubbling process is used to form it).  In other words, if you madea bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is whatyou get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires inall directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated intothe voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  Thefoamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant,so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The majorimprovement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is theprincipal failure mode for solid propellant.Dani Eder-- Dani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/Rt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.

I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere> evolve given a range of physical aspects of the planet.  The question> is what physical aspects simply disallow earth like conditions.This is a good question.  There are major blind spots in our understandingof what makes the earth habitable.  For example, why does the earth'satmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does?  The naiveanswer is "photosynthesis", but this is clearly incomplete.  Photosynthesisby itself can't make the atmosphere oxygenated, as the oxygen producedis consumed when the plants decay or are eaten.  What is neededis photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction ofthe resulting reduced material.On earth, this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organicmatter, mostly from oceanic sources.  However, this burial requirescontinental sediments (in the deep ocean, the burial rate is so slowthat most material is consumed before it can be sequestered).This suggests that a planet without large oceans, or a planet withoutcontinents undergoing weathering, will have a hard time accumulatingan oxygen atmosphere.  In particular, an all-ocean planet may have ahard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere.There is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth's atmospherehas been relatively stable over geological time, for a period at least2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric O2 toweathering in the absence of replenishment.  No convincing feedbackmechanism has been identified.  Perhaps the reason is the weakanthropic principle: if during the last 500 MYr or so, the oxygenlevel had dropped too low, we wouldn't be here to be wondering aboutit.Paul F.

That would _really_ make me sad.   Think for a moment about the technology required to do that.  By    the time they could make the Earth's sky look like Las Vegas,    the people could afford to go backpacking on the Moon. Round   trip costs for 500 kg to the Moon would be about the same as   5000 kg in a Low Earth "advertising" orbit: Very roughly the   same cost as a smallish billboard, therefore. If such ads were   to become common place, that would have to be a very low price...This is nonsense.  Its like saying that by the time commercialson television become commonplace every citizen will have their ownhour long nationally broadcast TV program.   There's always been a problem of having to get    away from civilization before you can really find "natural"   scenery. 100 years ago, this usually didn't take a trip   of over 5 miles. Today, most people would have to go 100 miles   or more. If we ever get to the point where we have billboards   on orbit, that essentially means that no place on Earth is still   "wild." While that may or may not be a good thing, the orbital   billboards aren't the problem: They are just a symptom of    growing, densely-populated civilization. Banning such ads will   not save your view of the night sky, because by the time    such ads could become widespread you will probably have trouble   finding a place without street lights, where you can _see_   the stars...The rest of your post is strange mishmash of "its already really bad"and "it doesn't really matter if it gets worse."  You should try tofigure out what you are really arguing for.  (Kneejerk anti-environ-mentalism?)-davidP.S.

Hence, 'pushing the envelope' becomes'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational)envelope'. Note that the envelope isn't precisely known until someone actuallyflies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point, all there areare the theoretical predictions.  Hence, one of the things test pilotsdo for a living is 'push the envelope' to find out how close thecorrespondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- inessence, 'pushing back' the edges of the theoretical envelope to wherethe airplane actually starts to fail to fly.  Note, too, that this isdone is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generallycarefully coreographed and just what is going to be 'pushed' and howfar is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans,such as the 'early' first flight of the F-16 during its high-speedtaxi tests).I'm sure Mary can tell you everything you ever wanted to know aboutthis process (and then some).-- "Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live in the real world."   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden------------------------------------------------------------------------------Fred.McCall@dseg.ti.com - I don't speak for others and they don't speak for me.

Good stuff!This is actually more like the stuff from Phase A and MOL....Phase B endedwith a "Power Tower" approach....It's also VERY expensive in terms of upfront development costs....so allyou get is a redistribution of costs from the shuttle flights to thecontractors who build it.

Silicon was less  effective then the germanium  productsthen available.   GaAs  was less capable then Silicon.  Multi-processorswere slower then  existent single processors.What the argument was, though was that these new technologies promised eithertheoretically future higher performance  or lower cost or higher densities.I think that the DC-1  may g=fit into this same model.ELV's can certainly launch more weight  then  a SSRT,  but an SSRT offers the prospect of  greater cycle times and  lower costs.This is kind of a speculative posting,  but I thought i'd throw it out asa hjistorical framework  for those interested in the project.pat

Gamma Ray Spectrometer Random Access Memorywas successfully reloaded on Monday, April 19.  To prepare forMagnetometer Calibrations which were rescheduled for execution in FlightSequence C9 on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week, a reload of PayloadData System Random Access Memory will take place this morningbeginning at 10:30 AM.Over this weekend, the Flight Team will send real-time commands toperform Differential One-Way Ranging to obtain additional data foranalysis by the Navigation Team.  Radio Science Ultra Stable Oscillatortesting will take place on Monday .The Flight Sequence C9 uplink will occur on Sunday, April 25, withactivation at Midnight, Monday evening April 26.  C9 has been modified toinclude Magnetometer Calibrations which could not be performed in C8 dueto Contingency Mode entry on April 9.  These Magnetometer instrumentcalibrations will allow the instrument team to better characterize thespacecraft-generated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument.This information is critical to Martian magnetic field measurementswhich occur during approach and mapping phases. MAG Cals will requirethe sequence to command the spacecraft out of Array Normal Spin stateand perform slew and roll maneuvers to provide the MAG team data pointsin varying spacecraft attitudes and orientations.Today, the spacecraft is 22,971,250 km (14,273,673 mi.) from Marstravelling at a velocity of 2.09 kilometers/second (4,677 mph) withrespect to Mars.  One-way light time is approximately 10 minutes, 38seconds.     ___    _____     ___    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild>idea" stage or does it have real funding?      Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of theCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:  SPACE ADVERTISING    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is verycommon practice to put the cooperating organization's logos on thespace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the(very prominent) logos on its side of   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and   - the GPS/Navstar program office   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that onlyorganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on theside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, puttinga 10' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the camerasis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in myopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle hasrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentialsfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing largeadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know ofseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980's which looked atputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payloadbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", inthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firmsparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums forthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (Forexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting aDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameraswould scan past it.)  ADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowedto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoecompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,Soviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the lastOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items fromparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, forexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of theBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launchvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMETrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisementson the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger's upcoming movie "The LastAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participatingorganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on themain fuselage of the mission's Conestoga rocket, its boosterrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth forone month.  A concept for this advertising display was published inSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, istalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea hecreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertisingsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for thespace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space onthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not usehis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA andreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launchis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of theadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program iscoming from NASA.)  ORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction forsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and RobertHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Severaldifferent potential projects have been developed, although none havebeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "EiffelII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture inorbit to celebrate the French Republic's Bi-centennial.

But, so the reasoning continues, this energy       is released below a lot of matter, so the radiation becomes      thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum.      The observed spectra are strongly non-thermal, so this model must      be wrong."As so often, the fault lies with the imagination of the person whowas trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model. Itmay be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-rayburst, but the 'fireball' of energy and matter that is createdmay spew out a relativistic flow. When this slams into the surrounding medium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which maycarry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. Allthis is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees,Peter Meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers.It is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best onearound (summing over all proposed distance scales). An alternativeproposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the so-called 'failed supernovae' scenario by Stan Woosley, in whicha very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a blackhole. If the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matterwill be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugalforce, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto theblack hole. This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis,which again constitutes relativistic flow. The rate of suchevents may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers,but the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rateof bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the twoscenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot lessin the failed supernova scenario.On another note: I do believe that the distance scale must ultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical methodsuch as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths,or finding a definitive signature of some known class ofobjects in the distribution of positions and fluxes. Theoristshave historically not been too successfull in finding thedistance of any object by proving that there is only onepossible way in which the object can work, and thereforeit *must* be so-and-so.Ralph Wijers

We are seeking your ideas in these areas:    (1)  Potential commercial use of remote sensing data and images;    (2)  Potential noncommercial use of remote sensing data and images in        education (especially levels K-12) and other noncommercial areas;   (3)  Types of on-line capabilities and protocols to make the data more        accessible;   (4)  Additional points of contacts for ideas; and    (5)  Addresses and names  from whom to request proposals.  For your convenience, a standard format for responses is included below.  Feelfree to amend it as necessary.  Either e-mail or fax your responses to us byMay 5, 1993. E-MAIL:   On Internet "rsdwg@orion.ossa.hq.nasa.gov"  ASCII  - No binary attachments please FAX:   Ernie Lucier, c/o RSDWG, NASA HQ, FAX 202-358-3098 Survey responses in the following formats may also be placed in the FTP directory ~ftp/pub/RSDWG on orion.nasa.gov.  Please indicate the format. Acceptable formats are: Word for Windows 2.X, Macintosh Word 4.X and 5.X, and RTF.     ----------------------------RESPONSE FORMAT-------------------------- REQUEST FOR IDEAS FOR APPLICATIONS OF REMOTE SENSING DATABASES VIA THE INTERNET (1)  Potential commercial use of remote sensing data and images  (if possible,identify the relevant types of data or science products, user tools, andstandards).       (2)  Uses of remote sensing data and images in education (especially levelsK-12) and other noncommercial areas (if possible, identify the relevant typesof data or science products, user tools, and standards).        (3)  Types of on-line capabilities and protocols to make the data and imagesmore accessible (if possible, identify relevant types of formats, standards,and user tools)       (4)  Additional suggested persons or organizations that may be resources for further ideas on applications areas.  Please include: Name, Organization, Address and Telephone Number.       (5)  Organizations, mailing lists (electronic and paper), periodicals, etc. towhom a solicitation for proposals should be sent when developed.  Please include: Name, Organization, Address and Telephone Number.   (6)  We would benefit from knowing why users that know about NASA remote sensing data do not use the data.  Is it because they do not have ties to NASAinvestigators, or high cost, lack of accessibility, incompatible data formats,poor area of interest coverage, inadequate spatial or spectral resolution, ...?     (7)  In case we have questions, please send us your name, address, phone number(and e-mail address if you have one).  If you don't wish to send us thisinformation, feel free to respond to the survey anonymously.  Thank you foryour assistance.

In short,an orbiting billboard would be trash, in the same way that a billboard onthe Earth is trash.  Billboards make a place look trashy.  That is why thereare laws in many places prohibiting their use.  The light pollutioncomplaints are mainly an attempt to find some tangible reason to be againstorbiting billboards because people don't feel morally justified to complainon the grounds that these things would defile the beauty of the sky.Regular orbiting spacecraft are not the same in this respect, since they aremore like abstract entities, but a billboard in space would be like a beercan somebody had thrown on the side of the road: just trash._____________Dale M.

While slightly more worrisome, I'd like to point out thatany significant scattering of light outside the target area for one ofthese mirrors would be wasted as far as the project would beconcerned, and something any project like that would work againstanyway. And given some of the likely targets, I don't think there'sgoing to be much of an outcry from the inhabitants. There is too muchdark sky in the northern CIS during the winter, and I doubt you'll findmany activists in Murmansk demanding the "natural" sky back. If anything,he'll probably be inside, stripped buck naked in front of the UV lamp,making sure he'll get enough vitamin D for the "day."The mirror experiments aren't something they're doing for crassadvertising. They think that if they can build one, it'll be one ofthose things people in the affected areas will think they couldn'thave lived without before.

I love this topic, as some of you regulars know.So, having seen Henry's encouraging statement about starting to talkabout it; I shall.I feel that we as a community of people have unique resourcesto deliver to the world a comprehensive book which can elaborateon the utility of spaceflight to fields which are as divergent as medical intensive care, agriculture, environmental protection, and probably more.  I do not believe that the general public understandsthe impact of spaceflight on the whole of society.  In the absenceof such knowledge, we see dwindling support of the world's space effort.I believe that we as a group have the responsibility to not onlycommunicate amongst ourselves, but also with others through print media.A well-orchestrated and technically oriented analysis of life sciencevariables required to support long-duration spaceflight (like longexpenditions to the moon or Mars) would be entertaining and educationalto the general public.  The objective of such an effort would be to compile resources and publications from accepted scientific and technicaljournals which would address each major life science area.  In addition,ideas for further research and development could be put forward forthe general public to ponder...allowing the general public to takepart in the excitement of exploration.Individuals interested should be willing to devote an hour per weekto running literature searches and finding journal articles.  In addition,we need to obtain the assistance of personnel from within the hallsof NASA and industry.I have appreciated the positive responses to date and I am personallyeager to start this project.  Perhaps we could start with debate regardinghow best to grade the viability of various technologies for applicationto spaceflight.ken

This time we want to make a payload that can be recovered.We want to build it from "off the shelf" technology so as to do this asquickly and inexpensively as possible.  We want to be able to track thepayload after it has deployed its parachute.  An idea we have is to put thesame kind of radio beacon on it that is used with SARSATs (Search and RescueSatellites).  It would turn on with the opening of the parachute and aid intracking.  These beacons are known in the marine industry as EPIRBs(Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon).  They are rugged (they have tobe to survive a ship wreck!) and cheap.  We have several questions:1.  What is the world authority regulating the use of SARSAT beacons.  Arethere multiple authorites, i.e. military and civilian?2.  What are the regulations regarding the use of SARSAT signals.  Can theybe used for one of a kind situations with a long lead time of warning therelevant authorities, or are they strictly reserved for life threateningemergencies?3.  What is the coverage of SARSATS?  Are they in LEO with only intermittantcoverage of a fixed position on the earth, or are they in geosynchronousorbit?4.

Electronic mail may be sent    between these networks, and other resources available on one of these    networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to    special 'servers'.    The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of    several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.    One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central    distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In    addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for    Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more    specialized mailing lists described below.    A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews'. This is somewhat like a bulletin    board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews    separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a    'group name'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are    called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro',    and 'talk.politics.space'. Contributors 'post' submissions (called    'articles' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends    it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby    machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so    that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet    sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was    posted.    Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and    BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not    accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more    flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make    it the preferred option.MAILING LISTS    SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the    International Space University (in only its second change of management    in over a decade). Email space-request@isu.isunet.edu (message body    should be in the format 'subscribe space John Public') to join. Note    that the moderated SPACE Magazine list is defunct at present for lack of    a moderator. Old copies of SPACE Digest since its inception in 1981 are    available by anonymous FTP. Retrievejulius.cs.qub.ac.uk:pub/SpaceDigestArchive/README    for further details.    Elements is a moderated list for fast distribution of Space Shuttle    Keplerian Elements before and during Shuttle flights. NASA two line    elements are sent out on the list from Dr. Kelso, JSC, and other sources    as they are released. Email to elements-request@telesoft.com to join.    GPS Digest is a moderated list for discussion of the Global Positioning    System and other satellite navigation positioning systems. Email to    gps-request@esseye.si.com to join.    Space-investors is a list for information relevant to investing in    space-related companies. Email Vincent Cate (vac@cs.cmu.edu) to join.    Space-tech is a list for more technical discussion of space topics;    discussion has included esoteric propulsion technologies, asteroid    capture, starflight, orbital debris removal, etc. Email to    space-tech-request@cs.cmu.edu to join. Archives of old digests and    selected excerpts are available by anonymous FTP from    gs80.sp.cs.cmu.edu (128.2.205.90) in /usr/anon/public/space-tech,    or by email to space-tech-request if you don't have FTP access.    SEDS-L is a BITNET list for members of Students for the Exploration and    Development of Space and other interested parties. Email    LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET with a message saying "SUBSCRIBE SEDS-L your    name". Email saying "INDEX SEDS-L" to list the archive contents.    SEDSNEWS is a BITNET list for news items, press releases, shuttle status    reports, and the like. This duplicates material which is also found in    Space Digest, sci.space, sci.space.shuttle, and sci.astro. Email    LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET saying "SUBSCRIBE SEDSNEWS your name" to join.    Email saying "INDEX SEDSNEWS" to list the archive contents.    Ron Baalke (baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov) runs a mailing list which    carries the contents of the sci.space.news Usenet group. Email him    to join the list.    As a general note, please mail to the *request* address to get off a    mailing list. SPACE Digest, for example, relays many inappropriate    'please remove me from this list' messages which are sent to the list    address rather than the request address.PERIODICALLY UPDATED INFORMATION    In addition to this FAQ list, a broad variety of topical information is    posted to the net (unless otherwise noted, in the new group    sci.space.news created for this purpose).

Larson, 1984, North           Pacific Publishers, Portland, Oregon, 456 pages, indexed,           hardcover.                          "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION" contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to           most ALL astrophysical mysteries.                          This book is Volume III of a revised and enlarged           edition of "THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE", 1959.            Volume I is "NOTHING BUT MOTION" (1979), and Volume II is           "THE BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER" (1988).                          Most books and journal articles on the subject of           astrophysics are bristling with integrals, partial           differentials, and other FANCY MATHEMATICS.  In this book, by           contrast, mathematics is conspicuous by its absence, except           for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text.            Larson emphasizes CONCEPTS and declares that mathematical           agreement with a theory does NOT guarantee its conceptual           validity.                          Dewey B. Larson was a retired engineer with a Bachelor           of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State           University.  He developed the Theory described in his books           while trying to find a way to MATHEMATICALLY CALCULATE the           properties of chemical compounds based ONLY on the elements           they contain.                          "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION" describes the astrophysical           portions of Larson's CONSISTENT, INTEGRATED, COMPREHENSIVE,           GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, a kind of           "grand unified field theory" that orthodox physicists and           astro-physicists CLAIM to be looking for.  It is built on two           postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of           space and time:                          (1) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE           component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE           units, and with two RECIPROCAL aspects, SPACE and TIME.                          (2) The physical universe conforms to the relations of           ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its primary magnitudes are           ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.                          From these two postulates, Larson was able to build a           COMPLETE theoretical universe, from photons and subatomic           particles to the giant elliptical galaxies, by combining the           concept of INWARD AND OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with           translational, vibrational, rotational, and rotational-          vibrational motions.  At each step in the development, he was           able to match parts of his theoretical universe with           corresponding parts in the real physical universe, including           EVEN THINGS NOT YET DISCOVERED.  For example, in his 1959           book, he first predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES,           several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them.  They           are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of his comprehensive Theory.  And           when quasars were discovered, he had a related explanation           ready for those also.                          As a result of his theory, which he called "THE           RECIPROCAL SYSTEM", Larson TOTALLY REJECTED many of the           sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists,           including black holes, neutron stars, degenerate matter,           quantum wave mechanics (as applied to atomic structure),           "nuclear" physics, general relativity, relativistic mass           increases, relativistic Doppler shifts, nuclear fusion in           stars, and the big bang, all of which he considered to be           nothing more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES.  He was very           critical of the AD HOC assumptions, uncertainty principles,           solutions in principle, "no other way" declarations, etc.,           used to maintain them.                          "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION" is divided into 31 chapters.            It begins with a description of how galaxies are built from           the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters,           which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that           accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in           from the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe.  (Galaxy           formation from the MYTHICAL "big bang" is a big mystery to           orthodox astronomers.)  He then goes on to describe life           cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and           solar systems result from Type I supernova explosions of           SINGLE stars.                          Several chapters are devoted to quasars which, according           to Larson, are densely-packed clusters of stars that have           been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies           and are actually traveling FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT           (although most of that speed is AWAY FROM US IN TIME).                          Astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against           observations that contradict their theories would find           Larson's explanations quite valuable if considered with an           OPEN MIND.  For example, they used to believe that GAMMA RAY           BURSTS originated from pulsars, which exist primarily in the           plane or central bulge of our galaxy.  But the new gamma ray           telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from           ALL DIRECTIONS UNIFORMLY and do NOT correspond with any           visible objects, (except for a few cases of directional           coincidence).  Larson's explanation is that the gamma ray           bursts originate from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTI-MATTER           HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls the "cosmic           sector".  Because the anti-matter universe exists in a           RECIPROCAL RELATION to our material universe, with the speed           of light as the BOUNDARY between them, and has THREE           dimensions of time and ONLY ONE dimension of space, the           bursts can pop into our material universe ANYWHERE seemingly           at random.                          Larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from           books, journal articles, and leading physicists and           astronomers.  In this book, 351 of them are superscripted           with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the           end of the book.  For example, a quote from the book           "Astronomy: The Cosmic Journey", by William K. Hartmann,           says, "Our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if           we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars           form.... Unfortunately we cannot."  Larson's book contains           LOGICAL CONSISTENT EXPLANATIONS of such mysteries that are           WORTHY OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION by ALL physicists,           astronomers, and astrophysicists.                For more information, answers to your questions, etc.,           please consult my CITED SOURCES (Larson's BOOKS).                UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this           IMPORTANT Book Review is ENCOURAGED.                                              Robert E.

Could> someone explain what the Command Loss Timer is?The name is rather descriptive.  It's a command to the spacecraft that tellsit "If you don't hear from Earth after 264 hours, assume something is wrongwith your (the spacecraft) attitude, and go into a preprogrammed search modein an attempt to reacquire the signal from Earth."The spacecraft and Earth are not in constant communication with each other.Earth monitors the telemetry from the spacecraft, and if everything is fine,there's no reason to send it any new information.  But from the spacecraft'spoint of view, no information from Earth could mean either everything isfine, or that the spacecraft has lost signal acquisition.  Just how longshould the spacecraft wait before it decides that something is wrong andbegins to take corrective action?  That "how long" is the command loss timer.During relatively inactive cruise phases, the command loss timer can be setto rather long values.  In this case, Earth is telling Galileo "expect tohear back from us sometime within the next 264 hours".

The project manager is Dr. John Hunter, and he works for theLaser group at Livermore.  What, you may ask, does gas gunshave to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physicallylocated across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,and the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)from which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that theoffice he works for is an administrative convenience.I visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.At the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,but I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),The gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamberabout 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).The chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at severalhundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the pistonis hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tensof atmospheres.The piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it untila stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.The barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inchbore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. theyintersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrelcould be raised and the gun fired into the air without having tomove the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being usedin testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameterand about 50 cm long.All of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogengas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves thebarrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with asheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  Theplastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trappedin the barrel ahead of the projectile.  The gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plasticwater jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plasticprojectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,the projectile vaporizes.The testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range isabout 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 kmif fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gunto Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they canfire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFBto follow the projectiles.The design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4km/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,and the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last testthey blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think ithad to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, butI haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).There are people waiting to test scramjet components in thisgun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.This gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basicallya proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-sized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kguseful payload to orbit.Dani Eder-- Dani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/Rt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.

There should be "classes"such as the following:Large Corp.Small Corp/Company (based on reported earnings?)Large Government (GNP and such)Small Governemtn (or political clout or GNP?)Large Organization (Planetary Society? and such?)Small Organization (Alot of small orgs..)The organization things would probably have to be non-profit or liek ??Of course this means the prize might go up. Larger get more or ??Basically make the prize (total purse) $6 billion, divided amngst the classwinners..More fair?There would have to be a seperate organization set up to monitor the events,umpire and such and watch for safety violations (or maybe not, if peopel wantto risk thier own lives let them do it?).Any other ideas??==Michael Adams, nsmca@acad3.alaska.edu -- I'm not high, just jacked

We grewup in an age of miracles -- Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles,nuclear energy, computers, flights to the moon.  But these weremiracles of our parent's doing.  For a decade and more the punditshave told us - "you've lost it!"  The "me" generation is onlyliving on the accomplishments of the past.     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  Welisten in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Livinghistory they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tellof it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe asGeneral Bernie Schriever told of his team's work - and yes struggle- to build this nation's Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.     What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousanddollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken onlyof that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.Schriever's ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that thebest new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman andPoseidon ballistic missiles.     Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. This event is proof.  To our technological parents: We've listenedto your stories.  We've caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. And we've learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Letme honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetusbehind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatestengineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Yourinsight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporatedinto today's most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.     You told us in the 60's that a new form of launch vehicle - asingle stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  Youadvocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as areall great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  Youconvinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weldits components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of aprime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from thegeneration before you - the generation that built transcontinentalaviation in the 1920's and 30's - build a little and test a littleand Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner whostarted this program for the SDI.     Douglas Aircraft didn't start with a DC-10.  They didn't evenstart with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested alittle - even sold a little and made a little money - before theymoved on to the next step.  They didn't take a decade or morebefore putting the first "rubber on the road."  Max Hunter - youdidn't take ten years to build Thor, and by God we're not going totake ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusableaerospace transportation is real.     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  sameteam here today but a few years to show through the StrategicDefense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -launched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in abouta year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled ourcommitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the SovietUnion.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscoredthe importance of our work in bringing about a new internationalrelationship.     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place theframework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for thenext generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  Thissummer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for thefirst time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next threeyears a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use spacerapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  Andyes - we'll make a little money off it too!     Then - and only then - we'll spend another three years tobuild a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 ofspace will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of therocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. What a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts tocounter SDI merge to power mankind's next step to the stars!     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap tothe final answer.  Robert Goddard's first rockets weren't SaturnV's!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extradollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbitalsystem - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed theway.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocketexhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape theworld again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks athand!     This project is real.  The torch of American technologicalgreatness is being passed.  We are Americans.  This machine isAmerican.  Let's go fly it!

However, a company may discover thatthe cost of launch is not the only cost of advertising, and a company who gauged that ill will would lose them more revenue than the advertising wouldgain might decide to bow out of the project.I got incensed when I read that Carl Sagan called this idea an "abomination."

Hiermee ontstond de tweedeuniversiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerstewaarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkundein de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar devoorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.De huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studentensterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht,vieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scalaaan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren eenplanetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantalvoordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de DiesNatalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Erstaat echter meer op stapel.Studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan eensterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van hetsymposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van hethuidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren.Bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht dedeelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven vande stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In deeerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers eenbeknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren,waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens eenhalf uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindproduktenzullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tothet stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt opeen apart vel.Het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaarsstudenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDENZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM!Tijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goedgaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de RadiosterrenwachtWesterbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussenhet heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal vaneen snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar,in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren.Prof. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snelopvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken entrachten te verklaren.Het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met detechnische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijnnamelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30Watt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zaler niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagsetechnologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.Deelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) enf 16,- (inclusief lunch). Inschrijving geschiedt door hetverschuldigde bedrag over te maken op ABN-AMRO rekening44.46.97.713 t.n.v. stichting 350 JUS. Het gironummer van deABN-AMRO bank Utrecht is 2900.

Twenty-five years ago, the vast majority of astronomers only  had access to optical or radio instruments.

That was certainly partially the case with Apollo, but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military,scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than just a "we have the money, why not?" approach.It's conceivable that Luna will have a military purpose, it's possiblethat Luna will have a commercial purpose, but it's most likely thatLuna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundredyears at least. Therefore, Lunar bases should be predicated on fundinglevels little different from those found for Antarctic bases. Can youput a 200 person base on the Moon for $30 million a year?

Do I have a right to unpolluted air?  No, because the majoritydrive cars and use goods that create air pollution in the manufacturing process.Do I have the right to clean water?  I guess not, by the same reasoning.I could go on with these examples for a long time....Look at Nazi Germany.  Because of the majority, Jews, homosexuals, blacks,and others that were different had no rights.  In fact they were terrorized, imprisoned, and slaughtered.  In this country did blacks have the right to befree from slavery?  I guess not, because the majority said that slavery was good for them.I think that a right has a moral imperative.  If a law, imposed by the majority,is immoral, one should not follow it.  In fact, one should do everything inhis/her power to stop it. Of course, that doesn't mean that I would lose allcommon sense to break the law, just because I thought it was immoral.  I paymy Federal Income Tax even though I am morally opposed to the U.S. Governmenttaking my money and spending it on weapons of mass destruction and terrorism.This is precisely the point I am trying to make.  We should _persude_ people by logic, pointing out that it is in their self-interest to let all haveequal rights in all aspects of life, including adequate housing, food, andmedical care.  I just happen to think that for a full life the aesthetic ofbeauty and joy is also necessary.  That is why I consider an unclutterednight sky a right.Have you ever been out in the desert, away from local lights, and most people?The sky is dark and transparent.  The Milky Way is ablaze with more detailthan you thought possible.  The beauty and wonder takes your breath away.Now imagine you live in the worst ghetto, say in L.A. Due to light pollutionyou have never seen a dark sky.  You might in fact never, not in your wholelife, ever see the majesty of the night sky.

The mental part is usually induced by a lack of clear indication of which way is up or down, ie: the Shuttle is normally oriented with its cargo bay pointed towards Earth, so the Earth (or ground) is "above" the head of the astronauts.

ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD   On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co-inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D.Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell ScienceCenter in Thousand Oaks, CA.   Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in SpaceMaterials Processing with the Space Systems Division of RockwellInternational in Downey, California.  He is a recognized worldauthority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written orcoauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrialmaterials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. DavidCriswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.   Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legalexperts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to buildthe Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with apotential to power the globe.   For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly halffrom California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientificconcept of a solar power system based on the Moon.   The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunarsurface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmittedthrough orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormoussource of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's everincreasing demand using proven, basic technology.

On a tour hosted by JPL Chief Scientist Dr. Moustafa Chahineand Merle McKenzie, manager of the International Affairs Office,Hawking visited a variety of facilities, met with Lab DirectorDr. Edward Stone and various project scientists and managers, andfelt "like royalty," he said. Hawking, whose theories attempt toexplain the origin of distant galaxies, black holes and alternatedimensions, wanted to re-visit JPL, he explained, "because whileI'm most interested in those things in space that are fartheraway, I know that here is where the first steps are taken."     Hawking, who was accompanied by his family, two graduatestudents and his aides, began the tour in von Karman Auditorium,as David Evans, deputy assistant Lab director in the Office ofFlight Projects, and Dr. Arden Albee, Mars Observer's projectscientist, briefed him on current and past flight projects.     Voyager was pointed out to him, with special attention paidto a gold plate with a series of engraved images. Shouldextraterrestrial life stumble upon the spacecraft, Evans noted,they would find a variety of images that would explain somethingof Earth. The professor asked if we were still communicating withthe spacecraft, and Evans affirmed that we are.     Using a model of Mars Observer, Albee spent several minutesdescribing the project and the spacecraft's features. In answerto a question from Hawking, Chahine described a proposeddrag-free satellite, but confirmed that at this point, "it's onlya concept." Chahine, who had met Hawking at Caltech about fiveyears before, described the professor as "a living miracle of thepower of the brain. He's miraculous, and he has such a good senseof humor."     The next stop, a demonstration on scientific datavisualization in Section 384's Digital Image Animation Lab,entertained and delighted the group, as everyone donned gogglesto view 3-D images of Mars. Project Scientist Dr. Eric De Jongshowed off the latest data -- a comet that had only recently beendiscovered in orbit close to Jupiter. Hawking was curious aboutits composition, and as he was shown how images are developed, heasked several questions on their interpretation.     Norman Haynes, ALD, Office of Telecommunications and DataAcquisition, briefed the professor on the Space Flight OperationsFacility, and then Hawking spoke with Stone.     The day ended with two technical discussions of particularinterest to the professor. Technical Group Leader Dr. FrankEstabrook and Senior Research Scientist Hugo Wahlquist describeda three-spacecraft gravity wave experiment, currently under way.Then planetary astronomer Dr. Richard Terrile explained thephilosophy and plans for extra solar system planetary detection.     The Hawking party, which had been visiting SouthernCalifornia for five weeks, was headquartered at Caltech, andplanned to leave for England within a few weeks after the Labtour. Upon departing, the Cambridge-based scientist promisedChahine that he would return to JPL for another visit.                          ###     ___    _____     ___    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

Here's how I understand it. Remember from stellar evolution that black holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars,M(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, takingappoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time,they don't live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so anyof these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB's) will be in the plane of thegalaxy.          Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from thevarious satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, eitherPion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on ourcatalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropicdistribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs ofhomogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we aresampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE.Not cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, Isuppose you are saying, "Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside thedisk."  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less aninterplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay outto beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors detect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here's an analogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane fromthe origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mileaway sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of hisarbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different,and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybefind a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.          I should throw in why halo, and corona models don't work, also.  As Isaid before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (shorttimescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type ofbehavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be boundto the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources.When you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk,but you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely seenot only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources in the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none ofthese characteristics.                  I think that's all of it...if someone needs clarification, or knowssomething that I don't know, by all means correct me.  I had the honor oftaking the Bursts class with the person who has done the modeling of thesedifferent distributions, so we pretty much kicked around every possibledistribution there was, and some VERY outrageous sources. Colliding pulsars,black holes, pulsars that are slowing down...stuff like that.   It's a funfield.

On April 19, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for theExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was receivedproperly.2.  On April 19, a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) testand a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test wereperformed using the LGA-1 (Low Gain Antenna #1) over DSS-63 (Madrid 70 meterantenna) and DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.  Data analysisis in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailedinformation relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.3.  On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.4.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network)advanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone70 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degreesto 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalancemeasurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN (4.5 volts).  The DCmeasurement has ranged from 43 DN (4.6 volts) to 138 DN (16.2 volts) andcurrently reads 138 DN (16.2 volts).  These measurements are consistent withthe model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.6.  The Spacecraft status as of April 22, 1993, is as follows:       a)  System Power Margin -  68 watts       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 21 degrees           off-sun (lagging) and 5 degrees off-earth (leading)       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within           acceptable range       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within           acceptable range       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours           Time To Initiation - 184 hoursTRAJECTORY     As of noon Thursday, April 22, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectorystatus was as follows:Distance from Earth         169,747,800 km (1.14 AU)Distance from Sun           286,967,900 km (1.92 AU)Heliocentric Speed          91,200 km per hourDistance from Jupiter       532,735,900 kmRound Trip Light Time       18 minutes, 58 secondsSPECIAL TOPIC1.

You assumethat the general public "can't handle the truth" and then, based on this assumption, go for the fluff arguments.  Then someone, who can understand agood argument, comes along and asks "why don't you just develop the spinoffs?"or "why can't we just get our spinoffs from some other program, like themilitary?"  There are some good arguments for space development without relyingon its side effects.  I'm not ignoring the value of spinoffs.

The problem is understanding the basicchemical, biological and medical factors to be able to engineer themefficiently.  For example, the only way we know how to produce food is fromplants and animals.  Food synthesis is not very far advanced.  So we haveto orbit a farm.  Well that's obviously not very efficient, so we use technology to reduce the mass and grow plants hydroponically instead of using dirt.  This is where the engineering comes in.  But new technologiesbring new basic questions that we don't have the answers to.  Like, in dirt we can grow tomatoes and lettuce right beside each other, but in hydroponics it turns out that you can't do that.  The lettuce growth is stunted when it's grown in the same hydroponic solution as tomatoes.  So now you have to consider what other plants are going to have similarinteractions.  This means some basic applied scientific research.  And that'swhat needs to be done with all technologies that have been developed so far.We also need to find out how they interact together.  That's where we are now.>So, I would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objective>methods to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologies>which can be applied to long-duration spaceflight. First you need to do the literature search.  There is a lot of informationout there.  Maybe we should just pick a specific area of long term habitation.This could be useful, especially if we make it available on the net.  Thenwe can look at methods of analyzing the technologies.>Such a detailed>literature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocates>and clearly important to existing space programs.>In essence, we would be dividing the space life science issues into>various technical problems which could be solved with various technologies.>This database of acceptable solutions to various problems could form the>basis of detailed discussions involving people from the bionet, isunet,>and any other source!Unless there is an unbelievable outpouring of interest on this on the net,I think we should develop a detailed data base of the literature search first.  Then if we accomplish that we can go on to real analysis.  The database itself could be useful for future engineers.That's my response Ken, what do you think?Tim

Given that Iam not an astrophysicist  or nuclear physicist,  i'll have to boil itdown a bit.1)  ALl the data on bursts to date,  shows a smooth random distribution.2)  that means they aren't concentrated in  galactic cores, our or someoneelses.3) If the distribution is smooth,  we are either seeing some  ENORMOUSLYlarge phenomena  scattered at the edge of the universe  said phenomenabeing subject to debate almost as vioent as the phenomenaORwe are seeing some phenomena  out at like the Oort cloud,  but then it needssome potent little energy source,  that isn't detectable  by any othercurrent methods.4)  we know it's not real close,  like  slightly extra solar,  becausewe have no parallax measurements on the bursts.5)  the bursts seem to bright to be something like black hole quanta orsuper string  impacts or something like that.So everyone is watching the data and arguing like mad in the meanwhile.what i am wondering,  is this in people's opinion,  A NEW Physics problem.Einstein got well known for solvingthe photoelectric effect.   Copernicus,  started looking at  irregularities in planetary motion.Is this a big enough problem, to create a new area of physics?just a little speculative thinking folks.pat

I've transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no meansinfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is granted to copy this without restriction.Michael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at aninformal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois.ACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament andInternational Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because thecompany is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped thathis daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tongato visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king,who happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which the king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million,His Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thoughtthere probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronoussatellite slots.  While this isn't entirely off the wall, it was very unusual,seeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot ofslots.The whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and CarlHilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinionssupporting Tonga's case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from 70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside).According to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in theworld because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and the Pacific Rim. RIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a taxhaven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, tofill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would havecost approximately $2 billion.  It's not easy to raise that kind of money.Eventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in Moscow in such harsh terms that I don't think I'll visit there for a long time.Besides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the waythat people operate.  For example "everybody can sell you everything."  Everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are theonly ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.Eventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a costof $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternbergsays that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos wasout of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  Heagain described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually,he worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the Russian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessionsbefore signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.The next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied Mechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in Siberia (can't figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has builtabout 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented thatsiberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honestpeople who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At thispoint there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion onboth siberians and midwesterners :-)Sternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is apparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite thatwould sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them specifications, they'll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellitesthat RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  Thiscompares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1million compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their satellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They have the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can giveyou their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they aregetting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into placenow.Tidbits:*  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not bigbusiness because big business is just like what they have over there, exceptthat "we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier."*  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launchwithin 9 months.*  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirementfund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia,and a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says issort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.*  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worriedpartly because we aren't used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvaryingmonolith.  Italy gets a new government "every two weeks" but we don't worry because we're used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing whatreally goes on in Russia we won't worry about their stability as much.*  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transferingmoney.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the "equivalent" value in rubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrianbank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so thatthe only the contractors get swindled by the government.*  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western satellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same typeof satellites, which was rather reassuring.*  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitivetechnology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites havea lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites comparewell with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much shorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the difference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition,shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newertechnology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of datehardware.-- Josh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu    "Find a way or make one."             -attributed to Hannibal

For many reasons, it can, and we here on the frontlines see no reason why it should not.  The 'spaceport political publicity'referred to the other day had its intended effect - the state of New Mexicodid establish the start of the necessary government infrastructure to back acommercial space port.  The commanding general at WSMR is in full support ofdual-use for the facilities.  The WSMR location also has some strategicadvantages in the form of necessary infrastructure and controlled air spaceto support the project.  Just because the folks involved have not done thetraditional aerospace-equivalent of vapor-ware by inviting folks out to kicknon-existent tires but have been merely doing their job to prepare forlaunch, don't think that nothing has happened.  From my interactions withthe MACDAC folks, I get the impression that they want to set a firm,believable launch date based on vehicle readiness and not just some fictionto plug a space on a calendar.  I believe that all will happen this summerand don't worry, the locals here are planning to let everyone know when itdoes occur.Stephen Horanshoran@nmsu.edu

These aren't, in a strict sense, amateur rockets. That termdenotes rockets, the engines of which are constructed by the user. Therockets you describe are called HPR, or high power rockets, todistinguish them from (smaller) model rockets. They use factory-madeammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engineswith graphite nozzles. The engines are classified by impulse. A "D"engine, for example, can have no more than 20 newton-seconds of impulse.An "F" engine can have no more than 40 ns. Each letter corresponds to adoubling of the maximum impulse. So far, engines up to size "O" areavailable pretty much off the shelf. Engines of size H and above areshipped as Class B explosives, and as such are controlled. Engines ofsize F and below are shipped as Class C explosives, and are not ascontrolled. Class F engines, BTW, are not HPR engines, but model rocketengines. (Class G engines go in and out of legal limbo.)There is an HPR Society, The Tripoli Rocket Society, I believe, whichholds events at various sites throughout the year, with all legalities(FAA waiver included) taken care of. The National Association ofRocketry is more concerned with engines below H, though it is involvedin HPR as well.

That was my point all along, Fred.>>>>Not only>>>>do you do the same thing on the net (honestly reporting your ideas>>>>on matters of policy and projects in space), but your response was just>>>>baiting, not even part of a debate.>>>I have yet to see Nick enter into anything remotely resembling "a>>>debate".

But debate?  BWAAaaahhhaaaa.>>I'm glad you can laugh, since your ratio of debate/insult is about the same.>Not even close, Tommy, and generally only when I'm dealing with>someone like Nick.I see we are dealing with a problem in a conflict of interpretations, notleast of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what isand is not debate.  Suffice to say that I disagree with you on that lastpoint.  Why don't you take a poll, Fred, if you want some psuedo-objectivepoint-of-view?And, as usual, you defend your insults with "he started it."  "Yeah, Itook some of his research and called it my own, but he started it."  "Sowhat if I stole his car, he stole my lawnmower first."  Besides that, Ithink it's still open to interpretation whether Nick actually did start it.So your defense, besides being lame, and contradicting the first part ofthe sentence in which it occurs, may not even apply anyway.Your defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool:  "Inever borrowed it, I already gave it back, and it was broken when yougave it to me."  Make up yer mind, Fred!>>>>I'm not convinced that people are necessary in all parts of every space->>>>based process, and your response doesn't tell me a thing about the>>>>reasons why you think they should be, except to impune the motives of>>>>the person with a divergent opinion.>>>Who said I think they should be, Tommy?

Then, I point out that I amnot clear what you did mean, rather than risking your childish ire, wronglyinterpreting you a second time, and I'm stupid for it.  I just can't win,can I, Fred?  You've got a great point here somewhere, it's just thatbetween stupid people that you must insult, and your jealous guarding ofyour valuable opinions, you never actually get around to making it.>Please quote the 'it' I took issue with.  I believe you will see (if>you look) that what I was and am taking issue with is Mr Szabo's idea>that the manned program should be scrapped until such time as his>toaster-based infrastructure is finished.  All Hail the Szabo Plan!*** Fred issue #2;  Nick's alleged meaning ***Too bad the plan only exists in your mind, instead of Nick's, or youwould have a really good point.  Instead you have provided a good reasonto ignore your insults, since they are based on incorrect interpretationsthat you have made about others.  Forgive me for giving your insults moremeaning than they ever should have had.My reading of what Nick actually said is that "people aren't required inall parts of all space processes", so your taking issue with his opinionsregarding people in the space program, I read as "People are required inall parts of all space processes."  So, help me out, here, Fred, since I'mso patently stupid.  Did you read Nick wrong?  Or are you going to eatyour terminal now?  If the latter, I sure hope it's one of those Cheeto andstring models that all the computer mags have been raving about :-)The point is, _I_ am not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption.  I'donly be stupid if I insulted you for having made it.  But, alas, that's yourjob, Fred.And, finally, your style is confusing, since you tried to make two points,simultaneously, with an allegory/insult.  Sadly, one point addressed a 'plan'that only existed in your mind, and the other took issue with behaviors thatyou do as much as anyone.>More deliberate lack of understanding, Tommy?No, no, I finally got it.  You don't like the plan that Nick's posts madeyou imagine.  And you don't like Nick's obnoxious behavior, even thoughit's no worse than your own.  Thanks for taking the time with someone asdense as myself.>>>>If you have a problem with Nick's delivery, address that.  The way you>>>>bait, you're perpetuating the lack of discourse that you complain of.>>>No, Tommy, the 'bait' is that which elicits the response.  *NICK*>>>'baits'; I just flame him for being an obnoxious fool.>>I don't really care who started it.

Or is this just the pique of a>net.ghod wannabe who got turned down by someone he *thought* was new>(and hence could be 'instructed' -- Tommy, I saw you come on the net).Who cares who came on the net first?  If you do, consider that you sawme come on after a brief haitus, before which I was on for about 2 years.If you had seen me on the net first, you'd remember when Nick and I wentdown exactly the same road regarding rude, unneccesary behavior.  It'sjust amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that'sno worse than your own.Let's see here, my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical,while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn't, and mycomplaints about your name-calling are immature, while your name-callingisn't.  Yeah, right.  Maybe if you called me some more names, I mightsee it better, Fred."Net.ghod wannabe"?  Naturally, Fred, you've correctly interpreted mymotivations, when yours are impossible to judge from your actions (asyour insulting of people that try, proves).  I didn't really care aboutpeople that fill the net with personal garbage, what I really wanted was toimpress everyone.  I only put my complaints with your behavior on privatemail, not because it belongs there, but because I thought you were such ajerk that you'd bring it back to the Net, playing right into my hands.Alas, I had no idea what an intellectual master you were, turning tables andbringing the history of these posts to the net, for the noble and valuablepurpose of embarassing me.  Whether I should feel stupid because I triedto make suggestions to such a superior intellect, or becuase I tried tocommunicate like an adult with a self-righteous ass, still isn't clear.Well, Fred, you exposed me.  Now I'll never be able to get a(nother) jobwith NASA, since they all know that I'm stupider than Fred McCall.  Well,I just hope you're happy.  Please leave me alone, now.  I just don'thave the heart to attempt keeping up with one so far above me.

This scaling is      cited for lunar craters and may hold true for      other bodies.(1/3.4)    S = (p / p )    : correction factor for target density p  ,     p  a   t    t      p  = 1.8 g/cm^3 for alluvium at the Jangle U       a      crater site, p = 2.6 g/cm^3 for average      rock on the continental shields.    C    : crater collapse factor, 1 for craters <= 3 km      in diameter, 1.3 for larger craters (on Earth).    (1/3.4)    K    : .074 km / (kT TNT equivalent)     n      empirically determined from the Jangle U      nuclear test crater.      3   2       19    W = pi * d* delta * V  / (12 * 4.185 * 10  )    : projectile kinetic energy in kT TNT equivalent      given diameter d, velocity v, and projectile      density delta in CGS units. delta of around 3      g/cm^3 is fairly good for an asteroid.    An RMS velocity of V = 20 km/sec may be used for Earth-crossing    asteroids.    Under these assumptions, the body which created the Barringer Meteor    Crater in Arizona (1.13 km diameter) would have been about 40 meters in    diameter.    More generally, one can use (after Gehrels, 1985):    Asteroid    Number of objects  Impact probability  Impact energy    diameter (km)       (impacts/year)   (* 5*10^20 ergs)     10    10     10^-810^9      1 1 000     10^-610^6      0.1       100 000     10^-410^3    assuming simple scaling laws. Note that 5*10^20 ergs = 13 000 tons TNT    equivalent, or the energy released by the Hiroshima A-bomb.    References:    Gehrels, T. 1985 Asteroids and comets. _Physics Today_ 38, 32-41.

The latter was written with    simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind    (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).    More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John    Snyder's USGS publication "Map Projections--A Working Manual", USGS    Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32    projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both    spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It's a    neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one's $20.    You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,    "An Album of Map Projections", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This    contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are    in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.    You can order these 2 ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from USGS:    Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey, 507 National    Center, Reston, VA 22092. (800)-USA-MAPS. They can quote you a price and    tell you where to send your money. Expect a 6-8 week turnaround time.    A much faster way (about 1 week) is through Timely Discount Topos,    (303)-469-5022, 9769 W. 119th Drive, Suite 9, Broomfield, CO 80021. Call    them and tell them what you want. They'll quote a price, you send a    check, and then they go to USGS Customer Service Counter and pick it up    for you. Add about a $3-4 service charge, plus shipping.    A (perhaps more accessible) mapping article is:R. Miller and F. Reddy, "Mapping the World in Pascal",Byte V12 #14, December 1987Contains Turbo Pascal procedures for five common map projections. Ademo program, CARTOG.PAS, and a small (6,000 point) coastline datais available on CompuServe, GEnie, and many BBSs.    Some references for spherical trignometry are:_Spherical Astronomy_, W.M.

Convert parallax into distance using the    formula in part 6 of the FAQ, convert RA and declination to coordinates    on a unit sphere (see some of the references on planetary positions and    spherical trignometry earlier in this section for details on this), and    scale this by the distance.    Two databases useful for this purpose are the Yale Bright Star catalog    (sources listed in FAQ section 3) or "The Catalogue of Stars within 25    parsecs of the Sun" (in pub/SPACE/FAQ/stars.data and stars.doc on    ames.arc.nasa.gov).NEXT: FAQ #5/15 - References on specific areas

Indications were that the spacecraft had entered aFault Protection mode sometime between that time and receipt of normaltelemetry at the end of the previous station pass (DSS-15 - Goldstone 34meter antenna) at approximately 8:00 PM the evening before.  Entry intoContingency Mode was verified when signal was reacquired and telemetryindicated that the spacecraft was sun coning.  After subsystem engineersreported all systems performing nominally, fault protection telemetry modeswere reconfigured and memory readouts of command system Audit Queue andAACS (Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem) Starex performed.  Thesereadouts verified that Contingency Mode entry occurred shortly after 1:30 AMyesterday, 4/29/93.  Preliminary indications are that a Sun Ephemeris Checkfailure triggered fault protection.  However, the Flight Team will bedetermining the precise cause over the next few days.As of last evening, the spacecraft had been commanded back to InertialReference and was stable in that mode.  The Flight Team is planning tocommand the spacecraft back to Array Normal Spin state today.Magnetometer Calibration activities had completed prior to ContingencyMode entry.  MAG Calibration data has been recorded on Digital TapeRecorders 2 and 3.  Playback of DTRs 2 and 3, scheduled to be completedyesterday, was postponed when Contingency Mode entry halted FlightSequence C9 execution.  The Flight Team is developing a strategy to restartC9 to complete data playback.  Present planning is to perform playbacksbetween  as soon as Wednesday, or as late as Friday of next week (5/5-5/7), dependent on Contingency Mode recovery activity.  DTR playback willbe performed via the High Gain Antenna at 42,667 bits per second.  Uponverification of successful DTR playbacks, downlink will be maintained atthe 4K S & E rate.     ___    _____     ___    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger   economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a   lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,   but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing   military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than   just a "we have the money, why not?" approach.Ah, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is notwasted on the moon. It's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000R?) billsto fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would bespent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of fundinghigh-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund variousfields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to thedefense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC tofund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-Europeancooperation.Now maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste ofmoney (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count asinvestment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look atthe size of that multiplier :->).Nick Haines nickh@cmu.edu

Some of what I would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief in an afterlife.  The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels (or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains one weekend, "getting away from it all" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 miles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters much either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't fouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever - like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  If ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a lastbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at 8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved. Regards, Wm. Hathaway Baltimore MD

Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, andcommercial space.  This is how it went...After receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,I called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) PattyMurray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heardthe gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour.Later in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.We got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,who scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were notbozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.Well, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talkingto him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.We covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  Most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was anotherwoman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic thatwe brought up.But, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporatealigned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.So, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access toLEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming feasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.We hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourismpaper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees theatmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smogover L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is more pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to understanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education whereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out thatthey havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to otherfields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.We hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle businessangle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personalcommunicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs providedin those sectors.Jobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..We mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.We left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in orderto make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.We ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts areproceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that theresults from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),and most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts alongthe lines of lowering the cost to LEO.In the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data Purchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it.He asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,and contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actuallyhappen immediatly there.The last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that weknew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that theycould feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't knowthe answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people whoreally did know the answers.Then finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  Hesaid that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, thiswould be something that she would be very interested in, although theydo have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in thestate 1 week out of 6 these days.All in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.John.

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS    Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints    have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on    microfilm.    The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it    is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like    guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB    have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch    from.    By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify    the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean    sheet design.    WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE    Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access    for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an    opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being    "scooped" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently    releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early    in a mission.    RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES    There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to    block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium    thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in    worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental    reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.    Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2    RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather    satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months    with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar    module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which    was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in    the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are    expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10    half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].    To make your own informed judgement, some references you may wish to    pursue are:    A good review of the technical facts and issues is given by Daniel    Salisbury in "Radiation Risk and Planetary Exploration-- The RTG    Controversy," *Planetary Report*, May-June 1987, pages 3-7.

IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER    From time to time, claims are made that chemicals released from    the Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are responsible    for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies    indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in    absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The    remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted    study, Charles Jackman.    The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the    stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was    organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space    Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia    (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space    Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and    Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects    of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.    The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:       Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year  Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year  Shuttle sources:  725,000 kilograms/year    The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are    launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the    total stratospheric chlorine sources.    The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would    be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability    associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.    The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed    by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally    averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and    Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch    schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be    increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about    the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons    do at the present time.    Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space    Shuttle's Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR    Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W. Ko and N.D. Sze, Journal of Geophysical    Research, 95, 18583-18590, 1990.

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE    If you *don't* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a    minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your    breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to    watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your    Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal    experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no    immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do    not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.    Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly "the bends", certainly some    [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)    start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from    lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,    you're dying. The limits are not really known.

Koestler ed., NASA CR-329 (Nov 1965).    _Experimental Animal Decompression to a Near Vacuum Environment_, R.W.    Bancroft, J.E. Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 (June 1965), USAF School    of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Texas.    HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED    The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is    a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.    What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank    came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the    astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin    team's medical/forensic report.    The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the    water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks    underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team    examined them, they were sent off to be buried.    USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT    You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit    because it can't get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry    enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.    Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of    that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in    the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly    specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit. Taking it    higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would    be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit    spacecraft.    [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]    THE "FACE ON MARS"    There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid    face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:    35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often    published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13    (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).    Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is    artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an    extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the    resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a    smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere    on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't    know the address) to study the Face.    The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution    camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this    question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is    best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or    sci.astro.    V. DiPeitro and G.

Boeing has been looking at several TSTO vehicles and has carriedout extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for sometime.  A good reference on this might be: "Comparison of PropulsionOptions for Advanced Earth-To-Orbit (ETO) Applications (IAF-92-0639)." by V.A. Weldon and L.E. Fink from Boeing.   The paperdescribes a propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieveaircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problemsassociated with liquid hydrogen fuel.  Basically, it's a high-speedairplane launching a Hermes-type spaceplane   The design (the concept is also called "Beta") as laid out in thepaper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, or 20,000pounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons andlife support.  System design reliability is .9995.   Beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjetsand 12 high- speed civil transport (HSCT) turbofans.  A 108-foot-long reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first-stage aircraft, which also could accommodate a longer and heavypayload on an expendable second stage.   To launch the orbital vehicle, the first stage takes off like anormal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3.  At that point the turbofans,modified to burn catalyzed JP-7, would shut off and the ramjets,would take over.  At Mach 5.5 the orbiter or the ELV would swingout, ignite and proceed to orbit. Both vehicles would land likeaircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions.   Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoffis about 1.5 M lbs, roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An-225.The orbiter stages weighs about 400,Klbs including 335 Klbsof LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrustrocket engines. Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin,with the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by-25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. LOX wouldbe stored aft.  Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design'ssuccess is the structurally efficient airframe and the compacttankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel.     The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design.  They concludewhile a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost, a TSTO is easier,cheaper, and less risky to develop, simpler to build, has greatersafety and mission versatility and doesn't carry the hard-to-handleand bulky hydrogen fuel. The conlcude "In conjunction with its majoruse of airplane type engines and fuel, as well as its inherent self-ferry capability, it is probably the system most likely to provideas close to airline-like operations as possible with a practicalconfiguration, until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept canbe shown to be operationally viable."  >Is this really news? Does this threaten further work on DC-?   Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs forsome time.  I expect this, or a similar concept (perhaps the HTHLSSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase) is being re-examined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter.   Does it threaten DC-???.  Possibly -- There is a set of on-goingstudies trying straighten out the government's future spacetransportation strategy.  MDC and Boeing (as well as other firms)are providing data to a joint study team back in DC.  There arevarious factions and options vying for attention -- includingshuttle upgrades, shuttle replacement (what was called the "4-2-3"architecture), SpaceLifter, ELV upgrades, and various advancedvehicles (ALES, Beta, DC-??, NASP, FSTS, SSTOs of several types,etc.)  NASA/DOD/DOT are trying to put together a coherent strategyfor future US gov't space transportation systems, and trying tojuggle near-term launch needs (like for DoD and NASA) againstmedium-term needs (including commercial considerations), and againstthe investment and risk of going to "leap frog" new technologieslike SDIO/SSTO and NASP and Beta.   It's a heck of a problem.  The worst part of the problem isn'tthat there aren't promising ideas and concepts -- there are dozensof them -- but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs inthe near term.  They should have a draft report in mid-June, with afinal report coming by the end of the fiscal year. ------------------------------------------------------------------ Wales Larrison                           Space Technology Investor  --- Maximus 2.01wb

Others claim to be staying of their own freewill, but Jobs' persuasive manner makes this hard to confirm.In conversations with authorities, Jobs has given conflictinginformation on how heavily prepared the group is for war with theindustry.  At times, he has claimed to "have hardware which will blowanything else away", while more recently he claims they have stoppedmanufacturing their own.Agents from the ATF (Apple-Taligent Forces) believe that the group isequipped with serious hardware, including 486-caliber pieces andpossibly Canon equipment.The siege has attracted a variety of spectators, from the curious toother cultists.  Some have offered to intercede in negotiations,including a young man who will identify himself only as "Bill" andclaims to be the "MS-iah".Former members of the cult, some only recently deprogrammed, speakhesitantly of their former lives, including being forced to work20-hour days, and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies.  There werefrequent lectures in which they were indoctrinated into a theory of"interpersonal computing" which rejects traditional roles.Late-night vigils on Chesapeake Drive are taking their toll onfederal marshals.  Loud rock and roll, mostly Talking Heads, blaresthroughout the night.  Some fear that Jobs will fulfill his ownapocalyptic prophecies, a worry reinforced when the loudspeakerscarry Jobs' own speeches -- typically beginning with a chilling "Iwant to welcome you to the 'Next World' ".- - -- Roland J.

(This last pointis always worth hitting upper management with "gently" if you want them to think and as hard as you can if you have a good case thatthere really is competion)

But they have been systematically           IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years!                The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's comprehensive           GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he           calls the "Reciprocal System", is built on two fundamental           postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of           space and time:                    (1) "The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE           component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE           UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME."                    (2) "The physical universe conforms to the relations of           ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are           ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN."                    From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE           Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of           translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward           SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light           (which Larson called "UNIT VELOCITY" and "THE NATURAL           DATUM").                      At each step in the development, Larson was able to           MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the           REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles           [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star           clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white           dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET           DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY           BURSTS).                          And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom,           Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility           and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of           matter.                All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy           complex mathematics, in his books.               BOOKS of Dewey B. Larson                         The following is a complete list of the late Physicist           Dewey B. Larson's books about his comprehensive GENERAL           UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe.  Some of the early           books are out of print now, but still available through           inter-library loan.                    "The Structure of the Physical Universe" (1959)                    "The Case AGAINST the Nuclear Atom" (1963)                   "Beyond Newton" (1964)                    "New Light on Space and Time" (1965)                    "Quasars and Pulsars" (1971)                    "NOTHING BUT MOTION" (1979)                     [A $9.50 SUBSTITUTE for the $8.3 BILLION "Super                                                             Collider".]                     [The last four chapters EXPLAIN chemical bonding.]               "The Neglected Facts of Science" (1982)                     "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION" (1984)                    [FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL astrophysical                                                            mysteries.]                      "BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER" (1988)               All but the last of these books were published by North           Pacific Publishers, P.O. Box 13255, Portland, OR  97213, and           should be available via inter-library loan if your local           university or public library doesn't have each of them.                Several of them, INCLUDING the last one, are available           from: The International Society of Unified Science (ISUS),           1680 E. Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the           organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.            They have other related publications, including the quarterly           journal "RECIPROCITY".                     Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background                   Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer           (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he           died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in           Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He           developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the           physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE           chemical properties based only on the elements used.                    Larson's lack of a fancy "PH.D." degree might be one           reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is           NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider           to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same           time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX           physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer,           well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC           ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC..                     Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally           test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.            He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER           researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in           many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER.                    A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX           physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking           for a "unified field theory" that works, but have been           IGNORING one for over 30 years now!                    "Modern physics" does NOT explain the physical universe           so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of           quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who           agree.  And remember that "epicycles", "crystal spheres",           "geocentricity", "flat earth theory", etc., ALSO once SEEMED           to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG.                        Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior,           was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or           still is) President of Larson's organization, "THE           INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE", and Editor of           their quarterly Journal "RECIPROCITY".  He moved to           Minneapolis after retiring.               "Super Collider" BOONDOGGLE!                         I am AGAINST contruction of the "Superconducting Super           Collider", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS           WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of "scientific"           value.                    Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the           comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist           Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY           particles ("mesons", "hyperons", ALLEGED "quarks", etc.)           which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab,           Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are           CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly           disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible           with their environment.                    A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a           few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not           seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE           CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW!                    Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3           BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for           this WASTED money?!                         Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed           location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some           kind of "fire ants" eating the insulation off underground           cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water           with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of           the "Supercollider"?!                              Naming the "Super Collider" after Ronald Reagon, as           proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be           named after a leading particle PHYSICIST.                 LARSONIAN Anti-Matter                         In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the           physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of           opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more           to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the           photons of which they are made, in relation to the           vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light,           which Larson calls "Unit Velocity" and the "Natural Datum".                     In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of           MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet,           the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their           respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each           other.                      In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical           universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension           of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our           MATERIAL half.                  LARSONIAN Relativity                         The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury           has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the           rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this           advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational           perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter,           etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to           help "prove" Einstein's "General Theory of Relativity".                    But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results           CLOSER to the 43 seconds than "General Relativity" can, by           INSTEAD using "SPECIAL Relativity".  In one or more of his           books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH           ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury.                    Larson TOTALLY REJECTED "General Relativity" as another           MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of "Special           Relativity", including the parts about "mass increases" near           the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on           doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than           1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT,           although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.).                     In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the           physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead           of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured           from our material half of the physical universe.  The one           dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low           relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are           NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and           the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR.           [Larson often used the term "COORDINATE TIME" when writing           about this.]                         In regard to "mass increases", it has been PROVEN in           atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near           the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is           ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists           are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory,           mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is           actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS           BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.            The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward           SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of           the so-called "Big Bang" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL           FANTASY).                                                             THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book "THE UNIVERSE           OF MOTION", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific           Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456           pages, indexed, hardcover.                    It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL           UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that           author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago.                    It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical           mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and           multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of           the "3-degree" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white           dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc..                    It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL           looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with           OPEN MINDS!                    The following is an example of his Theory's success:           In his first book in 1959, "THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL           UNIVERSE", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING           GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding           them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's           comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he           had an immediate related explanation for them also.                GAMMA-RAY BURSTS               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching           their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were           originally thought to originate from "neutron stars" in the           disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in           Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions           uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT           correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of           directional coincidence).                    Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the           GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by           the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of           his book "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION", published in 1984, the           gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the           ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls           the "Cosmic Sector".  Because of the relationship between the           anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and           the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can           pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at           random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do           not correspond with known objects, and come from all           directions uniformly.)                    I wonder how close to us in space a source location           would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most           life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to           stop it!                    Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which           are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were           actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS!               LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation                         About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the           vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox           astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory           theory about how they form or why there are so many of them.                    But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY           CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of           the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey           B. Larson.                    I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is           detailed in Chapter 7 of his book "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"           and in some of his other books.                    First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate           energy by "fusion".  A small fraction comes from slow           gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE           ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each           element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the           element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal           temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and           absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually           reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and           lighter elements.                    When the internal temperature of the star reaches the           destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I           SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron           present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms           and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some           of his books [better than I can].                    When the star explodes, the lighter material on the           outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less           than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center           portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to           the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The           explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and           it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN           SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while.                    Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall           back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown           outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The           material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a           WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward           the "MAIN SEQUENCE" from opposite directions on the H-R           Diagram.                    The chances of the two masses falling back into the           exact same location in space, making a single lone star           again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY           system, orbiting each other.                     According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE           DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the           material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown           outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to           MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about "degenerate matter", "neutron           stars", "black holes", etc..               LARSONIAN Solar System Formation               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the           exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single           white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL "mini" white dwarf           stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably           still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected           by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS!                      In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all           this information, and other principles of his comprehensive           GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive           his own version of Bode's Law.                     "Black Hole" FANTASY!               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently           completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO "black           holes" merging together into a SINGLE "black hole", and           concluded that the new "black hole" would have MORE MASS than           the sum of the two original "black holes".                    Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED           FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of "black           holes", etc.!                    After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about           his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical           universe, especially his book "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION", it is           clear to me that "black holes" are NOTHING more than           MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is           just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the "black           hole" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want           to "prove" their theory.                        By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is           being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and           astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical           problem somehow makes him "wiser".  It does NOT!                    I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist           Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread           publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's           Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of           Unified Science).                                         ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection           with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to           find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed.                    I found a possible clue about why they might work on           pages 112-113 of the book "BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER", by           the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of           Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical           universe.  I quote one paragraph:                    "As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development           of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally           different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.            The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It           was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book "NOTHING BUT           MOTION"] that there are physical processes in operation which           produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that,           although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in           many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities           for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are           limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of           free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the           universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged           state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension           space, because they are inherently rotating units of space,           and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open           space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently           in the same location with respect to the natural reference           system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the           stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron,           like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by           the progression of the natural reference system.  All           material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons           similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.            Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later,           whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The           electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth           therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level."                          Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are           also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a           particular frequency (above the "unit" frequency) spinning           around one axis at a particular rate (below the "unit" rate).            ("Unit velocity" is the speed of light, and there are           vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light,           according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the "above" and           "below" labels mixed up.]                    Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of           light!                    If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION           fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these           electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a           charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to           achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge           is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular           frequency (above the "unit" frequency) superimposed on the           rotation of the particle.)                      The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to           confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is           generated in clouds.           SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical           universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has           been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in           his first book "THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE".                    It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan,           and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call           "science" (or "physics", or "astronomy", etc.), as well as           the "scientific" literature and the "education" systems, to           TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have.                    Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many           things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such           as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars.                    Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY           discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals,           in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles           of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses           at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and           elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a           worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed.                              For more information, answers to your questions, etc.,           please consult my CITED SOURCES (especially Larson's BOOKS).                UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this           IMPORTANT partial summary is ENCOURAGED.                                        Robert E.

Hmm... there must be two towns with the same name.  Kaliningrad,located just North of Moscow is correct.  It is the home of severalRussian space enterprises, including NPO Energia, Krunichev, Fakel,and Tsniimach.  The main Russian manned spacecraft control facilityis also located here.   Kaliningrad is easily reachable by auto from Moscow, and tourscan be arranged.  Call ahead though, there are still armed militaryguards at many of these facilities -- who don't speak English,aren't well paid, and are rather bored.

The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or inhassles.The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting tothe Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practicallydown in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses anynew problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km --the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course,you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyunsand beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (formore than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit.For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can developa new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clippermight be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are lessambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doingsustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wastingmoney in a big way.Given this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* aminor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, whichdominates the cost of the project.-- All work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology                    - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry

The observations were executed as       scheduled, and no problems were reported.     o Observations were made using the High Speed Photometer of the Planet       Uranus during an occultation by a faint star in Capricornus. These       observations will help in our understanding of the planet's       atmospheric radiative and dynamical processes. This event occurred       close to the last quarter moon, and special arrangements had to be       made to modify the lunar limit tests to allow these observations.

A few sites offer direct dialup access or remote login access, while the    remainder support some form of file transfer. Many sites are listed as    providing 'anonymous FTP'. This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on    the Internet. Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP    directly, but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via    email. Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com    or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and the servers will send you instructions    on how to make requests.    The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames    SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center.    Don't even ask for images to be posted to the net. The data volume is    huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it.VIEWING IMAGES    The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly    large, and I won't attempt to cover common formats (GIF, etc.) here. To    read PDS and VICAR (and many other) formats on Unix systems running X,    use XV 2.11, available by anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu    (18.24.0.12) in contrib/xv-2.11.tar.Z and the other standard X11 FTP    sites.    The FAQ for the Usenet group alt.binaries.pictures discusses image    formats and how to get image viewing software. A copy of this document    is available by anonymous FTP from the Usenet FAQ archives at    pit-manager.mit.edu (18.72.1.58), in directory    pub/usenet/alt.binaries.pictures.ONLINE ARCHIVES    NASA AMES    Extensive archives are maintained at NASA Ames and are available via    anonymous FTP or an email server. These archives include many images and    a wide variety of documents including this FAQ list, NASA press    releases, shuttle launch advisories, and mission status reports. Please    note that these are NOT maintained on an official basis.    FTP users should connect to ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) and look in    pub/SPACE. pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the    archive (the index is about 200K by itself).    To access the archives by email, send a letter to    archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the    subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:send SPACE Indexsend SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91.    The capitalization of the subdirectory names is important. All are in    caps. Only text files are handled by the email server at present; use    one of the FTP email servers described in the introduction to this    section for images or programs.    The Magellan Venus and Voyager Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus CD-ROM image    disks have been put online in the CDROM and CDROM2 directories. The    disks will be rotated on a weekly basis. Thousands of images are    available in these collections.    The GIF directory contains images in GIF format. The VICAR directory    contains Magellan images in VICAR format (these are also available in    the GIF directory). A PC program capable of displaying these files is    found in the IMDISP directory (see the item "VIEWING IMAGES" below).    The NASA media guide describes the various NASA centers and how to    contact their public affairs officers; this may be useful when pursuing    specific information. It's in MISC/media.guide.    Any problems with the archive server should be reported to Peter Yee    (yee@ames.arc.nasa.gov).    NASA ASTROPHYSICS DATA SYSTEM    The ADS is a distributed data retrieval system which is easy to use and    provides uniform access to ground-based and space-based astronomy data    from NASA data centers across the country. It currently has over 140    data catalogs of radio, infrared, optical, UV, and X-ray data which can    be queried by position or any other parameter in the catalog. The ADS    also provides tools to manipulate and plot tabular results. In addition,    ADS has a Beta version of an Abstracts Service which allows users to    query over 125,000 abstracts of astronomy papers since 1975 by authors,    keywords, title words, or abstract text words.    ADS use requires direct Internet access. For more info and to sign up to    become a user, email ads@cuads.coloradu.edu. The User's Guide and    "QuickStart" Guide are available by anonymous FTP to sao-ftp.harvard.edu    in directory pub/ads/ADS_User_Guide (PostScript files).

NASA SPACELINK    SpaceLink is an online service located at Marshall Space Flight Center    in Huntsville, Alabama. The system is specifically designed for    teachers. The data base is arranged to provide easy access to current    and historical information on NASA aeronautics, space research, and    technology transfer information. Also included are suggested classroom    activities that incorporate information on NASA projects to teach a    number of scientific principles. Unlike bulletin board systems, NASA    Spacelink does not provide for interaction between callers. However it    does allow teachers and other callers to leave questions and comments    for NASA which may be answered by regular mail. Messages are answered    electronically, even to acknowledge requests which will be fulfilled by    mail. Messages are generally handled the next working day except during    missions when turnaround times increase. The mail system is closed-loop    between the user and NASA.    SpaceLink also offers downloadable shareware and public domain programs    useful for science educators as well as space graphics and GIF images    from NASA's planetary probes and the Hubble Telescope.    You can dial in at (205)-895-0028 (300/1200/2400/9600(V.32) baud, 8    bits, no parity, 1 stop bit), or telnet to spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov    (128.158.13.250, also known as xsl.msfc.nasa.gov) if you're on the    Internet. Anonymous FTP capability (password guest) is now available.    Most of this information is also available from the Ames server in    directory SPACELINK.    NATIONAL SPACE SCIENCE DATA CENTER (NSSDC)    The National Space Science Data Center is the official clearinghouse for    NASA data. The data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online.    Internet users can telnet to nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov (128.183.36.23) and    log in as 'NODIS' (no password). You can also get the catalog by sending    email to 'request@nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov'.

By the time they could make the Earth's sky look like Las Vegas, the people could afford to go backpacking on the Moon.

Matthew    Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on    Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material    posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).US PLANETARY MISSIONS    MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)    MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed    minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground    stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the    onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in    the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the    Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed    to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a    transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted    from the expression "R-dot-bar sub n" (nth smoothed value of derivative    of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations    of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.    MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December    of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a    very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world    with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide    (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).    MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary    space. Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar    panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in    solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.    MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and    took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it    flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere    much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from    this preliminary scan that Mars was a "dead" world in both the    geological and biological sense.    MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that    planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information    that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times    that of Earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface    of an ocean.    MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work    done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away    the concept of Mars as a "dead" planet, first made from the basic    measurements of MARINER 4.    MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket    launcher autopilot failed.    MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to    orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no    other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian    surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once    flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup    images of Mars' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.    MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe    did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in    ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,    plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four    Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974    to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed    Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than    thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which    makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.    PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)    PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph    the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide    new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new    data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft    had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on    October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.    PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first    U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally    designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead    studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to    36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6    through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,    and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would    have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.    PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER    11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to    study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through    1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever    to do so.    PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER    12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made    the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus    2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere    in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the    atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the    surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day    probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before    its batteries failed.    RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)    RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They    were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems    left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.    RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an    instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the    launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.    RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the    camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.    RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but    suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,    the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.    RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost    all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon    and drifted off into solar orbit.    RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send    back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact    with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras    did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first    U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.    LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)    LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image    various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO    missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our    understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.    All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were    essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.    probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar    surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.    SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)    The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar    module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the    soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered    in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing    vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was    strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.    Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the    first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images    and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from    SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,    the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored    the Tycho crater region in 1968.    VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)    VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on    a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June    19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse    Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for    Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes    found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of    its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was    pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is    pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the    thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and    boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.    The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran    out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a    weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep    functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command    had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until    further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the    engineers' efforts through May of 1983.    An interesting side note: VIKING 1's lander has been designated the    Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the    lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,    D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until    it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.    VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit    on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in    Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its    sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording    one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in    1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut    down on April 12, 1980.    The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.    VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)    VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March    5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched    August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,    1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and    by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare    once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to    outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,    but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.    Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their    satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered    that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and    aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major    surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous    volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.    When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets    and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep    the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive    jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle    is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas' appearance was    startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.    The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,    kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.    VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,    continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly    monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was    found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational    axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on    Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10    satellites and one more ring were discovered.    In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,    including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright    patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were    discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a    canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)    The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their    on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets    beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the    location of the heliopause.SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS    Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and    Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:    SOVIET LUNAR PROBES    LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first     craft in solar orbit.    LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.    LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.    ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was     also a test for future Mars missions.    LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images     from surface.    LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.    LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.    ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8     accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were     unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.    LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil      to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in      1972.    LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon's      surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished      with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.    LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in      1976.    SOVIET VENUS PROBES    VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions       lost enroute in 1961.    VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with       VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in       February of 1966. No images were returned.    VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.       Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe       became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.    VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending       through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before       reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles       similar in 1969.    VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet       in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in       1972.    VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the       first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar       mission.    VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982.VENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.    VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections ofplanet's surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.    VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian     atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on     to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in     March of 1986.    SOVIET MARS PROBES    MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased     enroute the following year.    ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian     surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.    MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red     Planet in 1971.    MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.    MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.    MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.     probe MARINER 9.    MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.    MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit     with its flyby bus.    PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars' largest       moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to       human/computer error.    PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week       before scheduled Phobos landing.    While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even    interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have    yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,    Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a    Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been    planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now    the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their    space program remains to be seen.JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS    SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on    January 8 1985, and approached Halley's Comet within about 7 million km    on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to    measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of    which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on    January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth's. The closest    approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The    geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for    a Japanese spacecraft.    During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail    passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby    will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth's radius)), and the third    October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).    HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,    1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten    once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first    lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget    satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to    orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.    The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An    apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists    to lose track of it. Hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on March    19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. The    rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt    camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.    Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and    performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth's atmosphere. Hiten    made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,    1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and    fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into    lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the    approach:Apoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 kmPeriapsis Altitude: about 9,600 kmInclination: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)Period: 4.7 daysPLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES    I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three    groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,    and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means    complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your    research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can    add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.    Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it    would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in    order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in    this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date    general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra    background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good    public and university library. Some of the more recently published works    can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market    bookstore.    General Overviews (in alphabetical order by author):      J.

Other works and periodicals:    NASA has published very detailed and technical books on every space    probe mission it has launched. Good university libraries will carry    these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission    you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study    some of the books listed above.    Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL    GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's    Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,    SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER    missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the    VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.    More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions    can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and    SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major    newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,    but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events    were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are    affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you    probably know.    Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you    might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space    groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their    periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe    missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,    Pasadena, California 91106 USA.    Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I    personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas    in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from    it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.

WHen aparticularly bright burst occurs, There are a couple of other detectors thatcatch it going off.  Pioneer 10 or 11 is the one I'm getting at here.  Thispuppy is far enough away, that if a bright burst happens nearby, the hugeannulus created by it will hopefully intersect the line or general circle givenby BATSE, and we can get a moderately accurate position. Say oh, 2 or 3degrees. That is the closest anyone has ever gotten with it.          Actually, my advisor, another classmate of mine, and me were talkingthe other day about putting just one detector on one of the Pluto satellites. THen we realized that the satellite alone is only carrying something like 200pounds of eq.  Well, a BATSE detector needs lead shielding to protect it, and 1alone weighs about 200 pounds itself.        We decided against it.                                                        -jeremy

TheCommand Loss Timer is simply looking for a command, any command.  A"no-op" is simply a spacecraft command that drops bits into the bigbit bucket in the sky.

(It was a few months before _The Abyss_ came out.)As far as I can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficultto do at once with a substitute breathing fluid:  - low viscosity --- if it's too difficult to force the fluid in & out     of the lungs, you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own    breathing effort (let alone anything else)  - diffusion rate --- obviously, not all the air in your lungs is    expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn't expelled    is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?)    So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done    by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen    tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough    oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.  - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough    gas per unit volume.   Oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungsor interfere with their healing or anything like that... --Wim Lewis, wiml@u.washington.edu

They (SDIO) have been looking for more funds and do seem to havesome. However, SDIO is not (I repeat, is not) going to fund an orbitalprototype. The best we can hope from them is to 1) keep it alive foranother year, and 2) fund a suborbital vehicle which MIGHT (withmajor modifications) just make orbit. There is also some money for aset of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions.Better news comes from the new Spacelifter effort. The USAF managers ofthis program are very open to SSTO and will have about $50M nextyear for studies. This would be enough to bring DC-Y to PDR.Now not all of this money will go to DC but a good case could be madefor spending half on DC.Public support is STILL critical. Meet with your Congressperson (I'llhelp you do it) and get his/her support. Also call your local mediaans get them to cover the flight tests.

On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquirecelestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2)swing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinkedto the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activityfrom April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio RelayAntenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command losstimer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for theExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was receivedproperly.5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verifythe health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experimentdata; long term trend analysis is continuing.6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine theoptimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminaryanalysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulationindex is near the optimal level.7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for theExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thrusterflushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushedduring the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significantchanges (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  Thesemeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC specialanomaly team.10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15, 1993, is as follows:       a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees           off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within           acceptable range       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within           acceptable range       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours           Time To Initiation - 260 hoursGDS (Ground Data Systems):1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance testfor the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21(Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verifythe flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller(TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacementfor the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetryrates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC TelemetrySubsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA wasnot metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTSdata from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) ofthe TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.TRAJECTORY     As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectorystatus was as follows:Distance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU)Distance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU)Heliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hourDistance from Jupiter       543,973,900 kmRound Trip Light Time       17 minutes, 4 secondsSPECIAL TOPIC1.  As of April 15, 1993, a total of 70184 real-time commands have beentransmitted to Galileo since Launch.  Of these, 65076  were initiated in thesequence design process and 5108 initiated in the real-time command process.In the past week, 7 real time commands were transmitted: 6 were initiated inthe sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command process.Major command activities included commands to reacquire celestial reference,uplink the EJ-1 sequence memory load, and reset the command loss timer.     ___    _____     ___    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | Being cynical never helps /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | to correct the situation |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | and causes more aggravation                                                  | instead.

The question is what physical aspectssimply disallow earth like conditions.eg Temperature range of 280K to 315K (where temp is purely dependant on dist     from the sun and the suns temperature..)   Atmospheric presure ? - I know nothing of human tolerance   Planetary Mass ? - again gravity at surface is important, how much     can human bodies take day after day.  Also how does the mass effect     atmosphere.  I thinking of planets between .3 and 3 times mass of the     earth.  I suppose density should be important as well.Climate etc does not concern me, nor does axial tilt etc etc.  Just the abovethree factors and how they relate to one another.Jonathan-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  With fearsome eyes and fiery breath the dragon burnt the girl to death                    -- from "Too Late Saint George"

Doubtless it will fail to meet some ofthe promised goals.  The reason people are so fond of it is that it'sthe *only* chance we have now, or will have for a *long* time to come,to develop a launch vehicle with radically lower costs.  There is no Shuttle successor in funded development, NASP is dwindlingaway, and ALS/NLS/Spacelifter sure as hell aren't gonna knock anyzeroes off that $2000-$3000 per pound cost.   Part of the blame forthis must be placed on a Shuttle program that consumes many annualbillions of the, er, Free World's available space cash.  As you willno doubt hear from many correspondents in the days to come. (-:DC-X is an attempt to break out of the vicious cycle by keepingdevelopment costs low and flying incremental "X-plane" hardware.It's been, to my mind, incredibly successful already-- they've built acomplex prototype in under 600 days for under 60 megabucks.  I wouldhave been extremely skeptical that this could be accomplished in 1990sAmerica, never mind flying the thing, getting a successor funded, orbuilding the DC-Y.I'm sure you know well that launch costs are THE basic problem for anyexpansion of astronautics.  I don't see a realistic  prospect forbeating down those costs, for multi-ton payloads, anywhere else.  Ifthe DC flops, it'll be business as usual in space.  The Nineties andthe Double-Oughts will look just like the Seventies and Eighties, aprospect too depressing to bear.(Pegasus represents another assault on the problem from a differentdirection.  It doesn't lower cost-per-pound but it offers an orbitallaunch for under ten megabucks.  It's creating its own market forsmall payloads.)I read the magazines and I've attended the last two IAFs. There areplenty of engineers with paper ideas for cheaper launch systems, someof them as good as or better than SSTO.  There is no sign in today'sworld that any of these designs will be allowed anywhere near anassembly line.>You could change my view on DC-X if you could prove the following:[...deleting some things I'm not going to prove tonight...]>3  that the shuttle need not go on hiatus to allow development of a man-ratable>DC-X successorStrawman.  Is anybody seriously proposing this?  References, please. The DC must be developed in the real-world funding climate, whichincludes a NASA ferociously committed to continuing Shuttleoperations, as well as the "bird in the hand" argument your commonsense tells you.   If DC-Y flies at all, it flies alongside theShuttle, not instead of it.Also, of course, DC-Y and its operational descendants will be usefulfor a wide variety of jobs even if they are *not* man-rated.>4  Most importantly, that the DC-X will open up LEO to more scientific and>technical payloads.If a DC-X successor can fly a 10,000-kg payload for $1M, or even $5M,rather than the $40M it now costs, more people will be able to affordmore payloads... for the same money, you can fly several satellitesinstead of one.  Big outfits can fly multi-satellite series.  Littleoutfits will be able to fly spacecraft of their own, instead ofbegging a ride.  This is just supply and demand.  You should be ableto convince *yourself* that point 4 will be true, assuming DC makes abig difference in costs.  Do you have some reason to think not?

I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid,>even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved.I agree that the desire for beauty is valid, but I think your desire toimpose your vision of beauty is not.  You mention the age-old desire tosomehow get up there, but ignore the beauty of the actual achievmentof that vision.  You mention the beauty of a very dark sky, not impededby the effects of humans, but ignore the beauty of the as-dark-as-can-besky that is only visible from space, a vision that we, or at least,our descendents, may one day be able to see, in part, because of effortsthat others call ugly.  One day, I hope, humans will be able to look out,not upon half the heavens, with only nature-creted lights, but upon allof the heavens, with no lights.  If advertising in space can help us reachthat goal, it is no less beautiful for the way we reach it, than the'pristine' sky of yesteryear (or yester-century), which is totallyunreachable.  One of the original conceptions of beauty in wetsernsculpture was a human form, in the effort of striving to reach a goal.I don't think there's any reason to believe that modernity has changed that,just because it has changed the way we strive.BTW, there are places that people haven't fouled.

The kind of thing you're looking for is SDI-type assignments, but it'll be pretty prosaic stuff.Things like hard-kill ATBM missiles, some of the COBRA rigs -- that kind of thing.

After all the space walking,  they are going to  re-boost the HST'sorbit.  I think right now  it's sitting  at 180 miles up,they would like  220.  I don't know the exact orbit numbers.I know when HST was first flown, it was placed in the Highestpossible Shuttle orbit. Now the shuttle can cary a thing called the EDO pallet, or extendedduration orbiter pallet.  It's mostly  LOX/LH for the fuel cellsand RCS gear,  plus more O2  and canisters for the life supportre-breathers.  maybe more nitrogen too.THe limit on space-walking is a function of suit supplies (MASS)and Orbiter Duration.   In order to perform the re-boost of the HST, the OMS engineswill be fired for a long period.  Now the shuttle is a heavything.  THe HST isn't light either.  THe amount of OMS fuelneeded to fly both up is substantial.   a small boostercarried up and used to boost HST on it's own will weigh significantlyless then the OMS fuel required to Boost  both HST and SHUttle,for a given orbital change.  From what i understand,  the mass margins on the HST missions aretight enough they can't even carry extra Suits or MMU's.Now if they used a small tug,  I would bet,  just a wild guess,that the savings on amss margin  would allow carrying theEDO pallet,  extra suits,  more consumables,  parts for theflaky FGS sensor,  parts for the balky solar  electronics,and still enough for a double magnum of champagne.or the HST could even get placed into  some sort of medium orbit.The reason they want a high orbit, is less antenna pointing,and longer drag life.|> and  that means you can then carry EDO packs  and enough consumables|> so the SHuttle mission can go on long enough to also fix the|> array tilt motors,  and god knows what else  is going to wear out||From what I've heard, the motors are fine - it is one of the two |sets of electronics that control the motors that needs a fix.

I doubt that theactual fabrication cost in materials and labor would be very different fromSDIO's costs.Of course, this is my cynical opinion based on years of watching thegovernment procurement process try to cover up a lack of creativity andinnovation with reams of documentation. ;)

Some wonder whether or not the moon couldhave ever supported an atmosphere.  I'd be interested in knowing whatour geology/environmental sciences friends think.As for human tolerances, the best example of human endurance in termsof altitude (i.e. low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure)is in my opinion to the scaling of Mt. Everest without oxygen assistance.This was accomplished by a team of mountaineers who trained at highaltitudes for quite awhile (I think a few months) and then were flown byhelicopter from that training altitude to the equivalent altitude onMount Everest, where they began the ascent of our planet's highest peakwithout oxygen tanks.  This is quite a feat of physiological endurance, becauseif you or I tried to go to 20,000 feet and exert ourselves, we would probablypass out, get altitude sick, and could even die from cerebral edema. Sothis is the limit of low pressure.  High pressure situations would belimited by the duration of time which it takes to slowly acclimate to a higherpressure.  Skin divers would know alot about high pressure situations andcould tell you about how they safely make deep dives without getting thebends.  Some military experiments have put people under several atmospheres ofpressure (not sure what the high limit was because the papers aren't infront of me).  Usually at a certain point, the nitrogen in the air becomestoxic to the body and you start acting idiotic.  Divers call this nitrogennarcosis.  Those afflicted can do very dangerous and irrational things, liketaking off a diving mask and oxygen tank in order to talk to fish at 100 feetunder water.  (Hope any diving folk can elaborate on this matter, as Iam not a diving expert).Mars cannot support human life without pressurization because the atmosphereis too thin (1/100 th  our Earth's atmospheric density).  In addition,the Mars atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide.  Basically, you would need a pressure suit there, or you'd die from the low pressure.  Interesting huh?kenkhayash@hsc.usc.edu

Slower:  The shuttle mission is scheduled to go up in December.  That's lessthan eight months away.  There is no way you could build new hardware, retrainand reschedule the EVA's in that time.More Expensive:  Your proposal still requires the shuttle to do everything itwas going to do execpt fire the OMS.  In addition, you've added significantextra cost for a new piece of complex hardware.According to a GAO report on the OMV I have before me, there areonly two currently planned missions that could use such a vehicle -- HST andAXAF.  Since AXAF has since been scaled back and HST can rely on the shuttle,there doesn't seem to be any need for your vehicle.-- Josh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu    "Find a way or make one."             -attributed to Hannibal

When workers at the Kennedy Space Center disassembled the STS-56 solid rocket boosters they were surprised to find a pair of pliers lodged into the outside base of the right hand SRB.  The tool survived the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a 250,000 foot altitude, then down to splashdown and towing back to KSC.    NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone told the media,    "It's been a long time since something like this happened.  We've lost washers and bolts (before) but never a tool like this."    The initial investigation into the incident has shown that a Thiokol Corp. technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on April 2nd.  Unfortunately, the worker's supervisor did not act on the report and Discovery was launched with its "extra payload".  NASA officials were never told of the missing tool before the April 8th launch date.    The free-flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB technician.  When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster, its 18-inch long rope was still attached.  The pliers were found in a part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad.|(Ron's ed. note:  naaahhh,  just too easy)    A spokesperson for the Lockheed Space Operations Company said that the Shuttle processor will take "appropriate action".  Thiokol is a subcontractor to LSOC for work to prepare Shuttle hardware for launch._________________________________________________________Karl AndersonDEV/2000: Configuration Management/Version ControlDept 53K/006-2Rochester, Minnesota 55901253-8044Tie 8-453-8044INTERNET: karl@vnet.ibm.comPRODIGY: CMMG96A"To seek, to strive, to find, and not to yield."Alfred Lord Tennyson

I've transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no meansinfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is granted to copy this without restriction.Note for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing asingle staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3scale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is currently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale experimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.On April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled "Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions" here at the University ofIllinois. Mr Nelson's job involves using software to simulate trajectories anddetermine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he isnot directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with them recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used the DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don't think the detailsof implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hopethey aren't - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you willbe interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.The first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  Themain restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume thatthis is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but Idid not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boostersand 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in mid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelsonshowed the following plot of acceleration vs time:                  ______3 G         /|   /      |           / |  /       |          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly           /  | /        |   good.  The big difference is that the lines2 G      /   |/         |          made by the  /  should be curves which are        /               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as       /                |          the graph wasn't up for very long.1 G   /                 |                        |                        |0 G                     |             ^          ^           ~100 sec    ~400 secAs mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel theaccelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are throtled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so itsoon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in accelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer enginesbring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cutout entirely.The engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimedfor an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges ofair drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to that desired.Questions from the audience:  (paraphrased)Q:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than    all at once?A:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.Q:  So what was the final payload for this trajectory?A:  Can't tell us.  "Read Aviation Leak."  He also apparently had a good     propulsion example, but was told not to use it.  My question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protectingnational security or MD protecting their own interests?The second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitchup maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and the parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphsof heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar,and I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate.The end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would haveabout 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it's reentry profile about 60 degrees south latitude.I would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn't know about thataspect of the flight profile.-- Josh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu    "Find a way or make one."             -attributed to Hannibal

The whole question of "a right to a dark sky" revolves around thedefinition of a right.  Moral rights and natural rights are all well andgood, but as far as I can see, a right is whatever you or someonerepresenting you can enforce.  In most civilizations, the government orthe church (or both) defines what the rights of the citizens are, andthen enforces those rights for them.  Here in the U.S., the constitutionprovides a "Bill of Rights" from which most if not all legal rights areconsidered to derive.  I'm sure that most other countries havecomparable documents.  If you can persuade a court that you have a rightto a dark sky derived in some manner from the Bill of Rights (in theU.S.), you can prevent (maybe) these billboards from being launched.

I'm sure the burst detectors thathave flown on other deep-space missions haven't weighed that much.(Mind you, they're probably still too heavy -- the PFF people would putmore Pluto-specific instruments on first, if they had any mass to spare.)-- SVR4 resembles a high-speed collision   | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoologybetween SVR3 and SunOS.    - Dick Dunn  |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry

To the North Pole!        On June 2 and 7, 1983, two of the Soviet Union's mighty PROTON     rockets lifted off from the Tyuratam Space Center in the Kazakhstan     Republic.  Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe     for the planet Venus.         Designated VENERA 15 and 16, the probes were meant not for landing    yet more spherical craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the    planet in detail from orbit.  To accomplish this task, the basic    VENERA design was modified in numerous areas.  The central bus core    was made one meter (39.37 inches) longer to carry the two tons of    propellant required for braking into orbit, double the fuel carried by    the VENERA 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier.  Extra solar panels    were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large    amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging.  The    dish-shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger     to properly transmit this information to Earth.         Atop the buses, where landers were usually placed, were installed    the 1.4 by 6-meter (4.62 by 19.8-foot), 300-kilogram (660-pound)    POLYUS V side-looking radar antennae.  The radar system, possibly a    terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellites used by     the Soviets for Earth ocean surveillance, would be able to map Venus'    surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers (0.62 to 1.2 miles).         The Soviet probes' imaging parameters were a vast improvement over    the United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter, which could reveal objects     no smaller than 75 kilometers (45 miles) in diameter.  And while the    VENERAs' resolution was comparable to that of similar observations     made by the 300-meter (1,000-foot) Arecibo radio telescope on the     island of Puerto Rico, the orbiters would be examining the northern    pole of Venus.  This region was unobtainable by either Arecibo or     PIONEER VENUS and appeared to contain a number of potentially     interesting geological features worthy of investigation.        On October 10, 1983, after an interplanetary journey of 330     million kilometers (198 million miles) and two mid-course corrections,     VENERA 15 fired its braking rockets over Venus to place itself in a     polar orbit 1,000 by 65,000 kilometers (600 by 39,000 miles) around     the planet, completing one revolution every twenty-four hours.  VENERA     16 followed suit four days later.  The twin probes thus became Venus'     first polar-circling spacecraft.        Radar operations began on October 16 for VENERA 15 and October 20     for VENERA 16.  For up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north    pole, the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers     (ninety miles) wide and nine thousand kilometers (5,400 miles) long.      The craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over     the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back     to two large Soviet antennae on Earth.  Each strip of information took     eight hours to process by computer.  By the end of their main missions     in July of 1984, the VENERAs had mapped 115 million square kilometers     (46 million square miles), thirty percent of the entire planet.        VENERA 15 and 16 revealed that Venus has a surface geology more    complex than shown by PIONEER VENUS in the late 1970s.  Numerous hills,     mountains, ridges, valleys, and plains spread across the landscape,     many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the     last one billion years.  In planetary terms this makes the Venerean     surface rather young.  Hundreds of craters were detected as well, the     largest of which had to have been created by meteorites (planetoids     would be a better term here) at least fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles)     across, due to Venus' very dense atmosphere.        There were some disagreements between U.S. and Soviet scientists    on the origins of certain surface features.  For example, the probes'     owners declared that the 96-kilometer (57.6-mile) wide crater at the     summit of 10,800-meter (35,640-foot) high Maxwell Montes, the tallest     mountain on the planet, was the result of a meteorite impact.  American     scientists, on the other hand, felt the crater was proof that Maxwell     was a huge volcano sitting on the northern "continent" of Ishtar Terra.          In any event, the U.S. decided to wait on making verdicts about    Venus until the arrival of their own radar probe, scheduled for later    in the decade.  Originally named the Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar    (VOIR), its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig-    nated the Venus Radar Mapper (VRM).  Eventually the machine would be     called MAGELLAN, after the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan     (circa 1480-1521).  This vehicle would map the entire planet in even     finer detail than the VENERAs.  For the time, however, the Soviet     probes maintained that distinction.        Radar imaging was not the only ability of the VENERAs.  Bolted    next to the POLYUS V radar antenna were the Omega altimeter and the     Fourier infrared spectrometer, the latter for measuring the world's    temperatures.  The majority of the areas covered registered about    five hundred degrees Celsius (932 degrees Fahrenheit), but a few    locations were two hundred degrees hotter, possibly indicating     current volcanic activity.  The probes also found that the clouds     over the poles were five to eight kilometers (three to 4.8 miles)     lower than at the equator.  In contrast, the polar air above sixty     kilometers (thirty-six miles) altitude was five to twenty degrees     warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights.        When the main mapping mission ended in July of 1984, there were     plans for at least one of the VENERAs to radar image the surface at     more southernly latitudes.  Unfortunately this idea did not come to     pass, as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude-control    gas to perform the operation.          VENERA 15 and 16 ceased transmission in March of 1985, leaving     the Soviet Institute of Radiotechnology and Electronics with six     hundred kilometers (360 miles) of radar data tape to sort into an     atlas of twenty-seven maps of the northern hemisphere of Venus.        Venus by Balloon        For years the thick atmosphere of Venus had been a tempting     target to scientists who wished to explore the planet's mantle of     air with balloon-borne instruments.  Professor Jacques Blamont of     the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)    had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967, only to have a joint     French-Soviet balloon mission canceled in 1982.  Nevertheless,     late in the year 1984, such dreams would eventually come true.        When two PROTON rockets were sent skyward on December 15 and 21,     the Soviet Union provided Western observers with the first clear, full     views of the booster which had been launching every Soviet Venus probe     since 1975.  This was but one of many firsts for the complex mission.        The unmanned probes launched into space that December were named    VEGA 1 and 2, a contraction of the words VENERA and GALLEI - Gallei    being the Russian word for Halley.  Not only did the spacecraft     have more than one mission to perform, they also had more than one     celestial objective to explore, namely the comet Halley.          This famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to     the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910.    Since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from    the formation of the solar system five billion years ago, scientists     around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such     bodies which actually come close to Earth.          Most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar     system.  Some, like Halley, are perturbed by various forces and fall     in towards the Sun, where they circle for millennia spewing out ice     and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar     encounter.        The Soviet Union, along with the European Space Agency (ESA) and    Japan's Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), did not    wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a    close examination of Halley.  The ESA would be using the cylindrical    GIOTTO probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the     comet, while Japan's first deep space craft - SAKIGAKE (Pioneer) and     SUISEI (Comet) - would view Halley from a much safer distance.         Scientists in the United States also desired to study the comet    from the vantage of a space probe, at one time envisioning a vessel    powered by solar sails or ion engines.  However, government budget    cuts to NASA canceled the American efforts.  The U.S. would have to    make do primarily with Earth-based observations and the sharing of     data from other nations, though an instrument named the Dust Counter     and Mass Analyzer (DUCMA), designed by Chicago University Professor     John Simpson, was added on the Soviet mission in May of 1984.        The Soviets' answer to Halley were the VEGAs.  Instead of building    an entirely new craft for the mission, the Soviets decided to modify    their VENERA bus design to encounter the comet while performing an     advanced Venus mission along the way.  As VEGA 1 and 2 reached Venus,    the buses would drop off one lander/balloon each and use the mass of     the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet Halley, much as the     U.S. probe MARINER 10 used Venus to flyby Mercury eleven years earlier.     The Soviet craft would then head on to Halley, helping to pinpoint the     location of the comet's erupting nucleus for the GIOTTO probe to dive     in only 605 kilometers (363 miles) away in March of 1986.        As planned, the two VEGAs arrived at Venus in June of 1985.  VEGA    1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month, the lander    making a two-day descent towards the planet.  The craft touched the    upper atmosphere on the morning of June 11.  Sixty-one kilometers    (36.6 miles) above the Venerean surface a small container was released    by the lander, which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers (33 miles)    altitude.  Thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus had    successfully arrived.         One kilometer after the opening of the parachute, helium gas was    pumped into the Teflon-coated plastic balloon, inflating it to a    diameter of 3.54 meters (11.68 feet).  Dangling on a tether thirteen    meters (42.9 feet) below was the instrument package, properly known as    an aerostat.  The top part of the 6.9-kilogram (15.18-pound) aerostat    consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment    point to the balloon.  Beneath it was the transmitter, electronics,    and instruments.  Connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for    measuring cloud particles.  The aerostat was painted with a special    white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which    permeated the planet's atmosphere.         The VEGA 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of Venus just    north of the equator.  Scientists were concerned that the gas bag     would burst in the heat of daylight, so they placed it in the darkened     hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data.      This action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as     well, effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions.      The author wonders, though, if they could have used floodlights similar     to the ones attached to VENERA 9 and 10 in 1975, when Soviet scientists     had thought the planet's surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight     due to the permanently thick cloud cover.        The first balloon transmitted for 46.5 hours right into the day    hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed, covering 11,600    kilometers (6,960 miles).  The threat of bursting in the day heat did    not materialize.  The VEGA 1 balloon was stationed at a 54-kilometer    (32.4-mile) altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers    (thirty miles), for this was considered the most active of the three    main cloud layers reported by PIONEER VENUS in 1978.  Indeed the    balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers    (150 miles) per hour.  Strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and    down two to three hundred meters (660 to 990 feet) through most of the    journey.  The layer's air temperature averaged forty degrees Celsius    (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and pressure was a mere 0.5 Earth atmosphere.    The nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds.         Early in the first balloon's flight, the VEGA 1 lander was already    headed towards the Venerean surface.  Both landers were equipped with    a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on VENERA 13     and 14 in 1982.  However, VEGA 1 would become unable to report the    composition of the ground at its landing site in Rusalka Planitia, the    Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra.  While still ten to fifteen    minutes away from landing, a timer malfunction caused the drill to     accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers (9.6     miles) above the surface.         There was neither any way to shut off the instrument before    touchdown nor reactivate it after landing.  This was unfortunate not    only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of    Venus was covered with such smooth low-level lava plains and had never     before been directly examined.  Nevertheless, the surface temperature     and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees Celsius (874.4 degrees     Fahrenheit) and 95 Earth atmospheres respectively during the lander's     56 minutes of ground transmissions.  A large amount of background     infrared radiation was also recorded at the site.        As had been done when the drills and cameras on VENERA 11 and     12 had failed in December of 1978, the Soviets focused on the data    returned during the lander's plunge through the atmosphere.  The    French-Soviet Malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur, chlorine,     and possibly phosphorus.  It is the sulfur - possibly from active     volcanoes - which gives the Venerean clouds their yellowish color.    The Sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air    between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers (28.8 and 37.8 miles)    contained one milligram (0.015 grain) of sulfuric acid.        The VEGA 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks     appeared to be at odds with the information from PIONEER VENUS.    The case was made even stronger by the fact that VEGA 2's results    nearly matched its twin.  The VEGAs found only two main cloud layers     instead of the three reported by the U.S. probes.  The layers were     three to five kilometers (1.8 to 3 miles) thick at altitudes of 50     and 58 kilometers (30 and 34.8 miles).  The clouds persisted like a    thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers (21 miles),     much lower than the PV readings.  One possibility for the discrepan-    cies may have been radical structural changes in the Venerean air     over the last seven years.        When the lander and balloon finally went silent, the last     functioning part of the VEGA 1 mission, the flyby bus, sailed on    for a 708 million-kilometer (424.8 million-mile) journey around    the Sun to become the first probe to meet comet Halley.  On March    6, 1986, the bus made a 8,890-kilometer (5,334-mile) pass at the     dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space.    The Soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial    bodies with one space vessel.        On June 13, VEGA 2 released its lander/balloon payload for    a two-day fall towards Venus.  Like its duplicate, the VEGA 2    balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking    it on Earth for 46.5 hours before battery failure on the morning    side of the planet.  During its 11,100-kilometer (6,660-mile)    flight over Venus, the second balloon entered in a rather still    environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission.    After 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent     for a further eight hours.  When the balloon passed over a five-    kilometer (three-mile) mountain on the "continent" of Aphrodite     Terra, a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 2.5 kilometers (1.5     miles) towards the surface.        Temperature sensors on the VEGA 2 balloon reported that the air     layer it was moving through was consistently 6.5 degrees Celsius     (43.7 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than the area explored by the VEGA 1    balloon.  This was corroborated by the VEGA 2 lander as it passed     through the balloon's level.  No positive indications of lightning    were made by either balloon, and the second aerostat's nephelometer     failed to function.        The VEGA 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of Aphrodite    Terra's western arm on the fifteenth of June, 1,500 kilometers (900    miles) southeast of VEGA 1.  The lander's resting place was smoother    than thought, indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a    relatively young one covered in fresh lava.  The soil drill was in    working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite-troctolite,     rare on Earth but present in Luna's highlands.  This rock is rich in     aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium.  A high degree     of sulfur was also present in the soil.  The air around VEGA 2 measured     463 degrees Celsius (865.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and 91 Earth atmospheres,    essentially a typical day (or night) on Venus.        Far above the VEGA 2 lander, its carrier bus sped past Venus at    a distance of 24,500 kilometers (14,700 miles) and followed its twin     to comet Halley, making a closer flyby on March 9, 1986 at just 8,030     kilometers (4,818 miles).  Both probes helped to reveal that the comet     is a very dark and irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometers     (8.4 miles) across, rotating once every 53 hours, give or take three     hours.        Since both VEGA craft were still functioning after their Halley    encounters, Soviet scientists considered an option to send the     probes to other celestial objects.  One prime target was the near-    Earth planetoid 2101 Adonis, which VEGA 2 could pass at a distance     of six million kilometers (3.6 million miles).  Sadly, the Soviets     had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly     a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was     not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach Adonis as planned.      VEGA 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987.        Future Plans Diverted        The impressive VEGA mission had given some scientists numerous     ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second     world from the Sun.  One example was the VESTA mission, planned for    the early 1990s.        This Soviet-French collaboration called for the launch of multiple     probes on a single PROTON rocket in either 1991 or 1992.  The craft     would first swing by Venus and drop off several landers and balloon     probes.  The aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet's     corrosive atmosphere for up to one month, a large improvement over     the VEGA balloons' two days.  The mission would then head out to     investigate several planetoids and comets, including a possible     landing on Vesta (thus the mission name), the most reflective Main     Belt planetoid as seen from Earth.        Unfortunately for Venus exploration, plans began to change in    the Soviet Union.  In 1986 the Soviets decided to reroute the VESTA    mission to the red planet Mars instead of Venus, keeping the comet    and planetoid aspects intact.  By this time in the Soviet space     program interest was focusing on Mars.  Already under construction     was an entirely new probe design called PHOBOS.  Two members of this     class were planned to leave Earth in 1988 and orbit Mars the next     year.  PHOBOS 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on    Mars' largest moon, Phobos.         All this was a prelude to even more advanced Mars expeditions,    including balloon probes, rovers, soil sample return craft, and     eventually human explorers in the early Twenty-First Century.    The environment of Venus was just too hostile for any serious    consideration of human colonization in the near future.        But things began to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars    exploration.  Both PHOBOS probes failed to complete their missions,    one losing contact on the way to the Red Planet in 1988 and the other    going silent in Mars orbit just one week before the planned moon    landing in March of 1989.         In 1989 a plan was devised for a Venus orbiter to drop eight to    ten penetrators around the planet in 1998.  Several years later the    mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put     on indefinite hold.  No other official Soviet missions to Venus have    since been put forth, a sad commentary after twenty-five years of    continuous robotic exploration of the planet.         During the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change    was taking over the Soviet Union.  President Mikhail Gorbachev began     to "open up" his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with     the rest of the nations, particularly those in the West.  While the     culture became less oppressive than in the past, the economy was taking     a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a "free market".        These effects hit everywhere, including the space program.    Missions at all levels were cut back.  The Soviets began making    almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space-faring    nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to     make money.          In early 1992 it was reported that the Soviets were offering for     sale several fully-equipped VENERAs they had in storage for the price     of 1.6 million dollars each, an incredibly low price for any planetary     probe.  No nation took them up on the bargain.  Meanwhile the United     States was gearing up for new Venus missions of their own.        MAGELLAN and GALILEO         The U.S. reactivated their long-dormant planetary exploration    with the launch of the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS on May 4, 1989.    Aboard the Shuttle was the MAGELLAN spacecraft, a combination of    spare parts from other U.S. probes designed to make the most     detailed and complete radar-mapping of Venus in history.  When    MAGELLAN reached the second world in August of 1990, it would be    able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108    meters (360 feet), surpassing the abilities of VENERA 15 and 16.        In the interim another American probe was launched from a Space     Shuttle which would make a quick flyby of Venus on its way to orbit     the giant planet Jupiter in 1995.  On October 18, 1989, the Shuttle     ATLANTIS released its second unmanned planetary probe into space,     named GALILEO after the famous Italian astronomer who discovered the     probe's primary target's major moons in 1610.        In the absence of a powerful enough booster to send GALILEO on    a direct flight to the Jovian planet, the probe was sent around    Venus and Earth several times to build up enough speed to reach    Jupiter.  As a result, Venus became GALILEO's first planetary    goal in February of 1990.  The probe radioed back images of the    planet's swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in    that violent atmosphere.        On the Drawing Boards        With the incredible success of MAGELLAN in the last few years,    new plans have been laid out for further journeys to Venus.  Scien-    tists in the U.S. have talked to space scientists in the former Soviet     Union - now the Commonwealth of Independent States since January 1,     1992 - of a cooperative effort to launch new VENERA lander missions     within in the next decade.  Japan, India, and the ESA have also    considered their own Venus missions in the next few decades.        In February of 1993 NASA came up with several new Venus projects     as part of their Discovery Program for launching inexpensive probes    throughout the solar system.  For Venus two missions were selected    for further study:  A Venus Multiprobe Mission involving the landing    of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds, air    temperature, and pressure; and the Venus Composition Probe, designed    to study Venus' atmosphere while descending through the thick air    with the aid of a parachute, much as the Soviets had done since 1967.    Final project decisions will be made in 1994.        Humans on Venus              Will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus?    At present the lead-melting temperatures and crushing air pressure    would be threatening to any Earth life not protected in something    even tougher than a VENERA lander.  Plans have been looked into    changing the environment of Venus itself into something more like    Earth's.  However, it should be noted that any such undertaking    will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide     atmosphere, a major reduction in surface heat, and the ability     to speed up the planet's rotation rate to something a bit faster    than once every 243 Earth days.  Such a project may take centuries    if not millennia.        In the meantime efforts should be made to better understand    Venus as its exists today.  We still have yet to fully know how    a world so seemingly similar to Earth in many important ways became    instead such a deadly place.  Will Earth ever suffer this fate?    Perhaps Venus holds the answers.  Such answers may best be found    through international cooperation, including the nation which     made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from Venus.

The differential arrival time techiniquerequires interplanetary baselines to get good positions.  Thedifferential arrival at the eight detectors differ by 10's of nanoseconds.This is smaller than BATSE's microsecond timing capabilities.BATSE, Ulysses, and Mars Obsverver are used for this technique.Each BATSE detector does not have a full sky field of view.The sensitivity of each detector decreases with increasing angle of incidence.  The burst position on the sky is determined bycomparing the count rates in different detectors.Pat

Well, I was deadwrong.  Our local interstellar dust expert, Bruce Draine, hasinformed me that dust grains _aren't_ good radiators in the far IR,which is why they are so warm; actually, the ambient radiation fieldfrom distant stars can bring a true blackbody to only 3 or 4 Kelvin.Sorry, Henry, and anyone else I misled.  Obviously, time for me totake another ISM class :-(  In other news, Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute gavea talk on the Pluto-Charon binary system yesterday.  He gave a briefoverview of the currently-accepted system parameters (volume ratio ofabout 8:1, mass ratio about 15:1 or so, plus lots more...) and thengave his thoughts on the formation of Pluto-Charon.  His idea is that there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outersolar system, with masses distributed as a power law of some kind;over time, the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies.  Most gotscattered out of the solar system by close encounters with Jupiterand Saturn, but many accreted into the gas giants, especiallyUranus and Neptune.  A large planetesimal was captured by Neptune -we call it Triton [captured how?  Perhaps by a collision with a smaller,already-existing Neptunian moon, perhaps by a very close passage throughNeptune's atmosphere - mondo aerobraking!].  He notes that the two recently discovered "Kuiper Belt" objects,1992 QB1 and 1993 FW, plus Chiron and Pholus, are all about the same mass, and he identifies this group as one-accretion-down from thelarger bodies of Triton and Pluto/Charon.  Pluto/Charon, he thinks,formed when an impacting body hit proto-Pluto, knocking some materialinto a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Charon; similar toideas about the formation of Earth's moon.  There is good evidencefrom spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Charon are very different(Pluto has methane frost, Charon doesn't), which can be used as evidencefor the impact theory.  He believes that there may be around 1000 Pluto-to-Chiron-sized objectsremaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune's orbit, beyond 35 AU or so.  1992 QB1 and 1993 FW are the first membersof this population to be found, in his model.  Note that such bodieswill be very dark, since if their surfaces are covered with methane frost, it will have photolyzed into very dark, long-chain hydrocarbonsby now.  The reason that Pluto has such a high albedo (around 0.5, I think)is that its surface warms up JUST enough around perihelion to sublimate,and when the atmosphere freezes out again, thirty years later, it formsbright, new frost.  So any bodies much farther away than 30 AU are goingto be very hard to see.  I hope I haven't made any errors in the transcription; if you seea howling mistake, it's undoubtedly mine, not his.  By the way, he's one of the top guns behind the Pluto Fast Flybymission (I think), and said that the current plans are to use aTitan 4 to send the probe on "just about a rectilinear trajectory"to Pluto (we were speaking loosely at the time...).  He'd liketo use a Proton, which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costsMUCH less.  His figures: $500 Million for 2 Titan 4 launches (therewill be two separate probes, launched separately), or $120 Millionfor 2 Proton launches.  He told a story about how the Soviets originallyoffered to sell Proton launches for $30 Million each, but were forcedto increase their prices in the US in order to be allowed in themarketplace.  I'm just telling you what he said.

Theday-long meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City, VA; topicscovered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement forthe space station; science, technology and engineering research; theassessment process; and the design approach. Discussions on managementoptions and operations concepts also were held.The Design Teams then presented the three options under study: Option A - Modular Buildup -- Pete Priest presented the A option. Priestsaid the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and hasidentified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tendedand permanent presence. The team will define the minimum capability neededto achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievablecapability for budget levels. The A option uses current or simplifiedFreedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existingsystems such as the so-called "Bus-1 spacecraft," the orbiter and Spacelab.The Power Station Capability could be achieved in 3 flights with Freedomphoto voltaic modules providing 20 kW of power. 30-day Shuttle/Spacelabmissions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase.Human Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the U.S.Common Module Module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and dockingports for ESA and Japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiterdocked to the station are assumed for this phase. Differentoperation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase. Option B - Freedom Derived -- Mike Griffin presented the status of OptionB activities. Griffin detailed the evolution of the Freedom-derived option,from initial Research Capability, to Human-Tended Capability, to PermanentHuman Presence Capability, to Two Fault Tolerance, and finally PermanentHuman Capability. Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to thebaseline program, with minor changes to the Communications and Trackingsystem, Crew Health Care System and ECLSS, and a major change to the DataManagement System.Initial Research Capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degreeinclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended durationorbiter-Spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaicarrays providing 18.75 kW of power.Human-Tended Capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add trusssegments and the U.S. lab.Permanent Human Presence Capability would be achieved in 8 flights with twoorbiters providing habitation and assured crew return.Two Fault Tolerance, achieved in 11 flights, would build out the othersection of truss with another set of PV modules, thermal control andpropulsion systems.The freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Completestate with 16 flights.  Three more flights, to bring up the habitat module,a third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles (ACRV) would completethe Permanent Human Capability with International stage.Griffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardwarewould not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derivedoption.  Major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas includingprogram management, contractor non-hardware, early utilization andoperations costs, he said. Option C - Singe Launch Core Station -- Chet Vaughn presented Option C,the Single Launch Core Station concept.  A Shuttle external tank and solidrocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit.  Shuttlemain engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launchand jettisoned after ET separation.The module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000cubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 "decks" connected by acentralized passageway.  Seven berthing ports would be located at variousplaces on the circumference of the module to place the internationalmodules, and other elements.  This "can" would have two fixed photo voltaicarrays producing approximately 40 kW of power flying in a solar interialattitude.In his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee, Bryan O'Connorsaid a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on April 26 sothat detailed costing of the options can begin.  The next meeting with theRedesign Advisory Committee will be May 3.Russian Consultants Arrive in U.S. -- A delegation of 16 Russian spaceexperts arrived in the U.S. on April 21 and briefings to the SRT by membersof the Russian team began on the 22nd.  The group includes Russian SpaceAgency General Director Y. M. Koptev, and V. A. Yatsenko, also of the RSA. Others on the team include representatives from the Ministry of Defense,the Design Bureau SALYUT, the Institute of Biomedical Problems, theMinistry of Foreign Affairs, NPO Energia and TsNIJMASH.  The Russian teambriefed the SRT on environmental control and life support system, dockingsystems, the Proton launch vehicle, Mir operations and utilization, and theSoyuz TM spacecraft.The Russian consultants are available to the SRT to assess the capabilitiesof the Mir space station, and the possible use of Mir and other Russiancapabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign.  They willbe available to the SRT through May 5.Management and Operations Review Continues --  Work continued in the SRTsubgroups.  The Management Group under Dr. Walt Brooks is working todevelop a family of options that solve the current problems and build afoundation for the transition to development and operations.  Variousmanagement options have been developed including: Lead Center with the Center Director in the programmatic chain ofcommand. Host Center with the Program Manager reporting directly to an AssociateAdministrator. Skunk Works/Dedicated Program Office with a small dedicated co-locatedhand-picked program office. Combine Space Station with Shuttle, with the space station becoming anelement of the current program. Major Tune Up to Current Organization, with current contracts andgeographical distribution maintained but streamlined.The Operations Group under Dr. John Cox is building on the work of theOperations Phase Assessment Team lead by Gene Kranz of NASA-JSC, which hadalready begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in itspreliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible.As part of its work,  the Operations Group has identified teams of agencyexperts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas ofassembly and operations, utilization, maintenance and logistics and testingand ground operations.What's in the Week Ahead? -- The Design Support Teams will provide acomprehensive status of their option to the Station Redesign Team on Mondayand Tuesday at which point the design will be "frozen" to begin thedetailed cost assessment.   Also this week, the team will begin preparingfor the next round of discussions with the redesign Advisory Committee, tobe held May 3.Dr. Shea Steps Down --  Dr. Joe Shea stepped down as director of theStation Redesign Team on April 22 and Bryan O'Connor will take over theactivities of the team.  Dr. Shea submitted his resignation as assistantdeputy administrator for space station analysis, but will continue to serveas a special advisory to NASA Administrator Goldin and be available toconsult with the SRT. Mr Goldin accepted the resignation so that a requestfrom Dr. Shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated.Key Milestones -- The key dates for the SRT as they are currently beingcarried on the schedule are:April 26Design Freeze on Options for CostingApril 27Design Support Team Present Selected Options to SRTMay 3Status report to Redesign Advisory CommitteeMay 15Interim report by Redesign Advisory CommitteeJune 7Final report to Redesign Advisory Committee(Oct. 31-cancellation .....just my opinion...AC)

Well in a way it is, but in a way it is reality.There is a billin the congress to do just that.. Basically to make it soexpensive to mine minerals in the US, unless you can by off the inspectors ortax collectors.. ascially what I understand from talking to a few miner friends of mine, that they (the congress) propose to have a tax on the gross income ofthe mine, versus the adjusted income, also the state governments have therenormal taxes. So by the time you get done, paying for materials, workers, andother expenses you can owe more than what you made.BAsically if you make a 1000.00 and spend 500. ofor expenses, you can owe600.00 in federal taxes.. Bascially it is driving the miners off the land.. Andthe only peopel who benefit are the eco-freaks.. Basically to get back to my beginning statement, is space is the way to gocause it might just get to expensive to mine on earth because of either theeco-freaks or the protectionist.. Such fun we have in these interesting times..==Michael Adams, nsmca@acad3.alaska.edu -- I'm not high, just jacked
