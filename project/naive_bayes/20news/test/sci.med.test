I've been trying to read up on these two conditions, and what reallysurprises me is how few experiments have been done and how little is known. Losing weight appears to be imperative for diabetes and advisable forarthritis (at least, for -women- with arthritis), but, of course, the veryconditions that make weight loss advisable are part of the reason for theweight gain. For myself, I'm almost afraid to lose weight, because no matter how gentleand sensible a diet I use (the last one was 1800-2000 calories, in abouteight small meals), the weight won't go off gradually and stay off. Instead, it drops off precipitously, and then comes back on with muchinterest, like bread on the waters.With this experience, it's hard to be encouraging to my husband.  All I cansuggest is to make it as gradual as possible.Meanwhile, some experts recommend no sugar, others, no fat, others, just abalanced diet.  It's almost impossible to tell from their writings -which-parts of their recommendations are supposed to help the condition, andwhich are merely ideas the expert thinks are nifty.Is it my imagination, or are these very old conditions very poorlyunderstood?  Is it just that I'm used to pediatrician-talk ("It's strep;give him this and he'll get well.") and so my expectations are too high? Bonita Kale

This is very interesting. I have come exactly to the same conclusions but in regards to *conventional* medicine. You see, I don't just treat little old ladies that wouldn't know any different of what is being done, but a bulk of my patients consist of teachers, lawyers, judges, nurses, accountants, university graduates, and various health practitioners. If these people have gotten results with my method after having been unsuccessful with yours or their own, I certainly wouldn't lose any  sleep over whether you or your peers approve of my treatments ---  let's face it, with all the blunders committed by "scientific" MDs  over the years, I know a lot of people who hold your *scientific*  method in much lower esteem than they hold mine!GR>  As far as we know ayurveda = crystals = homeopathy = Ron RothGR>  which may all equal placebo administered with appropriateGR>  trappings...

I use homeopathy very little, since my cellular test (EMR) is hard to beat for accuracy and minerals are more predictable, while homeopathy does have a problem with reliability, especially in acute conditions.

If you were to cook a meal, would you worry over whether EVERYONE  in this world would find it to their liking, or only those that end  up eating it? Since I have financed every research project that I have undertaken  entirely myself, I don't need to follow any of your rules or guide- lines to satisfy any aspects of a grant application, which YOU may  have to; neither am I concerned of whether or not my study designs  meet your or anyone else's criteria or acceptance.

Genetic engineering of course is now the final frontier to show God how it is (properly) done. Now we've become capable of creating our own paradise and give disease (and God) the boot, right? But just before we get rid of Him for good, perhaps He could leave us some pointers on how to solve a couple of tiny problems, such as war,  poverty, racism, crime, riots, substance abuse...

Sometimes a very flabby muscle will look like "fat",so when that muscle gains some muscle tone it may *appear* as though the "fat"is "changing" into "muscle", but really fat and muscle tissues are totallyseparate, and one does not ever "change into" the other.------------------------Ruth Ginzberg <rginzberg@eagle.wesleyan.edu>Philosophy Department;Wesleyan University;USA

As far as I can see if your obstetrition has an ultrasound in his roomsand is expirienced its use and interpretation, he should be just ascapable of reading it as any radiologist. All doctors are "qualified" toread x-rays, u/s, ct scans etc. it is just that a radiologist does nothingelse, and thus, is only better at reading them because of all this timespent doing this (skill in reading x-rays etc. just comes from plenty ofpractice).

Changes things a bit, eh?You complain that people blame MSG automatically, since it's an unknown andtherefore must be the cause.  It is equally (if not more) unreasonable todefend it, automatically assuming that it CAN'T be the culprit.Pepper makes me sneeze.

I can stickit in at a 90 degree angle, and barely feel it.  I'm not fat, justhave a little gut.  My legs however, are muscular, and I have to pinchto get anything, and then I inject at about a 45 degree angle,and itstill hurts.  The rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and  muscular injections however--so if it's a daily thing it would bebest not to switch places every day to keep consistencey.  Althoughsome suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot, to prevent irritation.  When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep, wait for it to dry somewhat, or you may get the alcohol in thepuncture, and of course, that doesn't feel good.  A way to preventirratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way todo this is use a little round bandage and put it over the spot.  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot,and spacing the sites out accuartely (about 1 1/2 " apart.)This is from experience, so I hope it'll help you.

There>is a book "The Yeast Connection" which talks about this "illness".>>There is no convincing evidence that such a disease exists.There's a lot of evidence, it just hasn't been adequately gathered andpublished in a way that will convince the die-hard melancholic skepticswho quiver everytime the word 'anecdote' or 'empirical' is used.For example, Dr. Ivker, who wrote the book "Sinus Survival", always gives,before any other treatment, a systemic anti-fungal (such as Nizoral) to hisnew patients IF they've been on braod-spectrum anti-biotics 4 or more timesin the last two years.  He's kept a record of the results, and for over 2000 patients found that over 90% of his patients get significant reliefof allergic/sinus symptoms.  Of course, this is only the beginning for hisprogram.In my case, as I reported a few weeks ago, I was developing the classicsymptoms outlined in 'The Yeast Connection' (I agree it is a poorly written book):  e.g., extreme sensitivity to plastics, vapors, etc. whichI never had before (started in November).  Within one week of full dosageof Sporanox, the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - I cannow sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  I'm also*greatly* improved in other areas as well.Of course, I have allergy symptoms, etc.  I am especially allergic tomolds, yeasts, etc.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out thatif one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body, and you have anatural allergy to yeasts, that a threshold would be reached where youwould have perceptible symptoms.  Also, yeast do produce toxins of varioussorts, and again, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize thatsuch toxins can cause problems in some people.  In my case it was sinussince that's the center of my allergic response.  Of course, the $60,000question is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed I wasfrom over 5 years of antibiotics, nutritionally-deficiencies because of thestress of infections and allergies, etc.), can develop excessive yeastcolonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer sincetesting for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has totake an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately, Sporanox is relativelysafe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful, however) so there'sno reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons.BTW, some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately, most yeast grows hyphaetoo deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  You'll finda lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time.In summary, I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keepmedicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmlyto the party line are academics who haven't been in the trenches long enoughactually treating patients.  If anybody, doctors included, said to me to myface that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection', I cannot guaranteetheir safety.

I first heard about it in this newsgroup several years ago, and I have just got hold of a book, "How to improve yoursight - simple daily drills in relaxation", by Margaret D. Corbett, ('Authorized instructor of the Bates method), published in 1953.  It talks about vision improvement by relaxation and exercise.  Has there beenany study on whether this method actually works?  If it works, is it by actually shortening the previously elongated eyeball, or by increasing the lens's ability to flatten itself in order to compensate for the too-long eyeball?Since myopia is the result of eyeball elongation, seems to me the mostlogical approach for correction is to find a way to reverse the process,i.e., shorten it somehow (preferably non-surgically).  Has there beenany recent studies on this?  Where can I find them?  I know RK works by changing the curvature of the cornea to compensate for the shape of eyeball, but if there is a way to train the muscles to shorten the eyeball back to its correct length that would be even better (Bates's idea, right?)Thanks for any information.

Perhaps you'd admit that this is an oversimplification on your part (the topicof the philosophy of science is made for them, I'm making them too) but Ithink that it also summarizes popular misconceptions of science and the business of doing science.  Biomedical research doesn't make any basic assumptions that aren't the same as any other discipline of scientificresearch.  That is, that you make empirical observations, form an hypothesisand test it.  Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than "the old Newtonian model of the world".  And I doubt that many psychologistswould appreciate being put outside this empirical "world view".  Psychologyalso has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending. >It is also important to distinguish reason from science. Science may be>reasonable, but so are many non-scientific methodologies. Aristotle reasoned>that frogs came from mud by observing one hop out of a puddle. Oversimplified, of course, but a good example.  This is an empirical observa-tion.  It was then tested, though perhaps not by Aristotle, and eventually found wanting.  In the meantime, some folk will have continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life.  There's nothing at all surprising about this, it's the way the gathering ofknowledge works.  There are probably more than a few things in my own discipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally off-base,even idiotic, to someone in the future.  These future people won't have cometo these relevations because they had suddenly gone all Zen-like and had a vision in an LSD trip.  Someone will have thought of something new and tested it.  This is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresentingscience and research can't seem to wrap their minds around.  Science is a creative process.  What I think of as factual and good research can be totallyturned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories.  Again, I think it gets down to defining what you mean by "science".  I oftendon't recognize what it is that I do, and am involved in, in the way scienceis portrayed by popular media or writings of people in the humanities.  Theyportray science as a collection of immutable facts, pronouncements of TRUTHin big gold letters.  That's silly.  Its as though we just go into the lab,turn over a stone, and come up with a mechanism for transcriptional regula-tion.  Its much more interesting than that.  It really is a very humanprocess.

On Easter he went to Grandma's and ate candy, pop - anything he wanted.  He had a seizure the next day.  She sees sensitivity to nutrasweet, sugar, colors, caffine and corn.  Withcorn she says, he gets very nervous and aggresive.  With my own daughter (age 7) , I think she is also sensitive and staysaway from those foods on her own.  She has never had gum, won't eatcandy, prefers an apple to a cookie, doesn't like chocolate and won'teven use toothpaste!!!  Her brother, on the other hand, is a junk foodaddict!  Hope this helps.

I think most American's don't care aboutanything so comlicated as that.  They just think it "looks nicer".  Ask a few of them and see what response you get.  Others still opt forcircumcision due to religious traditions and beliefs.  Some think it iseasier to clean.  Still others do it because "Daddy was".Dont' be so naive as to think American's are afraid of sexuality. My son is not circumcised, and I can vouch for the argument that it ismore difficult to keep clean than a circumcised kids'.  Not so much thatthe foreskin is difficult to pull back (it isn't) but because my sondoesn't want to wait long enough for a thorough check for smega or misplacedfeces.  So, many times it just gets a once over dab.  It worries methat he might get an infection due to his lack of cooperation.  I amsure, however, that he will be able to handle cleaning under the foreskinhimself once he is old enough.  Until, there is always the decision ateach diaper change...is this the time to clean or can we wait till nexttime.

Following the transfusion, shesuccessfully carried the next pregnancy to term, and Jake is now an active9 month-old who cannot wait to walk.     We're now thinking about having another child, but no one (includingthe OBGYN who supervised the first transfusion) really seems to knowwhether or not the transfusion process needs to be repeated for successivepregnancies.     Is there anyone in net-land who has experience with this?Thanks...Gene (and Jane and Jake)P.S. I've also posted this in misc.kids.

If you have an obvious hernia sac coming down into your scrotum, or a bulge in your groin that is brought about byincreasing intra-abdominal pressure....Sometimes is not that obvious. The hernia is small and you can only detect it by putting your finger into the inguinal canal. Whether you have a recurrent hernia, or this is related to the previousoperation, I can't tell you. The person that examined you is in  the bestposition to make that determination.Are there non-invasive ways of diagnosing a hernia? Every now and then folks write about CT scans and ultrasounds for this. But these are fartoo expensive, and unlikely to be better than a trained examining finger.====================================Howard Doyledoyle+@pitt.edu

I've been compared to the famous Robert McElwaine by some readers of Sci. Med.I didn't know how to respond since I had not seen one of your posts(just like I haven't read "The Yeast Connection").Let me just start by stating that the authors of the "Cold Fusion" papers of recent years are now in scientific exile(I believe that one has actually left the country).  Scientific fraud is rare.  I'm still not sure that if a review of the research notes of the "cold fusion scientists" actually proved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation.Your sources do not seem to be research articles.  They are more like lay texts designed to pique human interest in a subject area(just like the food combining and life extension texts).  Robert, I try to keep an open mind.But some things I just can't buy(one is taking SOD orally to prevent oxidative damage in the body).Your experiment, if conducted by readers of this news group, would prove that you are right(more ash after seed sprouting than before).  Unless you use a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature(above 600 degrees I believe), you will get organic residue in the ash.  Even the residue in commercial incinerators contains organic residue.  I remember doing this kind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in College but I couldn't find a temperature for mineral ash formation so I'm really guessing at 600 degrees F, it may actually be much higher.  The point is that no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to produce *only* a mineral ash.  They also could not measure the minerals so they could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct. Chemical reactions abound in our body, in our atmosphere, in our water and in our soil.  Are these fusion reactions?  Yes many of them do involve fusing oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics.  Do we really have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with silicon?  Not in my book Robert.Silicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet.  I've seen speculation that man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon based life-form.  I like reading science fiction, as many people do.  But I know enough about biochemistry(and nutrition) to be able(in most cases) to separate the fiction from the fact.Silicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in humans.  We have several grams of the stuff in our body.  What's it doing there?  Only the Lord knows right now.  But I will tell you what I do know about silicon and why, as you state, it helps bone healing(and it is not because silicon is transformed into calcium).Almost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective tissue(collagen and elastin).  There have been studies published which show that the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective factor against atherosclerosis(the higher the silicon content in elastin, the more resistant the elastin is to a an age-related loss of elasticity which may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as part of the ageing process in humans).For bone fracture healing, the first step is a collagen matrix into which calcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts.  A high level of silicon in the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation.  This first step in the bone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get going.Electriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming cells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in the gap(or gaps) between the ends of the broken bone.  A vitamin C deficiency(by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of defective collagen) does slow down both bone and wound healing.  Zinc is also another big player in bone and wound healing.  And so is silicon(in an  undetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not transformation of silicon to calcium).  For you to take this bone healing observation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into calcium is an interesting little trick.But Robert, I have the same problem myself when I read the lay press(and yes even some scientific papers).  Is the explanation reasonable?  Without a very good science knowledge base, you and most readers of this news group are flying blind(you have to take it on faith because you don't know any better).If the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base, I'm inclined to consider it(this usually means trying to find other sources that come to the same conclusion).  If the idea(like a candida bloom) seems to make sense to me, I tend to pursue it as long as any advice that I'm going to give isn't going to really mess somebody up.  If this makes us kindred souls Robert, then I guess I'll have to live with that label.For the physicians who have decided to read my response to Robert's interesting post, I hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric neurosurgeon last night on U.S. TV.  I can't remember the network or his name(like many nights, I was on my computer and my wife was watching TV in our Den where I have my computer setup).  This neurosurgeon takes kids with brain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he uses"unconventional"treatments(his own words).  He says that he has a 70% success rate.  The one case that I heard him discussing would normally use radiation(conventional treatment).  He was going to go in and cut.  You guys complain about the cost of the anti-fungals.  What do you think the cost difference between radiation treatment and surgery is guys? I'm going to ask you guys one more time, why blast a physician who takes the chronic sinus sufferer(like Jon) and the chronic GI sufferer(like Elaine)and tries to help them using unconventional treatments?  Treatments which do not result in death(like those that the neurosurgeon uses?).  Is it because candida blooms are not life-threatening while brain tumors are?How about quality of life guys?  May the candida demon never cross your sinus cavity or gut(if it does, you may feel differently about the issue).Marty B.

I think that Lee Lady and I are talking at cross purposes.Above, Lady seems concerned with the contrast between greatscience that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocrescience that makes smaller steps.  In most of this thread, I havebeen concerned with the difference between what is science andwhat is not. Lee Lady is correct when she asserts that the difference betweenEinstein and the average post-doc physicist is the quality oftheir thought.  But what is the difference between Einstein and agenius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughtsare scientifically screwy?  (Some would give Velikovsky orKorzybski as examples.  If you don't like these, choose yourown.)  I say it is the same as the difference between the mediocrephysicist and the mediocre proponent of qi.  Both Einstein andthe mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from thecumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong.Both Velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed todo this.  Let me approach this from a second direction.  When one is askedto review a paper for a journal or conference, there are manykinds of criticism that one can make.  One kind of criticism isthat the work is just wrong or misinformed.  Another kind ofcriticism is that the work, while technically correct, is eithernot important or not interesting.  The first difference is theone that I have been pointing to.  The second difference is theone that Lee Lady seems to be discussing. > If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit> to homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information.> But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.

I have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered scientific, what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims,not just of some of its proposed remedies.  Similarly, I suspectthat traditional Chinese medicine has many remedies that work;what it lacks (as one example) is any experiment that tests thepresence of qi.> ...

Let's face it: we cannotalways wait for an Einstein to come along and make everythingclear for us.  Sometimes those of us who are not Einstein have toplug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can. Russell

Make sure to>tell the pharmacist that you want the "Physicians' Package Insert" *NOT* theIf people are going to do this, I really wish they would tell me first.I'd be happy to go over the insert (in the PDR) with them and explaineverything.  All too many patients read the insert and panic and thenon the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drugand we are starting over again at square one.  Some of them probablydidn't even come back for followup because they didn't want to admitthey wouldn't take the drug or thought I was trying to kill them orsomething.  What people don't understand about the inserts is that theyreport every adverse side effect ever reported, without substantiatingthat the drug was responsible.  The insert is a legal document to sloughliability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was tohappen.  If patients want to have the most useful and reliable informationon a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of theAMA drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific.There are very few drugs that someone hasn't reported a death from taking.Patients don't realize that and don't usually appreciate the risksto themselves properly.  I'm sure Herman is going to "go ballistic",but so be it.  Another problem is that probably most drugs have beenreported to cause impotence.  Half the males who read that will falsely assumeit could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so willrefuse to take any drug like that.  This can be a real problem forPDR readers.  There needs to be some way of providing patients withtools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need.I am involved in a research project to do that, with migraine as thedomain.  It involves a computer system that will provide answers to questionsabout migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient.For common illnesses, such as migraine and hypertension, this may helpquite a bit.  The patient could spend as much time as needed with thecomputer and this would then not burden the physician.  Clearly,physicians in large part fail to answer all the questions patients have,as is demonstrated over and over here on the net where we get askedthings that the patients should have found out from their physicianbut didn't.  Why they didn't isn't always the physician's fault either.Sometimes the patients are afraid to ask.  They won't be as afraid toask the system, we hope.-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, andgeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon." ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The last time I got stung by a bee I experienced the same reactionthe first poster's brother did.  We went off to the doctor to see if Ishould worry about the fact that my foot was now about 3 times it's normalsize.  (And itched!!!  Ow!)  He basically said I shouldn't this time, butthat bee sting allergy was not something you tended to get aclimatized to,but were something that each time got progressively worse generally and thatnext time could be the time I go into anaphylactic shock.  Admittedly thiswas many years ago when I was young.  Since then I just make sure I don'tget stung.  I also should carry a bee sting kit with me, but I don't.  This isn't scientific or proof, but this would lead me to believe it's not adifferent reaction, just a different degree of reaction.  Allergies workthat way.  People have various reactions.  Sort of like diabetes, somepeople can get by with just monitoring their diet, others have to monitortheir diet and use insulin sometimes while others have to watch their dietlike a hawk and use insulin regularly.  I think MSG is probably similar...some people have allergic reactions toit.  Some people are allergic to fermented things and can't use soysauce...but the chinese have been using it for centuries... that doesn'tnecessarily mean that it's safe for everyone.

People with early life herniasare felt to have a congenital sack that promotes the formation of hernias.The hernias of later life may be more associated with chronic straining.  However, the risk of damage to the intestine without an operation is high enough that it ought to be repaired.  The risk of cancer is probablyno higher than the general population, but since you are near 40, it wouldbe sensible to have some sort of cancer screening, such as a flexiblesigmoidoscopy.

See the sci.skeptic FAQ (I edit it).You can diagnose some things by looking at the eyes.  Glaucoma is theClassic Example, but there are probably others.Iridology maps parts of the body onto the irises of the eyes.  Bylooking at the patterns, striations and occasional blobs in the irisesyou are supposed to be able to diagnose illnesses all over the body.The two questions to ask any alternative therapist are:1: How does it work?2: What evidence is there?The answer to question 1 takes a little knowledge of medicine toevaluate.  I don't know about iridology, but I've read a book onreflexology, which is a remarkably similar notion except that theorgans of the body are mapped onto the soles of the feet.  There aresupposed to be channels running down the body carrying information orenergy of some sort.  Anatomists have found no such structures.(Always beware the words "channel" and "energy" in any spiel put outby an alternative practitioner.)The answer to question 2 is rather simpler.  If all they have isanecdotal evidence then forget it.  Ask for referreed papers inmainstream medical journals.  Ignore any bull about the conspiracy ofrich doctors suppressing alternative practitioners.  Studies are doneand papers are published.  Some of them are even positive.The word "licensed" in the flyer is an interesting one.  Licensed bywhom?  For what?  It is quite possible that the herbology is real andrequires a license: you can kill someone by giving them the wrongplants to eat, and many plants contain very powerful drugs (Foxgloveand Willow spring to mind).  It is not clear whether the licenseextends to the iridology, and I suspect that if you ask you will betold that it means "(Licensed herbologist) and iridologist".BTW, the usual term is "herbalist".

In the extreme case, a perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all> the possible mistakes he might make that he is unable to even leave> the house.  One of the most important (and difficult) aspects of reasoningabout empirical investigation lies in understanding the context,scope, and importance of the various arguments and pieces ofevidence that are marshalled for a claim.  Some errors break theback of a piece of research, some leave a hole that needs to befilled in, and some are trivial in their importance.  It is agrave mistake to confuse these.Past snippets from this thread:>>> I doubt if Einstein used any formal methodology.  ....>> He also proposed numerous experiments which if performed would>> distinguish a universe in which special relativity holds from>> one in which it does not. ...Back to Lee Lady:> These are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and> sci.psychology.  According to these posters  "If it's not supported by> carefully designed controlled studies then it's not science."These posters are making the mistake that I have previouslycriticized of adhering to a methodological recipe.  A "carefullydesigned and controlled study" is neither always possible noralways important.  (On the other hand, if someone is proposing aremedy that supposedly alleviates a chronic medical problem, wehave enough knowledge of the errors that have plagued *this* kindof claim to ask for a "carefully designed and controlled study"to alleviate our skepticism.)Rules such as "support the hypothesis by a carefully designed andcontrolled study" are too narrow to apply to *all* investigation.I think that the requirements for particular reasoning to beconvincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that haveoccurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things.  (Toreuse the previous example, we know that conclusions fromuncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medicalproblems are notoriously problematic.)  Russell

It sells for over$100 from a California-based company.  He also plugs Vitra-Toxproducts as his chemical agents of choice: these include volcanic ash,supposedly for its electrical charge, and psyllium powder, for itsbulkiness.If anyone knows anything about colon cleansing theory, itsparticulars, or the Colema Board and related products, I'd be veryinterested to hear about research and personal experience.This article is crossposted to alt.magick as the issue touches uponfasting and cleansing through a "ritual" system of purification.-- Eli-- /-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\![wiesel@cs.yale.edu] Elisha Wiesel, Davenport College '94 Yale University!    ![wiesel@minerva.cis.yale.edu] (203) 436-1338<-School (212) 371-2756<-Home!\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------/

She has also never had a problemeating corn or corn on the cob but of course, that is usually later in the daywith a full stomach so the absorption would not be so high.

For Streptomycin, usually given intramuscularly, use a thin needle (23/24 guage) and select a spot onthe upper, outer thigh (no major nerves or blood vessels there). Clean the area with antiseptic before injection, and after. Makesure to inject deeply (a different kind of pain is felt when theneedle enters the muscle - contrasted to the 'prick' when it pierces the skin).PS: Try to go to a doctor. Self-treatment and self-injection shouldbe avoided as far as possible.

At that time he saw a gastroenterologist and has tried acid controllers (Mylanta, Tagamet), as well as a restricted diet and raising the head of his bed.  These treatments were not effective and because the damage was worsening, he opted for a surgical repair 3 months ago.  He was told there were two repair techniques that could fix the problem; a Nissen wrap and a "Hill Repair".  He opted for the "Hill Repair". He recovered very well from the surgery itself but the pain he had originally is worse and in addition he now has trouble swallowing (including saliva).The doctor now wants to do an endoscopy and has also informed him that a biopsy might be necessary if he has a pre-cancerous condition which he called "Barrett's Syndrome". If he can't avoid having reflux will he necessarily get cancer?Basically, if anyone has any information on what he should do now, I'd appreciate it.Thanks,Pat Lydon/ NetManage, Inc./ Pat@netmanage.com

Not all kidney stones have calcium and not all calcium stones are calcium-oxalate.  But the vast majority are calcium-oxalate.  Calcium is just one piece of the puzzle.  I cited that NEJM article as a way of pointing out to some of the physicians in this group that conventional wisdom is used in medicine, always has been and probably always will be.  If one uses conventional wisdom, there is a chance that you will be wrong.  As long as the error is not going to cause a lot of damage, what's the big deal(why call a physician who gives anti-fungals to sinus suffers or GI distress patients a quack?).On the kidney stone problem.  I'd want a mineral profile run in a clinical chemistry lab.  Balance is much more important than the dietary intake of calcium.  I know that you use an electrical conductance technique to measure mineral balance in the body.  I know that you don't think that the serum levels for minerals are very useful(I agree).  If I can get a good nutritional assessment lab setup where I can actually measure the tissue reserve for minerals, I'd like to do a collaborative study with you to see how your technique compares with mine.Marty B.

My OB and I decided to go for a csec.  The OB called inthe anesthisiologist (sp?) and asked him to help prep me for surgery.AFTER, watching me go through a couple contractions, the anes (or anus asI like to refer to him) said, "Well, I am off duty now." (still staringbetween my legs at that).  The OB asked to go call whomever it was whowas on duty and ask him/her how long it would take...and if it was goingto take more than a few minutes, to please stay even though he was off duty.The anes. went out, supposedly to call the on-call anes.   In a couple ofminutes the nurse came running in to tell the OB that the anes. had leftwithout even trying to get ahold of the on-call.  It was the only time during my labor that I swore.  The on-call anes. took 20 minutes to getthere.Come to find out, the anes. had only just gone off duty (about 2 minutesbefore) and technically was supposed to stay in the hospital until thenext on-call got there.  Good thing for all of us (especially him) thatit was not a critical emergency.  But boy would I love to knock thatfellow's ouchie places ...just to let him be in pain afew little minutes.I have run into "Dr. Idiots", "Mechanic Idiots", "Clerk Idiots" and "Etc.Idiots" in my time, but this fellow I would like to have words with.Deantha

Some of them are very seriouswhile others are completely benign.  Having "a few irregular beats"on an EKG could be serious depending on what those beats were andwhen they occurred, or could be of no significance.Low blood potassium levels probably predispose people with underlyingheart disease to develop arrhythmias.  Very low potassium levels areclearly dangerous, but it is not clear how much of a problemlow-end-of-normal levels are:  a lot of cardiologists seem to treatanyone with even a mildly low-normal potassium level.-- David Rindrind@enterprise.bih.harvard.edu

The clinic was open till 6:00 pm.  The receptionist went to the back and told the doctor that we were there, and came back and told us the doctor would not see us because she had someplace to go at 6:00 and did not want to be delayed here.  During the next few minutes, in response to my questions, with several trips to the back room, the receptionist told me:- the doctor was doing paperwork in the back,- the doctor would not even look at his finger to advise us on going  to the emergency room;- the doctor would not even speak to me;- she would not tell me the doctor's name, or her own name;- when asked who is in charge of the clinic, she said "I don't know."I realize that a private clinic is not the same as an emergency room, butI was quite angry at being turned away because the doctor did not want tobe bothered.  My son did get three stitches at the emergency room.  I'm still trying to find out who is in charge of that clinic so I can write them a letter.   We will certainly never set foot in that clinic again.-------------------------------------------------------------------------Mary Ryanmryan@stsci.eduSpace Telescope Science InstituteBaltimore, Maryland

As soon as you possibly can.  Thedifference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recoveryand a long, drawn-out ordeal.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  Now, your garden-varietydoctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  Generally,any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists inthese kinds of problems.  DON'T WAIT, THOUGH.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.The remainder of this information is paraphrased, without permission, froma wonderful report by New Zealand's Department of Labour (OccupationalSafety and Health Service): "Occupational Overuse Syndrome. Treatment andRehabilitation: A Practitioner's Guide".First, a glossary (or, fancy names for how you shouldn't have your hands):(note: you're likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors :)  RSI: Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kinds of injuries  OOS: Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RSI  CTD: Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RSI  WRULD: Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RSI  CTS: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (see below)  Hyperextension:  Marked bending at a joint.  Pronation: Turning the palm down.  Wrist extension: Bending the wrist up.  Supination: Turning the palm up.  Wrist flexion: Bending the wrist down.  Pinch grip: The grip used for a pencil.  Ulnar deviation: Bending the wrist towards the little finger.  Power grip: The grip used for a hammer.  Radial Deviation: Bending the wrist toward the thumb.  Abduction: Moving away from the body.  Overspanning: Opening the fingers out wide.Now then, problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffuseconditions.  Local problems are what you'd expect: specific muscles,tendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt.Diffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve musclediscomfort, pain, burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas oftenderness in muscles, although they're not necessarily "the problem."--- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Here's the theory.Normally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries whichpass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle, you restrictthe blood flow.  By the time you're exerting 50% of your full power,you're completely restricting your blood flow.Without fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run out,then they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generatesnasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause pain.Once one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve theload.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makesthings worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flow,and the cycle continues.Another by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness fromyour nerves.  They need blood too.Anyway, when you're typing too much, you're never really giving a changefor the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles neverrelax enough to let the blood through.  Stress, poor posture, and poorergonomics, only make things worse.--- Specific injuries you may have heard of:(note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  Acuteinjuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions haveless pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.)Tenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitisoccurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough tocause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheath's abilityto lubricate the tendon.  As a result, the tendon sheath thickens, getsinflamed, and you've got your problem.Tendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendoncan cause inflamation.  Eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating,and can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, moreswelling, and more pain.  "Sub-acute" tendonitis is more common, which entailsa dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worsewith repetitive activity.Carpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into yourfingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms includefeeling "pins and needles", tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensation.CTS is often confused for a diffuse condition.Adverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as 'neural tension', this is wherethe nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possiblycompressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere.AMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS disorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy (brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy).Others: for just about every part of your body, there's a fancy name fora way to injure it.  By now, you should be getting an idea of how OOSconditions occur and why.  Just be careful: many inexperienced doctorsmisdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, when in reality, youmay have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opinionbefore somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery).==4== Typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatmentThe most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reducetension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relax.If you're under a load of stress, this is doubly important.  Tune outthe world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guidingprinciple in your work: every three minutes take a three second break.EVERY THREE MINUTES, TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really, do it everythree minutes.  It's also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings,calm down, and relax.If you can't sleep, you really need to focus on this.  Rest, sleep, andrelaxation are really a big deal.There are all kinds of other treatments, of course.  Drugs can reduceinflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent badposture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengthenyour muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good postureand a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-coldcontrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say what's bestfor you.--- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines.  [I so liked the way this waswritten in the New Zealand book that I'm lifting it almost verbatim fromAppendix 10. -- dwallach]. Let your shoulders relax.. Let your elbows swing free.. Keep your wrists straight.. Pull your chin in to look down - don't flop your head forward.. Keep the hollow in the base of your spine.. Try leaning back in the chair.. Don't slouch or slump forward.. Alter your posture from time to time.. Every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backward.Set the seat height, first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  There should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees,and your thighs should not slope too much.Now, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortableto work at.  If you are short, this may be impossible.  The beest remedyis to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using afootrest.Now, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the spacebetween the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you inthe hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in thisarea.If you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaningback, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available.[Now, I diverge a little from the text]A good chair makes a big difference.  If you don't like your chair, gofind a better one.  You really want adjustments for height, back angle,back height, and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get inthe way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable armrests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a goodstore and play with all these chairs -- pick one that's right for you.In the San Francisco Bay Area, I highly recommend "Just Chairs."  Thename says it all.--- Keyboard drawers, wrist pads, and keyboard replacements:There is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For somepeople, wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However, with good posture, youshouldn't be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer yourkeyboard to be "right there".  If you drop your arms at your side and thenlift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your handswhen your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course, you want to avoidpronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist padsmay or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come andlook at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you relax.  It'soften easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders ordeviated hands.Some argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorlydesigned.  A number of replacements are available, on the market, today.Check out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail.==5== Requests for more infoClearly, the above information is incomplete.  The typing-injury archiveis incomplete.  There's always more information out there.  If you'd liketo submit something, please send me mail, and I'll gladly throw it in.If you'd like to maintain a list of products or vendors, that would bewonderful!  I'd love somebody to make a list of chair/desk vendors.  I'dlove somebody to make a list of doctors.  I'd love somebody to edit theabove sections, looking for places where I've obviously goofed.==6== ReferencesI completely rewrote the information section here, using a wonderfulguide produced in New Zealand by their Occupational Safety & HealthService, a service of their Department of Labour.

Is it worth the $100 it is currently>selling for?No, they do not work well.  My doctor started using one recently, and Ithought the concept was so amazing that I bought one too.  The thing works by reading the infrared emissions from the ear drum.The ear drum is hotter than the ear canal walls, so you have to pointthe thing very carefully.  This means tugging on the top of the earto straighten out the ear canal, then inserting the thing snugly, thenpushing a button.  Unfortunately, there are many things that can go wrong.It is almost impossible to aim the thing correctly when you do it on yourself.  I get readings which differ from each other by up to 2 degrees,and may differ from an oral thermometer by up to 2 degrees.  I talked to one of the nurses in my doctor's office recently about this,and she said she didn't like them either, for same reasons.  She did giveme some instruction on how to tug on my ear, and what correct insertionfeels like, but she said she thought it was impossible to do correctlyon one's self.  She also said that she and other nurses had complained tothe company about inaccurate readings, and that someone from the companyhad told them to take great care to clean the infrared window at the endof the probe with alcohol from time to time.  She demonstrated this priorto reading my temperature, and managed to get a reading within 0.5 degreeof the oral temperature I took at home before driving to the Dr's office.I have also noticed tha some nurses click the button, then remove theprobe immediately.  This causes wrong readings.  In my experience, youhave to leave the probe in a good 1 to 2 seconds after clicking the buttonto get a good measurement.  The nurse I talked with agreed.  I suspectthat many people don't realize this, and therefore get bad readings foryet another reason.In short, it's a great idea.  It may work for some folks, but I believeit doesn't work well for a person who wants to take his own temperature.

But before I do, I want to get a few things off my chest.  I just got blasted in e-mail for my kidney stone posts.  Kidney stones are primarily caused by diet, as is heart disease and cancer.  When I give dietary advise, it is not intended to encourage people reading this news group(or Sci. Med. Nutrition where I do most of my posting) to avoid seeing a doctor.  Nothing can be further from the truth.  Kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to be ruled out.  But once it is, diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurance.Same thing with heart disease and cancer, if you suspect that you may have a problem with one of these diseases, don't use what I'm going to tell you or what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor.  You have to go.Hopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help you change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment program(but the odds are that you will not and that's why I'm here).  When my wife detected a lump in here breast I didn't say, don't worry my vitamin E will take care of it.  Any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician, plan and simple.  If it's begnin(which most are) fine, then maybe a diet change and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring.But let me tell you right now, if you have tried diet and supplementation and another lump returns, get your butt into the doctor's office as fast as your little feet can carry you(better yet, have a mammography done on a regular basis, my wife kept putting her's off, both myself and her gynocologist told her she needed to have one done).  Her gynocologist even scheduled one, but she didn't show up(too busy running the Operating Room for the biggest Hospital in Tulsa).One more thing, I am not an orthomolecular nutritionist.  This group uses high dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease.  There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have drug actions in the body.  But you talk about flying blind, man this is really blind treatment.  No drug could ever be used as these vitamins and minerals are being used.  I'm not saying that some of this stuff couldn't be right on the money, it may well be.  But my approach to nutrition is a lot like that of Weinsier and Morgan, the two M.D's who wrote the new Clinical Nutrition textbook.  My push is the nutrient reserves and the lab tests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet changes to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you handle stress.  That's where I'm coming from folks.  Blast away if you want,I'm not going to change.  Put me in your killfile if you want, I really don't care.  I'm averaging 8-10 e-mail messages a day from people who think that I've got something important to say.  But I'm also getting hit by a few with an axe to grind.  That's life.Chromium is one of the trace elements.  It has a very limited(but very important) role in the body.  It is used to form glucose tolerance factor(GTF).  GTF is made up of chromium, nicinamide(niacin), glycine, cysteine and glutamic.  Only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to form GTF.  Some foods already have GTF(Liver, brewers or nutritional yeast,and black pepper).  When chromium is in GTF, a pretty good absorption is seen(about 20%).  But when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral chelate(chromium picolinate) it's absorption is much lower(1 to 2%, lowest for all the minerals).  I've been posting in Misc. Fitness and chromium has come up there several times as a "fat burner".  Chromium is among the least toxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really do any harm.  I wouldn't do it though.  The adequate and safe range for chromium is 50 to 200ug per day.  The average American is getting about 30ug per day from his/her diet.  Chromium levels decrease with age and many believe that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency.  I can cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in Type II diabetes but I'm not going to because for each positive one, there also seems to be a negative one as well.  I'm convinced that the problem is bioavailability.  When yeast(GTF) is used, good results are obtained but when chromium itself is used the results are usually negative.  In addition to Type II diabetes, chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and glucoma, again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is concernedSince a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease, this possible link with chromium isn't too surprising.  Glucoma is a little more interesting.  Muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin responsive glucose-driven metabolic function.  If this eye focusing activity is impaired(by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response), intraocular pressure is believed to be elevated.  In a fairly large study of 400 pts with glaucoma, the one consistent finding was a low RBC chromium. J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 10(5):536,(1991).  But this one preliminary study should not prompt people to go out and start popping chromium supplements.  For one thing, just about every older person is going to have a low RBC chromium unless they have been taking chromium suppleemnts(yeast).  Since glucoma is often found in older people, it's not too surprising that chromium was low in the RBC's.  If chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma, that would prompt some attention.  I suspect that there will be a clinical trail to check out this possible chromium link to glucoma.You could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the RBC chromium test or hair analysis.  Most clinical labs are not going to run a RBC chromium.  There are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail analysis for you, but I wouldn't use them.  There is just too much funny business going on in these unregulated labs right now.Here's Weinsier and Morgan, advise on chromium.  They do not consider chromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is available(they don't like the hair and nail analysis labs either, and they also recognize the RBC chromium is primarily a research test that is not routinely available in most clinical chemistry labs).  This has to change and as more labs run a RBC chromiuum, it will.  What then do they suggest?Make a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical response to chromium(run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium supplementation).  Once you make the diagnosis, put the patient on 200ug of CrCl3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per day.What's my advise?  Don't take chromium supplements to try to loose weight(they just do not work that way).  If you want to take them and then exercise, that would be great.  Do include yeast as part of your diet(most Americans are not getting enough chromium from their diet).  If you do have a poor glucose tolerance, ask your doctor to check your chromium status.  When he or she says, "what in the world are you talking about", just say, please get a copy of Weinsier and Morgan's new Clinical Nutrition textbook and do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose tolerance.  If you can't do that, I'll find a doctor who can, thank you very much.Marty B.

Some examples of very low cost NATURAL ANTI-cancer Remedies are listed inthe following article:                          NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES                                 A 3RD OPINION                         ( Some of these Remedies also work against AIDS. )          DISCLAIMER: This list was compiled from unorthodox sources           that have shown themselves to be reliable.  The compiler of           this list is NOT a doctor of any kind, but is exercising his           First Amendment Constitutional RIGHT of FREE SPEECH on the           subjects of his choice.           ( MOST of these Remedies can be found in ANY Grocery Store.            MOST of the rest of them can be found in ANY Health Food           Store.  What is important is HOW they are used, and what           else is EXCLUDED DURING their use. )          (1) THE 7-DAY FAST.                1st day: Eat as much fresh fruit as you want, one kind           at a time, preferably grapes.                2nd day: Eat all the vegetables you want, at least half           raw, including GARLIC; also, whole kernel corn to help scrape           clean the intestinal linings.                3rd day: Drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice           you want.  Preferably start with 16 to 32 ounces of prune           juice WITH PULP, followed by a gallon of pure (NOT from           concentrate) apple juice, then grape juice.  (Stay close to           your home bathroom.)                4th day: Eat all the UN-salted nuts (NO peanuts) and           dried fruit you want, preferably raisins and almonds (ALMONDS           CONTAIN LAETRILE.).                5th day: ONE GALLON OF LEMONADE.  Squeeze the juice from           two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled), and           add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey, (NO sugar).            Drink one glass per hour.          [EVERYone, including healthy people, should do this one day           every week, preceded by a large glass of prune juice WITH           PULP.]                6th day: Same as 5th day.                7th day: Same as 6th day.                All 7 days, eat ONLY the foods listed above for each           day, along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements,           plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want.           (2) THE GRAPE DIET.                Eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours, 8 AM to           8 PM, every day for six days.  Eat NOTHING else during the           six days, but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want.                 (3) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR.               Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (NOT apple           cider "flavored" vinegar.  Regular vinegar is HARMFUL.) in a           glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it.            Do this 3 or 4 times per day, for 3 weeks; then stop for a           week.  Repeat if desired.  Do this along with a normal           healthy diet of natural foods.  This remedy is especially           effective against those types of cancer that resemble a           FUNGUS, as well as against other kinds of fungus infections.                   (4) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH.  [Please keep an OPEN MIND.]               Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level           comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in.            Immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely           dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt           (regular salt won't work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda.                Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes, while exercising           your fingers, toes, and limbs, turning sideways and onto your           stomach, dunking your head, sitting up and laying back down,           chomping your teeth together, etc..                Among other things, the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes           the accumulated effects of X-rays, etc., as described in the           book "Born To Be Magnetic, Vol. 2", by Frances Nixon, 1973.                PRECAUTIONS: Only the ONE person using each bath should           prepare it and drain it.          For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away           from, and even out of sight of, other people.  (Your greatly           expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt           other people's fields.)  Two hours after the bath, eat at           least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures.            (The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also.)  Better yet, take           a 2-Billion-bacteria "Acidophilus" capsule, which is also an           EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF "A.I.D.S."           (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the           digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune           system).  [Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal           bacteria, it may also be a CURE for "Lyme disease".]          Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder           storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during "Major" or           "Minor Periods" as listed in the "Solunar Tables" published           bimonthly in "Field & Stream" Magazine, (because of the           measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields           present at those times).          Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year.                  (5) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES:                       For skin cancer, apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the                affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons                per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally, for                about 2 months.                        D.M.S.O. (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to                perform NORMAL cell functions.                ALMONDS (UN-blanched, UN-roasted) CONTAIN LAETRILE.                 To help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day.                 To help cure cancer, eat several OUNCES of almonds per                day.               [NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally.                 IT WILL KILL YOU!  Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY.  (Cancer                cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile                into cyanide, which then kills the cell.  This enzyme is                ALSO present in the digestive system.)]                ANTI-OXIDANTS are FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS, and include                Vitamin E, Selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most                people.), Chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day), Vitamin A                (25,000 IU per day is safe for most people.), Superoxide                Dismutase (up to 4,000,000 Units per day), Vitamin C (up                to 3000 mg. per day), and BHT (Butylated Hydroxy-               toluene), [1 to 4 capsules of BHT every night at bedtime                will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES (BOTH types),                suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes,                prevent spreading herpes to other people, but will not                cure herpes.  BHT MIGHT ALSO DO THESE THINGS AGAINST                "A.I.D.S.", which is really a form of cancer similar to                leukemia.]  (See the book "Life Extension", by Durk                Pearson and Sandy Shaw.)                HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE.  Dilute twelve(12) drops of 3%                hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably                DISTILLED) and drink it.  Do this once or twice per day,                hours before or after eating or drinking anything else.                 Apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers                several times per day.               Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good                daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants                described above.                VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective, and                much less expensive, when COMBINED together in MEGA                doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources.                Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong (100,000 Maxwell)                NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD, especially if it is pulsating on                and off.  [A strong south magnetic field is an                aphrodisiac.]  In my opinion, ALL types of ionizing-               radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with                daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-Maxwell NORTH                magnetic fields.                Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES                can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well                as most other medical problems.  Some Radionics/Psionics                Machines can even take cross-sectional X-ray-like photos                of cancer tumors, etc., with-OUT X-rays!                INTERFERON tablets.               TAHEEBO TEA, (Lapacho).                           HOMEOPATHY can cure cancer, and many other medical                problems (even drug addiction!).                50 mg. per day of CHELATED ZINC can help prevent or cure                prostate trouble.                This list is NOT exhaustive.           The above NATURAL Remedies can CURE both diagnosed AND UN-          DIAGNOSED cancers, as well as PREVENT them, and also prevent           and cure many other medical problems including heart-          diseases.  They are NOT too simple and inexpensive to work           effectively.           Besides acting on a person biologically and chemically, these           remedies, especially The 7-Day Fast and The Grape Diet, send           a strong message to one's subconscious mind, PROGRAMMING it           to CURE the cancer.           In my opinion, if a person finds out that s/he has cancer,           then s/he should promptly try at least the first 4 remedies           described above, in sequence (starting with The 7-Day Fast),           BEFORE resorting to the UN-natural and expensive mutilations           and agonies [POISON, BURN, and MUTILATE!] of orthodox cancer           treatment [organi$ed-CRIME!].                               DISCLAIMER: This list was compiled from unorthodox sources           that have shown themselves to be reliable.  The compiler of           this list is NOT a doctor of any kind, but is exercising his           First Amendment Constitutional RIGHT of FREE SPEECH on the           subjects of his choice.

There are quacks who don't treat and quacks whotreat. One's that refuse to diagnose and ones that diagnose improperly. There are lucky quacks and unlucky quacks. Smart quacks and dumb ones. There are people ahead of their time, with unprobable or unproven theoriesand rationals. There are ill-reasoned, absurd, theorists. Sometimes it's hard to tell who's who.  Reading a book of ancient jokes it seems that doctors called other doctorsquacks in Babylon. Arguments abound when there aren't any firm answers. Plenty of illnessesaren't, or can't, be diagnosed or treated. But I think it's better to argueagainst the theory, as was originally done with postings on candida a monthor so ago. Stating the facts usually works better than simply asserting anopinion about someone's competency. And you can't convince everybody. Sometimes a correct diagnosistakes years for people: they don't run into a doctor who recognizes thedisease, they haven't developed something recognizable yet, or they havesomething that no one is going to recognize, because it hasn't beendescribed yet. Sometimes they get a cure, sometimes the illness wears out,sometimes they stumble on an improper diagnosis with the right treatment,sometimes they find it's incurable.  There is no profit in a patient accepting a hopeless attitude about an illness. Unless it's a rock solid diagnosis of terminal disease it's ismore like ly that a person will find a cure if they keep looking. -Jackie-

Rather than being able to use different tools  together in a flexible, interactive system, we find ourselves spending too  much time converting between different data formats, writing throw-away  tools and I/O parsers, and worrying about how to get to a particular goal  rather than what it means to have attained it.What we need is an object-oriented scientific environment where the tools  we choose to use are integrated without being parts of a closed system,  highly interactive, and extendable (both by the addition of our own  specialized objects and by combining the available tools - graphically).   The use of such an environment should be a natural extension of our work,  requiring a very short learning phase and practically no  user-documentation.  The user should feel encouraged to explore different  possibilities, testing his/her own scientific ideas without worrying too  much about whether the system is able to cope (within reason, of course).   By building an open and object-oriented system, each user should be able  to draw upon and combine those tools necessary or conducive to a  particular task: we all need to organize and archive our data, display  results, and combine information from many different sources.Currently, the group consists of people from very different fields:  Molecular Biology, Computer Science, Physics and Astronomy, and Geography.   While many of our needs for such an environment diverge, the underlying  motivation is the same: no matter what you want to call it, we need a  system which helps rather than hinders the organization of our scientific  data and daily work.Why NeXTSTEP?What else is there?  No other system offers the same power, a totally  object-oriented developers environment, UNIX-compatibility,  highly-interactive and standardized user-interface.  With the advent of  NS486 and the expectation that NeXTSTEP will soon appear on a broad range  of hardware platforms, such a system will soon be nearly universally  available.  Classical workstation vendors (SUN, IBM, HP, and the rest) now  have little to offer, no similar tools exist for the standard X-Windows  GUI, if Apple had a system it would only run on their hardware, and the  mass-market Windows/DOS world is a developer's nightmare (either despite,  or more probably because of, OLE).In order to progress, we need an open discussion of how best to develop  such an environment.  In NeXTSTEP parlance, do we simply have to put  together a set of scientific protocols and a common API for our  "Hyper-knowledge" servers? Should be use distributed objects?  What  minimum set of tools do we need in order to start working with the  environment?  What tool-needs do we all have in common and which ones are  best developed by specialized sub-groups?  How many already existing tools  can/should be integrated into the system (e.g. Mathematica)?  Do we need  an "AVS"-like tool for data-flow manipulation?Mailing list and Anonymous ftpIn order to take part to the project or to push the discussion forewords,  you are invited to subscribe to: sci-tools@embl-heidelberg.deAll (interesting) suggestions, projects and sources will be archive and  soon available (anonymous ftp).For questions send mail to sci-tools-help@embl-heidelberg.deAcknowledgmentsThe European Molecular Biology Laboratory (Heidelberg, Germany) has  consented to provide the computer resources for a mailing list and  anonymous ftp services.Rick Hessman    <hessman@eden.uni-sw.gwdg.de>Georg Tuparev   <tuparev@embl-heidelberg.de>

Personally, I'd prefer to meet the doctor onsomething remotely resembling a condition of parity and to establish anidentity as a person who wears clothes before dropping my drawers. Ifnothing else, it minimizes the time that I have to spend in the selfconscious, ill at ease and vulnerable condition of a person with a barebottom talking to somebody who is fully clothed.

That's exactly the way many workers have describedtheir misgivings about the Human Genome Project.  If you take a rigid definition of scientific research, the mere accumulation of data is not doing science.  One of the early arguments against the project were that the resources would be better used to focus on specific genetics-related problems rather than just going off and collecting maps and sequence.  The project can't be so narrowly defined or easily described now though.

L. acidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily responsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free.  Most of the commercial yogurt sold in the U.S. has a very low L. acidophilus and L. bulgaricus count.  Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are much more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem.  Gordon R. has told me through e-mail that he gives his patients L. acidophilus and several different obligate anaerobes(which set-up shop in the colon) but he hasn't told me which ones yet.  The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative anaerobes and will set-up shop where they have access to oxygen if given a chance(mouth, anus, sinus cavity and vagina).  Having these good bacteria around will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal region or the vagina.  I have not proposed a systemic action for candida blooms.  I know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from the evil yeast blooms in the body.  I'm not ready to buy that yet.  I do believe that complications at specific sites(vagina, anal and maybe lower colon, sinus and mouth) can result from antibiotic use which removes the competing bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow unchecked.Restoring the right bacterial balance is the best way(in my opinion) to get rid of the problem.  Anti-fungals, a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin A supplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the good bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the pH to basically starve the candida out.Marty B.

The crucialthing is not to sit around just having fantasies; they aren't of any useunless they make you do some experiments.  I've known a lot of scientistswhose fantasies lead them on to creative work; usually they won't admitout loud what the fantasy was, prior to the consumption of a few beers.(Simple example: Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNAelectrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments.  He got very excited, hoping thathe'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryoticgenes.  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry outbinding assays.  The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequencethat occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome.  Unfortunately forWarren's fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present inso many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back intothe genome.  On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons weremuch elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase wasrecognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created.Other species have different sets of transposons.  Fortunately for me,Warren and I used to eat dinner at T.G.I. Fridays all the time.)>It further at least implicitly advances the position that>sciences goes "forward" (and it is not clear what this means given the>context in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rational>and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then>weeded out via the "critical function" of science.I'm not sure that it's random.  But there is no known rational mechanismfor generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses.  If you are reallyworking in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much senseof what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the bestthing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.  If they are wrong,you will find out soon enough; but at least, you will find out _something_.If you try to do experiments at random, with no prior conceptions at allin mind, you will probably get nowhere.>(Though why this critical>function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery.Unfortunately, the critical function does sometimes become hostage tonon-rational forces.  Then we get varieties of pathological science:Lysenko, Mirsky's opposition to DNA-as-gene, cold fusion, and so forth.>If experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction are>subject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally true>of the application of any "critical function" concerning replication.>This is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an "anything goes" view.)I don't agree that this follows.  In fact, this is _exactly_ the point atwhich I disagree with Feyerabend.  It is a most important part of theculture of science that one keeps one's jealousies out of the refereeingprocess.  Failures there are aplenty, but, on the whole, things work out.Another point: there are a couple of senses of the phrase ``experimentaldesign''.  I'd say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_,not design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc. Royal Soc., 1922) chose to look forbacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (Phage had previouslybeen found in locust diarrhea; Fleming probably thought runny bottom, runnynose, what the hell, it's worth a try.) but his method of looking for phagewas well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact, he found lysozyme.>True, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.  But typically it is>*not*.  Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have>resulted in some way from a dream or from one's political views simply>do not generalize well to the actual history of science.It is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs. irrational.  Perhapsyou can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried outfor perfectly rational reasons, or interesting new theories that were firstadvanced from logical grounds.  The main examples I can think of are frommodern high-energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole.-- Mark A. FulkUniversity of RochesterComputer Science Departmentfulk@cs.rochester.edu

But hadforgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here.I generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I'vefound them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sourcesthat force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is somepelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then muchworse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past(~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably dueto the endometriosis coming back.  I've tried Synarel, it reducedthe pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediatelyafter I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as theonly "real solution" to my problem.  Although I don't expect to haveany more children, I don't like the idea of having my uterus andone remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I hadthe surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggestedI get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinksthat type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still planto have children.  So basically all I'm left with is toughing outthe pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or somethingsimilar - but not aspirin, that doesn't work, and Motrin gave mehorrible gastritis a few years ago, so I'm through with it).  Infact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I takeit regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both legs) as I'll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait untilI have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takesseveral hours for it reduce the pain (it's actually quite effectiveat reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantimeI'm frequently in severe pain.The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting inbilateral radiculopathy.  I've had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs(I've had 2 of them, and don't intend to ever do that again) withnerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as towhat is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I haveseveral bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think)it is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scanwas that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but othershav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations.The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervationcompared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test,called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the"internal nerves" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is thatI sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back painis there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there,I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the painto a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9months (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I'd always resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently,and primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physicaltherapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first monthor so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier,but it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it ata lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began goingaway (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, whichcould be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don't havenearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me offtraction about 2 weeks ago.Getting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoidtaking analgesic for headaches, I really can't avoid them entirely becauseI have other pain sources, that "force" me to use them (Oh, I forgotto mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery,but I'm avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with,occassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but ata reduced capacity (I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of readingand writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can't concentrate much,I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, becausethe pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it cancause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electricshock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets badI can't really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time homeand in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, themigraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lotof migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days.I've taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me soI reduced the dosage), but I don't like the side effects (if I takemore than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I willeventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn't very helpful whenI told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptanbecomes available, I should try that.  I've tried several other medications(fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) butthey either didn't work, or I couldn't tolerate them.  So what can I do?My doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate thepain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot ofpain.  I've had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stoppedonce from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely thesuccinylcholine), and I've already had surgery several times.Anyway, the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contributeto migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.Janice Rathmann

The types of cells that vitamin A regulates are the general epithelial cells and these cell types are not the ones that function in the ear hearing process.  The hair cell nerve-like epithelial cells in the ear may respond to vitamin A during cellular differentiation(embryogenesis) but I don't know if they are still capable of responding in adults.  If they are capable of responding with new hair growth, this would be a very major breakthrough in hearing loss.  With all of the medical interest in vitamin A, it would not be too surprising if a clinical study was done using vitamin A to reverse hearing loss.  But with only a news announcement to go on(and this type of communication is notoriously bad), I can't comment on your question anymore than I already have.  If one study has been done, more will need to follow to firm up a link between vitamin A and hearing loss if there really is one.Marty B.

There has been a tendency by some on this newsgroup to "circlethe wagons" to the viewpoint that anecdotal medical evidence is worthless(maybe to counter the claims of those who are presenting anecdotal evidenceto support controversial subjects, such as the "yeast hypothesis").  Butevidence is evidence - it requires a "jury" or a process to sort it out anddetermine the truth from the junk.  Medicine must continue to strive to betterunderstand the workings of the body/mind for the purpose of alleviatingillness - anecdotal evidence is just one piece of the puzzle;  it is notworthless.  Rather, it can help focus limited resources in the right direction.Jon Noring-- Charter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.If you're dying to know what INFJ means, be brave, e-mail me, I'll send info.=============================================================================| Jon Noring          | noring@netcom.com        |                          || JKN International   | IP    : 192.100.81.100   | FRED'S GOURMET CHOCOLATE || 1312 Carlton Place  | Phone : (510) 294-8153   | CHIPS - World's Best!    || Livermore, CA 94550 | V-Mail: (510) 417-4101   |                          |=============================================================================Who are you?

If thisis what it is, she'll probably get used to it.  It would keep me upand drive me nuts too, but nowadays, I have to plug both my ears withmy fingers to check to see if they are ringing.  Usually they are, butyou get so used to it, it just gets tuned out.  Yes, this is what I'veread about it... not just from my own personal experience.>Does anyone know of any treatments for this?

It eventuallybecomes unconscious.The doc also said it could be caused by diet (ie: too much caffeine)and stress, but I haven't changed my lifestyle much, and it just comesand goes (it is always there somewhat, but now I rarely notice it whenit really "kicks in").Also, it doesn't necessarily mean there is any hearing loss, eithercaused by it or causing it.  I had an ENT (ear/nose/throat) exam, andpassed.  In fact, my hearing is quite good considering I don't take asgood of care of my hearing as I should.Her reaction is normal.  If it is tinnitus, chances are good she'llbegin to not even notice it.  This info is taken mostly from a few "experts", my own experience, andsome readings (sorry, it was a few years back and don't have anyspecifics handy).JT

Somehow I've managed to delete my vitamin A post from my text file.  Gordon R. had promised to send it back to me but he's pretty mad at me right now so I'll just retype it.Since digging through all my references is very time consuming(took me all day for that PMS post), I'm not going to cite any references(Gordon R. has them).  I'm going to include some of the material from Weinsier and Morgan's new Nutrition textbook(which was not in my original material) to point out that what I'm going to say has some support in the medical community.Diet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very, very long time.  Protein has always had the biggest role in infection and I've already covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection.Now I'm going to hit what I consider to be the most important nutrient in the U.S. as far as infection is concerned(vitamin A).When vitamin A was originally discovered, it was commonly referred to as the anti-infection vitamin.  Many people(Linus Pauling being one) have decided to take this title away from vitamin A and give it to vitamin C(which I've already covered).  Big mistake(in my opinion).  Vitamin A is also getting a reputation as an anti-cancer vitamin(with good reason).The NCI currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if vitamin A can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well.  It's role in both cancer and infection is almost identical(but not quite).Vitamin A comes in two completely different forms(retinol and beta-carotene).  Retinol is the animal form and it's toxic, beta-carotene is the plant form and it's completely nontoxic.  Both retinol and beta-carotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present(60-80%).  The liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other tissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein(RBP).  A normal human adult liver should have 500,000IU to 1,000,000IU of retinol stored.  We are born with 10,000IU in our liver.  U.S. autopsy has shown that about 30% of Americans die with the same(or less) amount of vitamin A as they were born with.  If you don't believe that nutritional reserves(like that of retinol in the liver) are important, then this low vitamin A reserve is not going to affect you.  But if you believe(like I do) that the nutrient reserves are important, then there is a problem with vitamin A in the U.S.The U.S. RDA for vitamin A in an adult male is 1,000 RE or 5,000IU of vitamin A.  For adult feamles its 800 RE or 4,000IU of vitamin A.  Diet surveys show that most Americans are getting this amount of vitamin A(either retinol or Beta-carotene) from their diet.  But the NRC(National Research Council) was going to release a new RDA table in 1985 that had the RDA for both vitamin A and vitamin C raised(C to 90mg per day and A to 7,500IU per day for adult males).  That report and it's recommendations was killed.  Why? Concern over the increasing supplementation was the main reason.  RDAs are set to prevent clinical disease, not to keep nutrient reserves full.  Many scientist in the U.S. feel that the time has come to move away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move towards the promotion of optimum health concept, especially since we have some very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely important during periods of stress.  The nutritonal concervatives won that battle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the 1989 RDA list which lowered the RDA for several nutrients and moved the dietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the 1940's(get enough to prevent clinical pathology, but not enough to fill the reserves).We know from autopsy that only about 10% of Americans have a liver with a normal vitamin A reserve(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU).  I preach nutrient reserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patients.But for vitamin A, only a liver biopsy(or autopsy data) will tell you how much somebody has stored.  We can tell very easily if someone has overfilled his or her liver with vitamin A by measuring the serium retinol level(levels above 450ug/dl are highly suggestive that you have filled your liver with vitamin A and it's time to stop taking retinol).  The normal range of serum retinol will be 20-100ug/dl.  Hypervitaminosis A is diagnosed with a serum retinol level of 2,000ug/dl or higher(Interpretation of Diagnostic Test, Wallach, M.D., a Little Brown Series book).  This level of vitamin A in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to vitamin A toxicity.  Weinsier and Morgan take a much more conservative approach to vitamin A toxicity than does Wallach, as you will see later in this post.  Between 450ug/dl and 2,000ug/dl you should have plenty of warning that it's time to eliminate the retinol from your diet(headache, redness of the skin, hair loss, joint pain).I tell all my students that will use vitamin A in their practice that they had better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear signs that the liver is full.  You will never really know if the patient needs the vitamin A(because you can not measure the pool in liver) but you will always know when it's time to stop(just like in those vitamin A for PMS studies).Beta-carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will never have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta-carotene to retinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down(stops in the liver and slows down in the gut) when your liver is full of retinol.  But taking Beta-carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to fill the liver up(I've seen estimates of 20-30 years) if you are in the 30% that only has as much as you were born with in your liver(10,000IU).  One other problem with beta-carotene, if you have a zinc deficit, you will not convert as much beta-carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the enxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc.  In addition, the release of retinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will cause a vitamin A deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin A.Now what does vitamin A do in cancer and infection protection?  The body uses vitamin A(retinol) for many different things.  Vision(the first to be nailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology) uses the aldehyde(retinal) and alcohol(retinol) form of vitamin A.  Reproduction uses the retinol form  and some retinal.  Infection and cancer protection uses retinoic acid.  How do you convert retinol(which your white blood cells and the mucosal cells get from blood) to retinoic acid?  You use enzymes, one of which requires vitamin C(this is why Pauling has tried to pull the title of anti-infection vitamin away from vitamin A).  Vitamin C does play a role in infection(interferon production for example) but it's biggest role is the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid.  If you increase your intake of vitamin C, you will increase your formation of retinoic acid.  But retinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol(as retinal can) and once it's formed, it's used and then lost to the body.  This is why the 1985 NRC group wanted to increase both vitamin C and vitamin A RDA's.Most people taking large amounts of vitamin C really think that they are helping themselves.  If they don't have much vitamin A in their liver and they are not also increasing their intake of vitamin A, they actually do themselves more harm than good.Retinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formation.In the mucus membrane, it is the main factor in promoting good mucus production and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from entering the blood system.  The mucus membrane is referred to as the "first line" defense against infection.  For cancer, retinoic acid has been shown to act as a cell brake(it counteracts the effect of cell promoters which stimulate cells to divide).  Cancer has two distinct steps, DNA alteration and cell promotion.  For cells that normally divide all the time, promoters are not that important.  But for lung and breast tissue which does not normally divide, promoters are real important in the malignant process.This is the major reason why the NCI has so many different clinical trials in progress using retinol and/or beta-carotene.Chronic infection(irritation) of the mucus membranes is a signal that vitamin A may not be adequate.  I tell my students that any patient who walks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be worked up for vitamin A(along with the other factors that medicine already has on it's list of causes for chronic infection).  I drive this home in my course at the Osteopathic College in Tulsa, when I teach at the allopathic medical school in Tulsa(OU's branch campus) and when I give CME lectures.Dark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin A status since night vision is impacted when liver reverves drop to 50,000IU of retinol.  The serum level of retinol can also be used, but it does not drop until liver reserves drop below 10,000 to 20,000IU.  Asking a patient if they have trouble seeing at night is a good initial screen(if cataracts are ruled out).  In one study done on U.S. Spanish-Americans where serum retinol levels were measured, 25% of the sample population had a serum retinol level below 20ug/dl.As more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of the U.S. that have had a history of high infection rates, we will probably see a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low serum retinol levels.What do Weinsier and Morgan have to say about vitamin A?  Here are excerptsfrom their book:Vitamin A functions in vision in the forrm of retinol, it is necessay for growth and differentation of epithelial tissue, and is required for reproduction, embryonic development, and bone growth.  Protein-calorie malnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption, transport, and metabolism of vitamin A.  Retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid, which has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not in reproduction or vision.  The most common procedure to evaluate vitamin A status is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum.  The normal range for vitamin A content for a child is 20 to 90ug/dl.  Lower values are indicators of deficiency or depleted body stores.  Serum levels greater than 100ug/dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin A.  Dark adaptation tests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to perform on young children.  Rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to vitamin A deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state.  The bronchorespiratory tract, skin, genitourinary system, gastrointestinal tract and sweat glands are adversely affected.  A daily intake of more than 7.5mg(about 37,000IU) of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts over 20mg(100,000IU) can result in a dry and itching skin, desquamation, erythematous dermatitis, hair loss, joint pain, chapped lips, hyperostois(bony depositis), headaches, anorexia, edema and fatigue.  They recommend 30mg of retinol via IM injection in children for vitamin A deficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults.  Their toxic serum retinol level is very conservative.  I recommend that my students try 25,000IU in adults that are having problems with chronic infection.  They have to rule out a zinc deficit first by getting an RBC zinc run(or if their clinical lab can't run it, I tell them to do what Weinsier and Morgan suggest, give them the zinc along with the vitamin A.  At 25,000IU per day, toxicity should not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the patient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol.Both Elaine and Jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin A.Recall that the PMS papers were using 100,000IU to 200,000IU of vitamin A.I don't suggest that my students use these high doses.  If you wanted to fill the liver up fast(as part of a clinical trial) and were monitoring the serum retinol level, then you would be okay.  But my knowledge of the vitamin A literature suggests to me that 25,000IU for patients with a demonstrated vitamin A deficit(dark adapatation test or serum retinol) will provide a good and steady improvement(as long as zinc and vitamin C status are good) without having to worry about toxicity.  If they want to get more agressive, fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol.  But vitamin A(retinol) should never be given in high dose to women who could become pregnant since vitamin A shows teratogenicity towards the human fetus.  The dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is 18,000IU of retinol per day.  Beta-carotene will never have this effect on the human fetus.Could just taking Beta-carotene instead of retinol supplements help?  Yes but the effect will take a long time to develop.  My advise is to use retinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta-carotene to keep it full.  Vitamin A is probably one nutrient that is better off left to prescription by doctors.  But when we have the M.D.'s in this newsgroup jumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin A supplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and GI distress, I think that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin A in the OTC market but require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general public about the dangers of vitamin A supplementation.Marty B.

Same circumstance, same onset symptoms, same cafergot uselessness, same duration.  In fact, of all the peopleI know who have migraines, none have been so similar.  There is sucha wide variation between people with respect to what causes theirheadaches, that I generally don't bother sharing what I've learnedabout mine, but since ours seem to be alike, here are my observations.I don't think it's heat, per se (I've had more in winter than summer).Dehydration could conceivably figure, though.  Try tanking up beforeplaying rather than after.Being in shape doesn't seem to help me much, either.I've identified four factors that do make a difference (listed in descending order of importance):1) Heavy exercise2) Sleep deprivation3) Fasting(e.g., skipped breakfast)4) Physical trauma(e.g., head bonk)Heavy exercise has preceded all of my post-adolescent migraines, but I don't get migraines after every heavy exercise session.  One or more of the other factors *must* be present (usually #2).  Since I discovered this, I've been nearly migraine-free -- relapsing only once every two or three years when I get cocky ("It's been so long, maybe I just don't get them anymore") and stop being careful.Hope this is helpful.John.

The main problem is the side effects of these. So far she has been prescribed Prozac, Aurorix, and tryptanol all with different but unbearable side effects.The Prozac gave very bad anxiety/jitters and insomina, it was impossible to sit still for more than a minute or so.The Aurorix whilst having a calming effect, all feelings were lost and the body co-ordination was similar to a drunken person. Her brain was clouded over.The tryptanol gave tremors in the legs and panic attacks along with unco- ordination occurred.

(To>reuse the previous example, we know that conclusions from>uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical>problems are notoriously problematic.)  Okay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees of certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain treatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even if uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement thata treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope forfrom investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support.In this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as crediblebut to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who arequalified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.SECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.  I come to this dispute about what science is  not only as amathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (andoccasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Muchof the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized asinformal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For yearsnow I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists tojust take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some ofthe videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not forthe purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at theNLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information fromsubjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be ofscientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the*questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientificinvestigation.Over and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  "If thishasn't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empiricalresearch then it can't be of any interest to us."  To me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme "There've got tobe controlled studies" position is an NLP technique called the FastPhobia/Trauma Cure.Simple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world's most important psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that it doesn't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell when someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple visualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim thatit can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence isuseful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentiallya variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioraltherapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once(or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  Theprocess doesn't need to be repeated and the subject doesn't need topractice it over again at home.Now to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure. (Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)  Take someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15 minutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to the balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term follow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case, there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best of my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed after holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was donewith a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17thfloor of my building and having a large balcony.)  The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not tomake this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome studywill be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners, many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill afford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because the whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they're not part of thescientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain from scientific acceptance.) The Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical psychology establishment is still saying "We don't have any way of knowing that it's effective."  These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate as anyone could want, of course, but they say  "Why should I prove your theory?"  and  "The burden of proof is on the one making the claim."  One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't been described in a scientific journal.  (It's described in a number of books and I've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much detail as I'm capable of.)  Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with favorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because it's adoctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.To me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.  This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about "doctrinnaire" attitudes about science.  Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.  If so, I apologize.  --In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet

Quite coincidentally [actually this is what got me wanted to seethe movie again] I watched a segment on the otherwise awful _How'dThey Do That?_ dealing with a disease researcher at the CDC's toplab.  There was description of the elaborate security measures takenso that building will never be "cracked" so to speak by man ornature (short of deliberate bombing from the air, perhaps).  Andthe researchers used "spacesuits" similar to that in the film.I'm curious what people think about this film -- short of "silly".Is such a facility technically feasible today?

A not-overly critical but still useful overview of 32alternative health therapies.]  ...the Russian engineer Semyon Kirlian and his wife Valentina during the  1950s.  Using alternating currents of high frequency to 'illuminate'  their subjects, they photographed them.  They found that if an object  was a good conductor (such as a metal) the picture showed only its  surface, while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner  structure of the object even if it were optically opaque.  They found  too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead  and living objects.  Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones  were subject to changes.  The object's life activity was also visible in  highly variable colour patterns.  High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in  the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up  seriously.  Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips at  Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs and  others have been produced in Brazil, Austria and Germany.  Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around people's  fingers, notably around those of healers who are concentrating on  healing someone.  Normally, blue and white rays emanate from the fingers  but, when a subject becomes angry or excited, the aura turns red and  spotty.  The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose  diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method.  They argue that  in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person  isn't actually ill but is about to be.  They claim to be able to  foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase.  But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is  the phantom effect.  During high frequency photography of a leaf from  which a part had been cut, the photograph gave a complete picture of the  leaf with the removed part showing up faintly.  This is extremely  important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can 'see'  the legs of amputees as if they were still there.  The important thing  about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern  can't possibly represent a secondary phenomenon -- or the field would  vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished.  The energy grid  contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than  the actual object itself.  [...]  Kirlian photography has shown how water mentally 'charged' by a healer  has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water...From the incredulous side: [MacRobert, Alan, "Reality shopping; aconsumer's guide to new age hokum.", _Whole Earth Review_, Autumn 1986,vNON4 p4(11).  An excellent article providing common-sense guidelines forevaluating paranormal claims, and some of the author's favorite examplesof hokum.]  The crank usually works in isolation from everyone else in his field of  study, making grand discoveries in his basement.  Many paranormal  movements can be traced back to such people -- Kirlian photography, for  instance.  If you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will  emit glowing sparks, common knowledge to electrical workers and  hobbyists for a century.  It took a lone basement crank to declare that  the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura.  In fact, Kirlian  photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists John O.  Pehek, Harry J. Kyler, and David L. Faust, who reported their findings  in the October 15, 1976, issue of Science.  Their conclusion: The  variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on  the surface of the body and not to mysterious "auras" or even  necessarily to changes in mood or mental state.  Nevertheless,  television shows, magazines, and books (many by famous  parapsychologists) continue to promote Kirlian photography as proof of  the unknown.-- Peter Kaminskikaminski@netcom.com

I would appreciate any comments about this and other'new' technology for hearing aids.The ReSound system was developed on the basis of some research at AT&T andappears to take a different approach from other aids. It appears to me thata new 'programmable' aid like the Widex just uses a more flexible (andprogrammable) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts ofthe spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and helpout in 'noisy' situations.The major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides thespectrum into low and high frequencies (splitting point is programmable),apparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found inthe low frequencies, while the important consonant information(unfortunately for me) is in the high frequencies. The two bands then aretreated with different compression schemes which are programable. They havealso developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call'abnormal growth of loudness'.This latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience, though Ithink the phrase is missleading. What appears to be the case is that as youexceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss, the deficitbecomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reachthe 'too loud' point the sensitivity curves appear to converge.  This meansthat if you just boost all sound levels, you are overloading at the highend for people with hearing losses. Hence what you want is progressivelyless amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point.You want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentiallydifferently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum (speciallyfor someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then fallsoff a cliff).Aids with simple compressors don't descriminate between energy in the lowand high frequencies and can therefor 'compress' useful high frequencyinformation because of high volume of low frequency components.Particularly impressive was the ReSound performance with whispered speechand in simulated restaurant noise situations. -Rich Haller <rhaller@ns.uoregon.edu>   University of Oregon, Eugene, OR,USA

Results of their researchwill be reported in the May issue of the scientific journal,Radiology.   Using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)called magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a research team ledby Brian D. Ross, M.D., D. Phil., conducted a study on 21 elderlypatients who were believed to be suffering from some form ofdementia. The exams used standard MRI equipment fitted with specialsoftware developed at HMRI called Clinical Proton MRS.  ClinicalProton MRS is easily applied, giving doctors confirmatory diagnosesin less than 30 minutes.  An automated version of Clinical ProtonMRS called Proton Brain Examination (PROBE) reduces the examinationtime yet further, providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 10minutes.  By comparison, the current "standard of care" in testingfor Alzheimer's disease calls for lengthy memory function andneuropsychological tests, which can be very upsetting to thepatient, are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy.   In addition to Alzheimer's disease, the new Clinical Proton MRSexam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias, includingAIDS-related dementia, Parkinson's disease and Huntington'sdisease.   "We've developed a simple test which can be administered quicklyand relatively inexpensively using existing MRI equipment fittedwith either the MRS or PROBE software," said Dr. Ross, adding,"this will help physicians to diagnose Alzheimer's earlier andintervene with therapeutics before the progression of the diseasecauses further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain."   Dr. Ross and his HMRI team measured a family of chemicals in thebrain known as inositols, and myo-inositol (MI) acted as a markerin the study.  In comparison to healthy patients, those diagnosedwith Alzheimer's showed a 22 percent increase in MI, while theirlevel of another chemical called N-acetylaspartate (NAA) wassignificantly lower, indicating a loss of brain-stimulating neuronsbelieved to be associated with the progression of the disease.   Current drug therapy for Alzheimer's disease is widelyconsidered to be inadequate.  This is attributable, Dr. Rossbelieves, to the theory that Alzheimer's is caused by aninterruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine tothe nerve cells. This belief has been adhered to over the last 15years, and consequently, most drugs to treat Alzheimer's were basedon the changing receptors for acetylcholine.   "Physicians have a real need for a test to differentiateAlzheimer's from other dementias, to provide the patient and his orher family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatmentprotocols for the treatment of this disease.  For this reason, weconsider this test a major advancement in medicine," said BruceMiller, M.D., a noted neurologist at Harbor-UCLA, MRS researcherand a co-author of the study.   Other members of the HMRI research team included Rex A. Moats,Ph.D., Truda Shonk, B.S., Thomas Ernst, Ph.D., and Suzanne Woolley,R.N.  The PROBE software can be fitted on the approximately 1,200General Electric MRI units currently in use in the United States,and will be configured for other manufacturers' MRI units soon.

Q & A on Alzheimer's Disease:   What is Alzheimer's disease and how is it caused?   Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable degenerative disease ofthe brain first described in 1906 by the German neuropathologistAlois Alzheimer.  As the disease progresses, it leads to loss ofmemory and mental functioning, followed by changes in personality,loss of control of bodily functions, and, eventually, death.   How many people does it affect?   Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 4 million adults inthe United States and is the fourth leading cause of death, takingapproximately 100,000 lives each year.  While Alzheimer'sdebilitates its victims, it is equally devastating, bothemotionally and financially, for patients' families.  AD is themost common cause of dementia in adults.  Symptoms worsen everyyear, and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset.   What are its signs and symptoms?   Although the cause of AD is not known, two risk factors havebeen identified: advanced age and genetic predisposition.  The riskof developing AD is less than one percent before the age of 50yars old, but increases steeply in each successive decade of lifeto reach 30 percent by the age of 90.  In patients with familialAD, immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance ofdeveloping AD.  One of its first symptoms is severe "forgetfulness"caused by short-term memory loss.  Dr. Herman Weinreb of the Schoolof Medicine at New York University says "whether forgetfulness isa serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree" andsuggests the following criteria:   -- Forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is      normal.   -- Forgetting the name of a loved one is serious.   -- Forgetting where you left your keys is normal.   -- Forgetting how to get home is serious.   Doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should beevaluated in order to rule out Alzheimer's disease and other formsof dementia. -30---Canada Remote Systems - Toronto, Ontario416-629-7000/629-7044

All the clamor over laetril resulted in the NCI spending quite a bit of money on clinical trials which proved(to me anyway) that laetril was ineffective against cancer.  A physician who continued to use it, when better, more effective, treatments are available, may deserve to be called a quack.  Anti-fungals are in a different class.  The big question seems to be is it reasonable to use them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that *could* be due to candida blooms following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics?  Gorden Rubenfeld, through e-mail, has assured me that most physicians recognize the chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic use and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with *good* bacteria to restore competetion for candida in the body.  I do not believe that this is yet a standard part of medical practice.  He deals with critical care patients where fungal infection(systemic) is a real problem and just because he tries to keep *good* bacteria in his patients does not mean that all physicians do this.  I think that aspergillis is more likely to be found in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida.  Women have been known for a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and not give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams.  Since candida colonizes primarily in the ano-rectal area, GI symptoms should be more common than vaginal problems after broad-spectrum antibiotic use.The problem we have here David is proof that GI discomfort can be caused by a candida bloom.  The arguement is that without proof, no action is warrented.Medicine has not, and probalby never will be, practiced this way.  There has always been the use of conventional wisdom.  A very good example is kidney stones.  Conventional wisdom(because clinical trails have not been done to come up with an effective prevention), was that restricitng the intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming.  Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to breakdown the stone once it formed.  Through the recent New England J of Medicine article, we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong, increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is restricting calcium intake.The conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to be reinnoculated with *good* bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy.If it makes sense for livestock, why doesn't it make sense for humans David?  We are not talking about a dangerous treatment(unless you consider yogurt dangerous).  If this were a standard part of medical practice, as Gordon R. says it is, then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast infections should decline.Marty B.

Moore et al. says that gp160 in a baculovirus expression  system does not bind strongly to the CD4 receptor, and that this  recombinant gp160 does not stimulate the same antibodies as the  HIV-1 virus does in natural infection.  But vaccination with  recombinant gp160 in patients infected with HIV-1 broadens HIV-1  specific envelope-directed immune responses, including  crossreactive antibodies to gp160 epitopes and CD4 and CD8  cytotoxic T-cell responses.  Volvovitz and Smith claim that they  never intended their gp160 molecule to be identical to the native protein.  Antibody responses against native HIV-1 proteins,  including the types described by Moore et al., exist in nearly  all AIDS patients but do not prevent HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 42Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993progression of HIV disease.  In addition, the binding of gp120 or gp120-antibody complexes to  CD4 has been shown to interfere with antigen specific activation  of CD4 cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro, which  may contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV infection.  The absence of CD4 binding by the MicroGeneSys gp160 vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added safety feature.  Phase I studies have  demonstrated stable CD4 counts, stimulation of cytotoxic T cells, and the suggestion of restoration of immune function.  Based on  these and other clinical results, MicroGeneSys gp160 was chosen  by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden for the  first phase III vaccine therapy studies, conclude Volvovitz and  Smith. ==================================================================    "HIV-1 Infection: Breast Milk and HIV-1 Transmission" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 930  (Mok, Jacqueline)      There are still more questions than answers regarding  HIV-1-positive women breastfeeding their babies, writes  Jacqueline Mok of the Lancet.  The anti-infective properties of  milk are well documented.  While the numbers of leukocytes,  concentrations of lactoferrin and IgA, and lymphocyte mitogenic  activity decline sharply during the first two to three months of  lactation to barely detectable levels, lactoferrin and IgA then  increase from three to twelve months, with 90 percent of total  IgA in milk being secretory IgA.  Breastfeeding protects infants  against gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses, in both  normal and uninfected children born to HIV-positive mothers.  The Italian National Registry of AIDS discovered that breastfed HIV-1 infected children had a longer median incubation time (19 months) than bottlefed infants (9.7 months).  Breastfed children also had a slower progression to AIDS.  There is no agreement on which  antibodies offer protection against HIV-1 infection.  Studies of  the biological properties of milk from 15 HIV-1 infected women  showed the presence of IgG and IgA antibodies against envelope  glycoproteins, as well as IgA antibodies against core antigens.   Binding of HIV-1 to the CD4 receptor can be inhibited by a human  milk factor.  In the developing world, where infectious disease  and malnutrition contribute significantly to infant mortality,  breast milk is still the best food for infants, regardless of the mother's HIV status.  Transmission might be restricted by  breastfeeding after colostrum and early milk have been expressed  and discarded.  The possibility remains that breast milk could  protect the infant who is already infected with HIV at birth and  may even delay progression to AIDS, concludes Mok. ==================================================================    "Absence of HIV Transmission From an Infected Dentist to His Patients" Journal of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol. 269,  No. 14, P. 1802  (Dickinson, Gordon M. et al.)      If universal precautions are practiced, the risk of HIV  transmission from dentist to patient appears to be infinitesimal, write Gordon M. Dickinson HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 43Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993et al. of the University of Miami  School of Medicine in Miami, Fla.  The researchers contacted all  patients treated by a dentist with AIDS and attempts were made to contact all patients for HIV testing.  Living patients with newly detected HIV infection were interviewed, and DNA sequence  analysis was performed to compare genetic relatedness of their  HIV to that of the dentist.  Death certificates were obtained for deceased patients, and the medical records of those with  diagnoses suggestive of HIV disease or drug abuse and those dying under the age of 50 years were examined in detail.  There were  1,192 patients who had undergone 9,267 procedures, of whom 124  were deceased.  An examination of the death certificates of  patients identified five who had died with HIV infection, all of  whom were either homosexuals or IV-drug users.  The researchers  were able to detect 962 of the remaining 1,048 patients, and 900  agreed to be tested.  HIV infection was reported in five of the  900 patients, including four who had clear evidence of risk  factors for the disease.  One patient who had only a single  evaluation by the dentist denied high-risk behavior.  Comparative DNA sequence analysis showed that the viruses from the dentists  and these five patients were not closely related.  The study  suggests the potential for HIV transmission from a general  dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting in which  universal precautions are strictly observed, conclude Dickinson  et al.        ================================================================                                   April 22, 1993        ================================================================   "AIDS Patients are Susceptible to Recurrences of TB, Study Says" Washington Post (04/22/93), P. A13      Tuberculosis can strike AIDS patients more than once, which makes the resurging health hazard harder to control, according to a  study published in today's New England Journal of Medicine.   People who contract TB usually develop an immunity that protects  them if they are exposed to the bacteria again.  But a person  whose immune system is depleted may not be able to fight off a  new TB infection, doctors found.  Peter M. Small of the Howard  Hughes Medical Institute at Stanford University, director of the  study, said that in order to protect against reinfection, it may  be necessary for some people to use TB medicines permanently.   The study examined the genetic makeup of TB bacteria and how the  germs changed over time in 17 patients at Kings County Hospital  in New York. ================================================================    "HIV-1 Infection: Breast Milk and HIV-1 Transmission" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 930  (Mok, Jacqueline)      There are still more questions than answers regarding  HIV-1-positive women breastfeeding their babies, writes  Jacqueline Mok of the Lancet.  The anti-infective properties of  milk are well documented.  While the numbers of HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 44Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993leukocytes,  concentrations of lactoferrin and IgA, and lymphocyte mitogenic  activity decline sharply during the first two to three months of  lactation to barely detectable levels, lactoferrin and IgA then  increase from three to twelve months, with 90 percent of total  IgA in milk being secretory IgA.  Breastfeeding protects infants  against gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses, in both  normal and uninfected children born to HIV-positive mothers.  The Italian National Registry of AIDS discovered that breastfed HIV-1 infected children had a longer median incubation time (19 months) than bottlefed infants (9.7 months).  Breastfed children also had a slower progression to AIDS.  There is no agreement on which  antibodies offer protection against HIV-1 infection.  Studies of  the biological properties of milk from 15 HIV-1 infected women  showed the presence of IgG and IgA antibodies against envelope  glycoproteins, as well as IgA antibodies against core antigens.   Binding of HIV-1 to the CD4 receptor can be inhibited by a human  milk factor.  In the developing world, where infectious disease  and malnutrition contribute significantly to infant mortality,  breast milk is still the best food for infants, regardless of the mother's HIV status.  Transmission might be restricted by  breastfeeding after colostrum and early milk have been expressed  and discarded.  The possibility remains that breast milk could  protect the infant who is already infected with HIV at birth and  may even delay progression to AIDS, concludes Mok. ================================================================   "HIV and the Aetiology of AIDS" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 957  (Duesberg, Peter)      Because there is no proof that HIV is the cause of AIDS, the  hypothesis that drug use leads to AIDS will hopefully become a  hindrance to the physiologically (AZT) and psychologically  (positive AIDS test) toxic public health initiatives, writes  Peter Duesberg of the University of California--Berkeley.  In the Lancet's March 13 issue, Schechter et al. call Duesberg's  hypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and  AZT lead to AIDS, "a hindrance to public health initiatives."   However, their hypothesis that HIV is the cause of AIDS has not  attained any public health benefits.  The U.S. government spends  $4 billion annually, but no vaccine, no therapy, no prevention,  and no AIDS control have resulted from work on this hypothesis.   Schechter et al. conclude that HIV has a key role in CD4  depletion and AIDS based on epidemiological correlations with  antibodies against HIV and with self reported recreational drug  use among homosexuals from Vancouver.  However, their survey  neglects to disprove Duesberg's drug-AIDS hypothesis, because it  does not provide controls--i.e., confirmed drug-free AIDS  cases--and because it does not quantify drug use and ignores AZT  use altogether.  To refute Duesberg's hypothesis Schechter would  have to produce a controlled study demonstrating that over a  period of up to 10 years HIV-positive patients who use  recreational drugs or AZT or both have the same AIDS risks as  positives who do not do so.  The 10 year period is claimed by  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993proponents of the HIV hypothesis to be the time needed for HIV to cause AIDS.  Alternatively, they could show that HIV-free  individuals who have used drugs for 10 years never get  AIDS-defining illnesses, concludes Duesberg. ================================================================   "Rapid Decline of CD4+ Cells After IFNa Treatment in HIV-1  Infection" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 959   (Vento, Sandro et al.)      Interferon (IFN), which induces autoantibodies and autoimmune  diseases in some settings, may hasten CD4 T-cell loss in some  HIV-1 infected individuals through the amplification of harmful  "autoimmune" reactions, write Sandro Vento et al. of the A.  Pugliese Hospital in Catanzaro, Italy.  The researchers report  three asymptomatic HIV-1 infected individuals with hepatitis C  Virus related chronic active hepatitis (CAH) who had a rapid,  profound decline of CD4 cells after IFN.  All three patients  throughout the observation were consistently negative for serum  HIV p24 antigen and had circulating antibodies to p24.  Sera from all three patients, obtained at the end of IFN treatment and  testing in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, contained high  titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the  aminoterminal of the beta chain of all human HLA class II  antigens, homologous to a sequence located in the carboxy  terminus of HIV-1 gp41.  These autoantibodies, which also  recognize "native" class II molecules and may contribute to the  elimination of CD4 T cells "in vivo", were at low tires (50-100)  in all three patients six months after stopping IFN.  Such  autoantibodies were not detected in 28 other patients with HIV  infection and HCV related CAH treated with IFN and who did not  experience CD4 T-cell loss in some HIV-1 infected individuals  through the amplification of harmful "autoimmune" reactions.  The subjects had A1; B8; DR3; and B35, DR1 HLA antigen combinations  which are linked with a more rapid fall in CD4 cell counts and  clinical progression of HIV-1 disease.  IFN can induce a very  rapid decline of CD4 cells and should be used cautiously in  patients with these HLA haplotypes, the researchers conclude.        ================================================================                                   April 23, 1993        ================================================================    "TB Makes a Comeback" State Government News (04/93) Vol. 36, No. 4, P. 6   (Voit, William and Knapp, Elaine S.)      Although tuberculosis was once believed to be eliminated in the  United States, it is emerging again among the homeless, AIDS  patients, immigrants, minorities, and prisoners.  Dr. Lee B.  Reichman, professor of medicine at the University of New Jersey  Medical School and president of the American Lung Association,  said, "Right now, it's a big city problem, but potentially it's  everyone's problem."  The ALA predicts that 10 million Americans  are infected with TB, and about 10 percent of them will develop  the disease because their immune systems are depressed,  especially those with AIDS or HIV.  Gene HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 46Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993Tammes, a Centers for  Disease Control expert, said that is why the CDC has issued  guidelines warning hospitals and institutions not to mix AIDS  with TB patients.  State health officials believe the TB is also  spreading because those who are most susceptible are the least  likely to follow through with treatment.  In addition, the  increase is attributed to a shortage of public health services.   In New York City, TB is an epidemic "because the number of cases  is increasing faster than we can treat people," said Dr. George  Diferdinando, director of the New York State TB Control.   According to Diferdinando, curbing the spread of TB entails  keeping 85 percent or more of diagnosed TB cases in treatment.   About 40 percent of infected New York City residents don't  complete therapy.  When TB patients don't finish taking their  medication, multi-drug resistant TB can develop, which requires  taking more expensive drugs and can take two years instead of the normal six months to treat. ================================================================     "Increasing Frequency of Heterosexually Transmitted AIDS in  Southern Florida: Artifact or Reality?" American Journal of Public Health (04/93) Vol. 83, No. 4, P. 571  (Nwanyanwu, Okey C. et al.)      The alarmingly high rate of heterosexually acquired AIDS cases in southern Florida was partially related to misclassification of  risk, write Okey C. Nwanyanwu et al. of the Centers for Disease  Control in Atlanta, Ga.  The researchers investigated 168 such  AIDS cases from Broward and coastal Palm Beach counties.  All of  these cases attributed to heterosexual transmission reported  sexual contact with bisexual men, injecting drug users, or  persons born in countries where heterosexual contact is the  primary route of HIV transmission.  Medical records of patients,  in addition to records from social services, HIV counseling and  testing centers, and sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics  were reviewed.  If no other HIV risk factor was found from  medical record review, patients were interviewed using a  standardized questionnaire.  Once STD clinic and other medical  records were reviewed, 29 men and 7 women were reclassified into  other HIV transmission categories.  After adjustments were made  for the reclassification, the percentage of AIDS cases reported  from Palm Beach and Broward counties between January 1, 1989, and March 31, 1990, that was attributed to heterosexual transmission  decreased from 10 percent to 6 percent among men and from 33  percent to 28 percent among women.  While the percentage of  heterosexually transmitted AIDS cases in southern Florida  decreased after adjustment was made for reclassified cases, it  still remained above the national average, the researchers  conclude.HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::                                AIDS Statistics::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::                            World Health Organization, Geneva                        Organisation mondiale de la Sante, Geneve                              WEEKLY EPIDEMIOLOGICAL RECORD                           RELEVE EPIDEMIOLOGIQUE HEBDOMADAIRE15 January 1993 -

The cesarean rate in the United States is the third highest among 21 reporting countries, exceeded only by Brazil and Puerto Rico (1). This report presents data on cesarean deliveries from CDC's National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) for 1991 and compares these data with previous years.      Data on discharges from short-stay, nonfederal hospitals have been collected annually since 1965 in the NHDS, conducted by CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. For 1991, medical and demographic information were abstracted from a sample of 274,000 inpatients discharged from 484 participating hospitals. The 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a prior cesarean (VBAC) presented in this report are based on weighted national estimates from the NHDS sample of approximately 31,000 (11%) women discharged after delivery. The estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were calculated by applying cesarean rates from the NHDS to live births from national vital registration data. Therefore, estimates of the number of cesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based solely on the NHDS (2). Stated differences in this analysis are significant at the 95% confidence level, based on the two-tailed t-test with a critical value of 1.96.      In 1991, there were 23.5 cesareans per 100 deliveries, the same rate as in 1990 and similar to rates during 1986-1989 (Table 1). The primary cesarean rate (i.e., number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had no previous cesareans) for 1986-1991 also was stable, ranging from 16.8 to 17.5. In 1991, the cesarean rate in the South was 27.6, significantly (p<0.05) higher than the rates for the West (19.8), Midwest (21.8), and Northeast (22.6). Rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 years than for younger women; in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or government hospitals; in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in larger hospitals; and for deliveries for which Blue Cross/Blue Shield * and other private insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of payment (Table 2). The same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries.      Since the early 1970s, the number and percentage of births to older women increased; however, if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained the same as in 1986, the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 23.3, essentially the same as the 23.5 observed.      Based on the NHDS, of the approximately 4,111,000 live births in 1991, an HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993estimated 966,000 (23.5%) were by cesarean delivery. Of these, an estimated 338,000 (35.0%) births were repeat cesareans, and 628,000 (65.0%) were primary cesareans. Since 1986, approximately 600,000 primary cesareans have been performed annually. In 1986, 8.5% of women who had a previous cesarean delivered vaginally, compared with 24.2% in 1991. Of all cesareans in 1991, 35.0% were associated with a previous cesarean, 30.4% with dystocia (i.e., failure of labor to progress), 11.7% with breech presentation, 9.2% with fetal distress, and 13.7% with all other specified complications.      The average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 2.8 days. In comparison, the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 4.5 days, and for a repeat cesarean, 4.2 days -- nearly twice the duration for VBAC deliveries (2.2 days) or for vaginal deliveries that were not VBACs (2.3 days). In 1986, the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 3.2 days, for primary cesareans 5.2 days, for repeat cesareans 4.7 days, and for VBAC and non-VBAC vaginal deliveries 2.7 and 2.6 days, respectively. Reported by: Office of Vital and Health Statistics Systems, National Center for Health Statistics, CDC. Editorial Note: The cesarean rate in the United States steadily increased from 1965 through 1986; however, the findings in this report indicate that rates have been stable since 1986 (3). Because there is little evidence that maternal and child health status has improved during this time and because cesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of childbirth, a national health objective for the year 2000 (4) is to reduce the overall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary cesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries (objective 14.8).      Postpartum complications -- including urinary tract and wound infections -- may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries than for vaginal births (5). Moreover, the prolonged hospital stays for cesarean deliveries substantially increase health-care costs. For example, in 1991, the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were $7826 and $4720, respectively. The additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes $611 for physician fees and $2495 for hospital charges (6). If the cesarean rate in 1991 had been 15 (the year 2000 objective) instead of 23.5, the number of cesarean births would have decreased by 349,000 (617,000 versus 966,000), resulting in a savings of more than $1 billion in physician fees and hospital charges.      Despite the steady increase in VBAC rates since 1986, several factors may impede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean delivery. For example, VBAC rates substantially reflect the number of women offered trial of labor, which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 (7). Of women who are offered a trial of labor, 50%-70% could deliver vaginally (7) --a level already achieved by many hospitals (8). Trial of labor was routinely offered in 46% of hospitals surveyed in 1984 (the most recent year for which HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  2Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993national data are available) (9) when the VBAC rate (according to NHDS data) was 5.7%. The year 2000 objective specifies a VBAC rate of 35%, based on all women who had a prior cesarean, regardless of whether a trial of labor was attempted. To reach the overall cesarean rate goal, however, increases in the VBAC rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary rate.      One hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by applying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean delivery, by requiring a second opinion, and by instituting a peer-review process (10). Other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates include eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing reimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries; public dissemination of physician- and hospital-specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public awareness of differences in practices; and addressing malpractice concerns, which may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesarean delivery (4).

Although the risk of acquiring malaria for U.S. citizens and their dependents stationed overseas generally has been low, this risk varies substantially and unpredictably. During May 1992, the Office of Medical Services, Department of State (OMS/DOS), and CDC were notified of an increased number of malaria cases among official U.S. personnel stationed in Kampala, Uganda. A review of the health records from the Embassy Health Unit (EHU) in Kampala indicated that 27 cases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from March through June 1992 compared with two cases during the same period in 1991. EHU, OMS/DOS, and CDC conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases and identify potential risk factors for malaria among U.S. Embassy personnel. This report summarizes the results of the investigation.      Malaria blood smears from 25 of the 27 reported case-patients were available for review by OMS/DOS and CDC. A case of malaria was confirmed if the slide was positive for Plasmodium sp. Of the 25 persons, 17 were slide-confirmed as having malaria.      A questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the EHU to obtain information about residence, activities, use of malaria chemoprophylaxis, and use of personal protection measures (i.e., using bednets and insect repellents, having window and door screens, and wearing long sleeves and pants in the evening). Of the 157 persons eligible for the survey, 128 (82%) responded.      Risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in Kampala. Although the risk for malaria was higher among children aged less than or equal to 15 years (6/32 19%) than among persons greater than 15 years (11/94 12%), this difference was not significant (relative risk RR=1.6; 95% confidence interval CI=0.6-4.0). Eighty-two percent of the cases occurred among persons who had been living in Kampala for 1-5 years, compared with those living there less than 1 year. Travel outside of the Kampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for malaria.      Four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who participated in the survey: mefloquine, chloroquine and proguanil, chloroquine alone, and proguanil alone. In addition, 23 (18%) persons who responded were not using any malaria chemoprophylaxis. The risk for malaria was significantly lower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil (8/88 9%) than among persons using the other regimens or no prophylaxis (9/37 24%) (RR=0.4; 95% CI=0.2-0.9). Twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported side effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason.      The risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993all or most of the time (2/27 7%) than among persons who sometimes or rarely used bednets (15/99 15%) (RR=0.5; 95% CI=0.1-2.0). The risk for malaria was also lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening (0/16), compared with those who rarely used repellent (17/110 15%) (RR=0; upper 95% confidence limit=1.2). Risk for malaria was not associated with failure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the evening.      As a result of this investigation, EHU staff reviewed with all personnel the need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens. EHU staff also emphasized the need to use personal protection measures and made plans to obtain insecticide-impregnated bednets and to provide window and door screens for all personnel.

Editorial Note: In Uganda, the increase in malaria among U.S. personnel was attributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased malaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in sub-Saharan Africa. The findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and continued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in malaria-endemic areas -- preventive measures that are also important for short-term travelers to such areas.      Mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in Africa and in most other areas with chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum; however, in some areas (e.g., Thailand), resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness. In Africa, the efficacy of mefloquine, compared with chloroquine alone, in preventing infection with P. falciparum is 92% (1 ). Mefloquine is safe and well tolerated when given at 250 mg per week over a 2-year period. The risk for serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis (e.g., psychosis and convulsions) is low (i.e., 1.3-1.9 episodes per 100,000 users 2), while the risk for less severe adverse reactions (e.g., dizziness, gastrointestinal complaints, and sleep disturbances) is similar to that for other antimalarial chemoprophylactics (1).      Doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine, but the need for daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen (3,4). Chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense chloroquine resistance (e.g., Southeast Asia and Africa). In Africa, for persons who cannot take mefloquine or doxycycline, chloroquine and proguanil is an alternative, although less effective, regimen. Chloroquine should be used for malaria prevention in areas only where chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum has not been reported.

Vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis during infancy and childhood have been administered routinely in the United States since the late 1940s and has been associated with a greater than 90% reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with infection by these organisms. Because of the increasing number of vaccines now routinely recommended for infants, a high priority is the development of combined vaccines that allow simultaneous administration with fewer separate injections.      The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently licensed two new products for vaccinating children against these diseases: 1) the Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (tetanus toxoid conjugate, ActHIB Trademark), * for vaccination against Hib disease only and 2) a combined diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Hib conjugate vaccine (TETRAMUNE Trademark), a combination of vaccines formulated for use in vaccinating children against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease.                                ActHIB Trademark      On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a new Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine, polyribosylribitol phosphate-tetanus toxoid conjugate (PRP-T), manufactured by Pasteur Merieux Serum et Vaccins and distributed as ActHIB Trademark by Connaught Laboratories, Inc. (Swiftwater, Pennsylvania). This vaccine has been licensed for use in infants in a three-dose primary vaccination series administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. Previously unvaccinated infants 7-11 months of age should receive two doses 2 months apart. Previously unvaccinated children 12-14 months of age should receive one dose. A booster dose administered at 15 months of age is recommended for all children. Previously unvaccinated children 15-59 months of age should receive a single dose and do not require a booster. More than 90% of infants receiving a primary vaccination series of ActHIB Trademark (consecutive doses at 2, 4, and 6 months of age) develop a geometric mean titer of anti-Haemophilus b polysaccharide antibody greater than 1 ug/mL (4). This response is similar to that of infants who receive recommended series of previously licensed Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines for which efficacy has been demonstrated in prospective trials. Two U.S. efficacy trials of PRP-T were terminated early because of the concomitant licensure of other Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  8Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993for use in infants (4). In these studies, no cases of invasive Hib disease were detected in approximately 6000 infants vaccinated with PRP-T. These and other studies suggest that the efficacy of PRP-T vaccine will be similar to that of the other licensed Hib vaccines. TETRAMUNE Trademark      On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a combined diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine. TETRAMUNE Trademark, available from Lederle-Praxis Biologicals (Pearl River, New York), combines two previously licensed products, DTP (TRIIMMUNOL Registered, manufactured by Lederle Laboratories Pearl River, New York) and Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (HibTITER Registered, manufactured by Praxis Biologics, Inc. Rochester, New York).      This vaccine has been licensed for use in children aged 2 months-5 years for protection against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease when indications for vaccination with DTP vaccine and Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine coincide. Based on demonstration of co mparable or higher antibody responses to each of the components of the two vaccines, TETRAMUNE Trademark is expected to provide protection against Hib, as well as diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, equivalent to that of already licensed formulations of other DTP and Haemophilus b vaccines.      The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that all infants receive a primary series of one of the licensed Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines beginning at 2 months of age and a booster dose at age 12-15 months (5). The ACIP also recommends that all infants receive a four-dose primary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine at 2, 4, 6, and 15-18 months of age, and a booster dose at 4-6 years (6-8). A complete statement regarding recommendations for use of ActHIB Trademark and TETRAMUNE Trademark is being developed.

The workshop was organized by Dr. John Greenspan and Dr. Deborah Greenspan of the Department of Stomatology, School of Dentistry, University of California, San Francisco.  An international steering committee and scientific program committee provided guidance.      The conference drew more than 260 scientists from 39 countries, including Asia, Africa, Europe, Central America, South America, as well as the United States and Canada.  Support tor the workshop was provided by the National Institute of Dental Research, the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the NIH Office of AIDS Research, and the Procter and Gamble Company.      Among the topics discussed were: the epidemiology of HIV lesions; ethics, professional responsibility, and public policy; occupational issues; provision of oral care to the HIV-positive population; salivary HIV transmission and mucosal immunity; opportunistic infections; pediatric HIV infection; and women's issues.                                 Recommendations     Recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association between the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of HIV, to establish a universal terminology for HIV-associated oral lesions, to look for more effective treatments for oral manifestations, to expand molecular biology studies to understand the relationship between HIV infection and common oral lesions, and to study the effects of HIV therapy on oral lesions.                                  Epidemiology     Since the First International Workshop on Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection was convened five years ago, the epidemiology of HIV infection has HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993radically changed.  In 1988, HIV infection was detected and reported largely in homosexual and bisexual males, intravenous drug users, and hemophiliacs.  Today, more HIV infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in children and adolescents.      While the predominant impact of HIV infection has been felt in Africa, a major increase in infection rate is being seen in Southeast Asia as well.  Five hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more are appearing all the time.      Researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions such as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis.  They also are beginning to explore the relationships between specific oral lesions and HIV disease progression and prognosis.                             Social/political Issues     Discussion on the social and political implications of HIV infection focused on changing the public's attitude that AIDS is retribution for indiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use.  Speakers also addressed health care delivery for HIV-infected patients, and the need to educate the public about what AIDS is, and how it is acquired.                           Saliva and Salivary Glands     Conference speakers described transmission issues and the HIV-inhibitory activity of saliva, the strength of which varies among the different salivary secretions.  Whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular secretions, which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid secretions.  Research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible for salivary inhibitory activity.  They attributed the HIV-inhibitory effect of saliva to the 1) aggregation/agglutination of HIV by saliva, which may both promote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell, and 2) direct effects on the virus or target cells.      Other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease in HIV-infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity.                                Pediatric Issues     Pediatric AIDS recently has emerged as an area of intense interest.  With early and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment, the life expectancy of HIV-infected children has tripled.  The prevention of transmission of HIV from mother to child may be possible in many cases, particularly if the mother's sero-status is known prior to giving birth.

Recommendations made at the workshop include the standardization of terminology, refinement of diagnostic markers, standardization of study design, and proper consideration of confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy.                        Occupational and Treatment Issues     Occupational issues surrounding the treatment of HIV-infected individuals and treatment rendered by HIV-infected health care professionals still command considerable attention.  Factors under consideration include the cost/benefit of HIV testing, patient-to-health care provider transmission of HIV infection and the reverse, and the use of mainstream versus dedicated facilities for the treatment of HIV-infected patients.      Conference participants anticipate that a third International Workshop on the Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection will be held in five years or less.  Proceedings from the second workshop will be published by the Quintessence Company in late 1993.--------- end of part 1 ---------------      Internet: david@stat.com                  FAX: +1 (602) 451-1165      Bitnet: ATW1H@ASUACAD                     FidoNet=> 1:114/15                Amateur Packet ax25: wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.na

I am very pleased with the results.  The catalog description is as follows:The Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager that actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like aprofessional shiatsu masseur.  The powerful motor drives twocounter-rotating "thumbs" that move in one-inch orbits --releasing tension in the neck, back, legs and arms.Pressure Point Massager    A2623   $109To order or receive a catalog, call (24 hours, 7 days) 1-800-345-3371 orfax at 1-800-345-4021.********NOTE:When I ordered the massager, the item number was different, and the pricewas $179, not $109.  When I received it, I glanced thru the newer catalogenclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one.  I was  QUITE annoyed to see a $70 difference in price.  I called them about it,and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers, although itlooks and works exactly the same.  He told me to go ahead and return thefirst one and order the cheaper one, using the price difference as areason for return.  In fact, since the newer ones might take a while toship from the factory (I received this one in 3 days), he told me I could use the one I already have until the new one arrives, then return the old one.  VERY reasonable people.********I have long-term neck, shoulder and back pain (if I were a building, I would be described as "structurally unsound :-) ).  I have stretches and exercises to do that help, but the problem never really goes away.  If, for whatever reason, I do not exercise for a while (illness, not enoughtime, lazy, etc.), the muscles become quite stiff and painful and, thus, more prone to further strain.  Even with exercise, I sometimes require physical therapy to get back on track, which 1st requires a doctor visit to get the prescription for p.t.  The tension in my neck, if not released, eventually causes a headache(sometimes confused with a sinus headache) over my left eye.  When my physical therapist has massaged my neck, and the sub-occipital muscles in particular (the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull), the headache usually eased within a day, although it hurts like hell to while it is being massaged.I ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishingsomeone would invent --a machine that would massage, NOT VIBRATE, my neck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in the past, that I could use by myself.  No doctor visit or inconvenient p.t. appts for a week later would be needed to use it.  I could get up in the middle of the night and use it, if necessary.I have been using it for about a week or so now, and LOVE it.  The baseunit is about a 14" x 9" rectangle, about 3-3/4" high, with handles on eachside, and it plugs into an average outlet.  The two metal "thumbs" are about 1-1/2" in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2" above the base.  The thumbs are covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable.  They are located more toward one end, rather than centered (see figure below).  They move in either clockwise or counter-clockwise directions, depending on which side of the switch is pushed, and are very quiet.  It can be used from eitherside.  For instance, the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neckor the top of the neck, depending on which direction you approach it.                 _______________________________                |  __    _______________    __  |                | |  |  ||  |  | |                | |  |  |  \\^^/   \\^^/  |  |  | |                | |  |  |   ||     ||   |  |  | |                | |  |  ||  |  | |                | |  |  |_______________|  |  | |                | |__|   |__| |                |_______________________________|For the neck/head, the user varies the amount of pressure used by (if laying down) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and/or neck to rest on the thumbs.  The handles can also be used if sitting orstanding, applying pressure with the arms/wrists.  Since my wrists arealso impaired (I'm typing this over an extended period of time), and I don't have someone living with me who can apply it, laying down works well for me.For my back, I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair, position the massagerbehind me at whatever point I want massaged, and lean back lightly (ornot so lightly) against it.  The pressure of leaning back holds it in place.  If I want to massage the entire spine, I simply move it down a few inches whenever I feel like it.  For my back, this machine is far superior to use than the commonly used "home-made" massager of 2 tennis balls taped together (with the balls, position (against a wall or door) them over the spine and move the body up and down against them).  The tennis balls are better than nothing, but difficult to use for very long, especially if your quads are not in good shape, and my long hair gets (painfully) in the way if I don't pin it up first.  As far as I'm concerned, the easier something like this is to use, the more likely I'll use/do it.  If there are multiple considerations/hassles, I'm more likely to not bother with it.Not only has this machine helped with my headaches, but my range of motion for my neck and back are greatly increased.  The first time I used it on myneck/sub-occipital muscles, however, I overdid it and pressed too hardagainst it, which resulted in a very tender, almost bruised area for afew days.  I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice, which helped.  After that, I was more gradual about applying pressure.  At this point, the pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged.  I also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back, which is the most vulnerable point for me.It also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades,although, again, it took a few days of massaging (just a few minutes ata time) to really work it out.I highly recommend this product if you have similar problems, although Icannot vouch for its durability (it seems pretty sturdy), since I've hadit such a short time.  I plan to use it not only to ease tension, but also to loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising (and maybe after, too).  I havebeen ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks, so this was very timely  for me.This is the 1st product I've ordered from this company and only recentlybecame aware of it thru a co-worker.  The catalog states they have beenin business since 1976.  It contains quite a few health care products and,while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalogproducts, they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thoughtput into what they actually do.  Definitely a step above some other onesI've seen such as "Dr. Leonards Health Care Catalog" or "Mature Wisdom".I'm only 37, but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists (nobig surprise here :-) ).  I consider many of those products to be rip-offs, particularly targeted toward the elderly, with dubious health benefits.I apologize for the length of this, but it's the kind of info _I_ would like to know before ordering something thru the mail.Robin Coutellier                   Northern Telecom, Mountain View, CAINTERNET: robin@ntmtv.comUUCP:portal!ntmtv!robin

Ditto stuff like licorice root.  Takinganything as a drug for theraputic purposes implicitly carries the ideaof taking a dose where the benefits are not exceeded by any unwanted,additional effects.  Taking any drug when the potential ill-effects arenot known is a risk assumed by the parties involved, and it may be thatin a given situation the risk is worthwhile.   Like Prozac, for instance; Prozac has been shown to be theraputic insome cases where the tri-cyclics fail.  But Prozac hasn't been in usethat long, and it really isn't clear what if any effects it may havewhen taken over long periods of time, even though it has been testedby present day standards.  Should Prozac be taken off the market becauselong-term effects, if any, are not known?

Make a decision about whether you *really*want to be a medical doctor.  I had classmates who dropped outin the first semester of med school because they found it wasnot what they wanted to do; I have friends who applied fouryears in a row before they were accepted.  Medicine as acareer is a choice you must make for yourself; DON'T bepushed into it because of your parents/family/significantother.  If you still want to be a medical doctor, determine how youcan improve your application.  A letter of recommendation froma professor who knows you well and can give an honest positiverecommendation is far better than one from a 'big-shot' famousprofessor who only vaguely remembers your face.  Also, don'tbe afraid to ask these people if they can give you an honestand positive recommendation; give them a chance to say 'no,sorry' instead of the medical school saying 'no, sorry'.  Ihave turned down writing recommendations for some studentsbecause I did not know them well enough to make any meaningfulcomments, and some because I honestly could not recommend themat that point.  Rewrite your personal statement; take it by an Englishprofessor or some other friendly person with skill andexperience in writing and proof-reading and get theircriticism, both about what you are saying as well as how yousay it.Review your academic accomplishments.  If your grades are poorin some area, don't be afraid to spend some time in furthercoursework.  Evidence of determined committment will helphere.  If you filled your pre-medicine curriculum with gutcourses, it usually shows.Look at your extracurricular involvements.  Participating inlocal philanthropic or service organizations is a plus;substantial leadership roles in an organization help also.Beware of 'resume padding'; such things are not difficult tospot and weed out.Overall, a clear conception of where you wish to head and whyyou want to get there, combined with an honest self-appraisalof skills and aptitude, will be the best path to take inapplying to any program, medical or what-have-you.Good luck with the process -- as Tom Petty says, 'the waitingis the hardest part', at least emotionally. :)Bob Schmieg

Did somebody piss you off at one time?|>  On the other hand, it really cant hurt you anywhere but your wallet, and place|> bo effects of anything can be pretty dramatic...I agree with you that chromium picolinate by itself isn't likelyto make a fat person thin.  But it can be the decisive componentof an overall strategy for long-term weight control and make animportant contribution to good health.  It is important toexercise (11, 12) and also avoid fat calories (9, 10).Chromium picolinate has shown to reduce fat and increaselean muscle (1, 2, 3).  I will not bore you with thestatistics.  You wouldn't believe these anyway.Chromium Picolinate is an exceptionally bioactive source ofthe essential mineral chromium.  Chromium plays a vital rolein "sensitizing" the body's tissues to the hormone insulin.Weight gain in the form of fat tends to impair sensitivityto insulin and thus, in turn, makes it harder to loseweight (4).Insulin directly stimulates protein synthesis and retardsprotein breakdown in muscles (5, 6).  This "protein sparing"effect of insulin tends to decline during low calorie dietsas insulin levels decline, which results in loss of muscleand organ tissue.  By "sensitizing" muscle to insulin,chromium picolinate helps to preserve muscle in dietersso that they "burn" more fat and less muscle.  Preservationof lean body mass has an important long-term positiveeffect on metabolic rate, helping dieters keep off thefat they've lost.Chromium picolinate promotes efficient metabolism by aidingthe thermogenic (heat producing) effects of insulin.Insulin levels serve as a rough index of the availabilityof food calories, so it's not at all surprising that insulin stimulates metabolism (4, 7, 8).  Note that I did not saythat chromium picolinate increases metabolism.In summary, you need to change your life style in order toloose weight and stay healthy:  A. Reduce dietary fat consumption to no more than 20% of calories.     - Eating fat makes you fat.  B. Increase dietary fiber     - low in calories; high in nutrients.  C. Get regular aerobic exercise at least 3 times a week     - burn calories.  D. Take chromium picolinate daily     - lose fat; keep muscleReferences:1.  Kaats GR, Fisher JA, Blum K.

However it is also widely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity. And in ordinary life, perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is indicative of a psychological disorder.  In the extreme case, a  perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might make that he is unable to even leave the house.  In science, we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible and we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these discoveries.  Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata --- the search for scope and the search for certainty.  If 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton and Leibniz then there would probably be no calculus today, because neither of the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense, since they lacked the concept of a limit.  And in fact, because of the lack of a rigorous foundation, they made a number of errors in their use of calculus. It was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid grounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz.  Nonetheless, what Newton and Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great deal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost through the mistakes they made.  In article <1993Apr14.171230.16138@kestrel.edu> king@reasoning.com     (Dick King) writes:>  [ Somebody writes: ]>>I doubt if Einstein used any formal methodology.  ....>  ....>He also proposed numerous experiments which if performed would distinguish a>universe in which special relativity holds from one in which it does not.>         ....>Einstein played by the rules, which demand that hypotheses only be put out>there if there exists a specific experiment that could disprove them.These are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med andsci.psychology.  According to these posters  "If it's not supported bycarefully designed controlled studies then it's not science."Taken to the extreme, I believe that the attitude that empirical studies are everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification of science.  For one thing, an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology results in a sort of scientific trade-unionism, where those outside the establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have no chance to obtain a hearing.  (I don't in the least believe that this is the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology.  Nonetheless, it is one of the results.)   And although institutional science has certainly produced many wonderful results, I think it is a foolish arrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment --- and using less than perfect empirical methodology --- will ever come with anything worthwhile.  Furthermore, the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think isone of the most significant errors in science:  choosing to investigatequestions because they can be readily handled by the currentlyfashionable methodology (or because one can readily get institutionalor corporate sponsorship for them) instead of directing attention tothose questions which seem to have fundamental significance.For instance, certain questions cannot be easily investigated withstatistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative.(One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in manyareas of psychology.  In my opinion, a perusal of many of the papersresulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questionsinto a statistical framework gives the lie to Russell Turpin'sassertion that current scientific methods "avoid all known errors.")I think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental error in science.  (Ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the others.)  And I think that scientific journals are full of all too many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are worthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place.  --In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet

Our  three year old daughter suffers from this disease.  Below is a press release  that appeared in local newspapers.  Hope you can join us.On Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family  will be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public  awareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.Bill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease  characterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and  trachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would  lead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.   Three year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis  last year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her  lifetime.  Even though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives  of enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory  Papillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide  support for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a  newsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid  in the prevention, cure, and treatment.Since medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to  those viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money  were available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant  attention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP  Foundation's mission is to change that. Anyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call  Marlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.  Monetary donations can be made at the  Foundation's booth during Communiversity, April 24th, 12 to 4 p.m., in downtown  Princeton, or sent directly to:The Recurrent Respiratory Foundation                50 Wesleyan Drive                Hamilton Sq., NJ  08690.Thanks   mstern@lindsay.princeton.edu

Thearcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the median eminence regionsare particularly effected.  CVO areas are not subject to theblood-brain barrier. These areas control the release of gonadotropin,which controls the release and flux of steroids governing development,especially sexual development. Changes in adult rats, which are lesssensitive to Glu than humans, have been observed: after ingesting Glu,on a chronic basis, cycles of several steroids are disrupted. Bloodlevels of somatostatin are significantly reduced, and cyclic releaseof steroids becomes flattened.                    Hope this helps.                    --Dianne Murray: wcsbeau@ccs.carleton.ca

You're a wonderful speaker and an adept politician.However, I believe that all you were asked to do, was simply provide scientificresearch refuting the work of Olney. I don't think the original poster soughtto start a philisophical debate. she wanted some information. Given a littleeffort one could justify that shooting oneself with a .45 before breakfast is ahealthy practice. But we're not particularily interested in what you canverbally prove/disprove or rationalize. Where's the research? Where are thestudies?I appoligize if this sounds flamish.

These effects are a very real concern in conducting studies of newtreatments.  Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by performing studies that are "blind" in various ways.  Some of theseare:  o  The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a      placebo or the test treatment, i.e., whether they are in the     control group or the test group.  o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects      receive a placebo or the test treatment.  o  Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects     receive a placebo or the test treatment.Obviously, at the point at which the data is analyzed, one has to differentiate the test group from the control group.  But the analysisis quasi-public: the researcher describes it and presents the data onwhich it is based so that others can verify it.  It is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects areanimals, such as mice, there were many cases of skewed results becausethose who performed the study did not "blind" themselves.  It is notconsidered so important to make mice more ignorant than they alreadyare, though it is important that in all respects except the one tested,the control and test groups are treated alike.Russell

Noring has pointed outthe catch-22 that if the "crazy" theory were true, you probably couldn'tfind any direct evidence of it --- that you couldn't observe those yeastiebeasties with present methods even if they were there.  Noring and thefellow from Oklahoma (sorry, forgot your name) have also suggested one setof anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences ---namely, that when people with certain conditions are given anti-fungals,many of them appear to get better.  So, if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis --- for example,controlled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals don't do anybetter than sugar water --- then let's hear it.  If you don't, then what wehave is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side, and abjectdisbelief on the other.  In which case, please, there is no point in yellingback and forth at each other any longer since neither side has anyconvincing evidence either positive or negative.  And I understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence ofpeople who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everythingin sight, making wild claims with no evidence, and always refusing to docontrolled studies.  But that has absolutely no bearing on the apparentlysincere experiences of the people on the net observing anti-fungals workingon themselves and other people in certain specific cases.  There are alsoquacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase, in spite of the fact that it'scompletely broken down in the guts, but this doesn't change the genuinescientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fightingoxidative damage.  Same thing.  Just cause there are candida quacks, thatdoesn't establish evidence against the candida hypothesis.  If there's someother reason (besides the quacks), if only anecdotal, to think it could betrue, then that is what has to be considered, that is what the net peoplehave been talking about.But again, there is no point in arguing about it.  There is anecdotalevidence, and there is no convincing evidence, and there are also somecandida quacks out there, I hope everyone can agree on all of that.  Thus,it appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents canmarshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enoughmanner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double-blindstudy of antifungals (or else, forget convincing anybody else to carry outthe test, just carry it out themselves!) --- and also, whether they canadequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a studyshould be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis.Ken--

Fromanother (tautologic) perspective, any disease is in the domain ofthe specialty that treats it.

Simple blood tests would indicate if a thyroidcondition is present.I don't know if depression would cause a reduction in thyroid output,but I would tend to doubt it. As far as I know clinical depression iscaused by a chemical imbalance in the brain, and that chemicalimbalance has no direct effect on any other part of the body. A regulareveryday depression IMHO should not cause a chemical imbalance in thebody at all.The pituitary bases its secretions of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)on the level of circulating Thyroxin (there are two types T3 and T4 -one is used as a reserve and is changed into the other -active- form inthe liver). The ratio of T3 & T4 can be affected by a number of otherhormones (estrogen, for example). Naturally, changing activity of thebody's cells would cause changes in availabilty of free thyroxin, butthe liver and a healthy thyroid should be able to balance things out inshort order.Good sources for info on the thyroid are the Merk Manual (a physician'sreference book ) although reading it is enough to get one depressed :-)and the Encyclopedia Brittanica (should be available in your locallibrary).I hope this has been of some help.-Eileen Bauer

Most early treatment ofnon-life threatening illness is done on a guess, hazarded after anecdotalevidence given by the patient. It's an educated guess, by a trained person,but it's still no more than a guess.It's cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with thosepeople who don't respond.There are diseases that haven't been described yet and the root cause of manydiseases now described aren't known. (Read a book on gastroenterologysometime if you want to see a lot of them.) After scientific methods haverun out then it's the patient's freedom of choice to try any experimentalmethod they choose. And it's well recognized by many doctors that medicinedoesn't have all the answers.This person said that they had relief by taking the medicine. Maybe it's amiracle cure, maybe it's valid. How do you know?  You might argue with the reasoning, the conclusions. But your disparagingattack is unwarranted. Why don't you present an convincing argument for your beliefs, instead of wasting our time in an ad hominem attack.-Jackie-

I'm>trying to learn what I can about it. Any info would be appreciated.>Thanks.You've asked a toughie of a question.  There are many different drugs whichare used for chemotherapy.The overall purpose of chemotherapy (don't worry about the spelling.  Some ofthese crazy medical words are impossible to spell! :-) is to either destroycancer cells or to keep them from growing.  Different drugs have differenteffects on cancer cells, and therefore, it is not uncommon to use more thanone drug at a time.Some chemotherapeutic drugs are effective anytime during the growth cycleof a cell.  Others work only at specific times during the cell cycle.The first phase of the cell cycle is G1; it is when the protein synthesisand RNA systhesis occurs.  In the second phase, S, synthesis of DNA occurs.The third phase is G2; The DNA splits and RNA and protein are synthesized aagain.  In the fourth phase, M (or Mitosis), the cell may divide.There are drugs which are effective in each phase.  Some stop DNA synthesis.Others stop the cell from dividing. Others wreck protein synthesis.At any rate, the end result that is being sought is for the cancer cellsto stop growing.If what you are seeking is "practical" advice, I apologize for ramblingon the techno stuff.  Some side effects are pretty common.  Chemo. drugsare rather nasty.  It can cause a person to lose their appetite and to experience nausea and vomiting.  Things to help this include eating smallfrequent meals.  It is also suggested that if nausea/vomiting (hereafterknown as n/v) occurs that the person notify the doctor; there are medicinestthat help nausea.  Diarrhea can be an effect.  Antidiarrheal medications can be given, and good skincare and fluid intake are important.Probably the one of biggest concsern is hair loss.  This does not alwayshappen.  It depends on what drugs are being given, and on the person themself.  Different people taking the same drug can and do have differentside effects.  I have seen some literature which states that wearing a snugheadband and/or wearing an ice cap can help reduce hair loss, presumablyby reducing blood flow to the scalp.  If anyone has seen research on thistoo, I would love to see it, and possibly some bib data.I highly recommend making contact with the American Cancer Society.They have a vast selection of literature and information.  In addition,if your friend has had a mastectomy, I highly recommend "Reach for Recovery".It is a support group comprised entirely of women who have lost a breast because of cancer.  They can offer some excellent support and suggestions.If you have further questions, please send me E-mail.  I hav some goodaccess to information, and I enjoy trying to help other people.I wish the best to you and your friend.

These words have multiple meanings.As a self-proclaimed atheist, I believe that *some* conceptionsof god are inconsistent or in conflict with fact, and I lackbelief in other conceptions of god merely because there is noreason for me to believe in these.  I usually use the wordagnostic to mean someone who believes that the existence ofa god is unknown inherently unknowable.

Guidleines have been set on the number of dental x-rays and chest x-rays that one should have over a given period of time because of all the environmental factors that can cause cancer in humans, ionizing radiation is one of the most potent(splits DNA and causes hydroxyl free radical formation in tissue cells).  Ultasound(like that used in seeing the fetus in the uterus) has been shown to be extremely good at picking up tumors in the prostate and gallstones in the gallbladder.  But kidney tissue may be too dense for ultrasound to work for kidney stones(any radiologists care to comment?).Most stones will pass(but it's a very painful process).  Unlike gallstones, I don't think that there are many drugs that can help "dissolve" the kidney stone(which is probably calcium-oxalate).  Vitamin C and magnesium have worked in rabbits to remove calcium from calcified plaques in the aterial wall.  I have no idea if a diet change or supplementation could speed up the process of kidney stone passage(but I'm pretty confident that a diet change and/or supplementation can prevent a reoccurance).  If surgery is being contemplated, the stone must be in the kidney tubule.  A second opinion is a good idea because there are better(less damaging) ways to break up the stone if it's logged within the kidney(sonic blasts).  HMO's are notorious for conservative care and long waits for expensvie treatments.  My condolences to your friend. Marty B.

But colonic flushes are not the way to improve gut function.  Each person has almost a unique mix of bacteria in his/her gut.  Diet affects this mix as does the use of antibiotics.  A diet change is a much better way to alter the players in your gut than is colonic flushes.  Cross contamination has been a real problem in some of the outfits that do this "treatment" since the equipment is not always cleaned as well as it should be between patient "treatments".Dental drills have me a little concerned about HIV infection and I've picked a dentist that uses both chemical and autoclave sterilization of his instruments(more clostly but much safer).  Full sterile technique is also used just like that practiced in an OR(mask, gloves and gowns worn and disposed of between patients).  Each visit costs me 15 dollars more than the standard and customary fee so I have to pay it out of pocket.  His much higher fees do not drive away patients.I can not think of any good reason why someone should subject themselves to this colonic flush procedure.  For very little, if any benefit, you subject yourself to hepatitis, cholera, parasitic disease and even HIV.Just ask yourself why someone might resort to this kind of treatment?Could they be having GI distress?  Could this distress be due to a pathogenic organism?  Could I get this organism if the equipment is not cleaned properly between patients?  Do I really want to take this risk?Food for thought.Marty B.

If you have questions, you wantto send mail to Richard, not me.  -- Dan      Software Tools to help with RSI    ------------------------------- This file describes tools, primarily software, to help prevent or manage RSI.This version now includes information on such diverse tools as calendarprograms and digital watches... Please let me know if you know any other tools, or if you have informationor opinions on these ones, and I will update this FAQ.I am especially interested in getting reviews of these products from peoplewho have evaluated them or are using them.   Richard Donkin                           Internet mail: richardd@hoskyns.co.uk              Tel: +44 71 814 5708 (direct)Fax: +44 71 251 2853Changes in this version:     Added information on StressFree, another typing management tool      for Windows.TYPING MANAGEMENT TOOLS: these aim to help you manage your keyboard use,by warning you to take a break every so often.  The better ones also includeadvice on exercises, posture and workstation setup.  Some use sound hardware to warn of a break, others use beeps or screen messages.Often, RSI appears only after many years of typing, and the pain hasa delayed action in the short term too: frequently you can be typingall day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening.These tools act as an early warning system: by listening to theirwarnings and taking breaks with exercises, you don't have to wait for your body to give you a more serious and painful warning - that is, getting RSI.     Tool: At Your Service (commercial software)    Available from:Bright StarTel: +1 (206) 451 3697    Platforms: Mac (System 6.0.4), Windows    Description:Provides calendar, keyboard watch, email watch, and system info. Warns when to take a break (configurable).  Has a few recommendationson posture, and exercises.  Sound-oriented, will probably work best with sound card (PC) or with microphone (Mac).  Should be possibleto record your own messages to warn of break.     Tool: AudioPort (sound card and software)    Available from:Media VisionTel: +1 (510) 226 2563    Platforms: PC    Description:A sound card to plug into your PC parallel port.Includes 'At Your Service'.     Tool: Computer Health Break (commercial software)    Available from:Escape Ergonomics, Inc1111 W. El Camino RealSuite 109Mailstop 403Sunnyvale, CATel: +1 (408) 730 8410    Platforms: DOS    Description:Aimed at preventing RSI, this program warns you to takebreaks after a configurable interval, based on clock time, orafter a set number of keystrokes -- whichever is earlier.It gives you 3 exercises to do each time, randomly selected froma set of 70.  Exercises are apparently tuned to the type of workyou do - data entry, word processing, information processing.Exercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text onhow to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does.CHB includes hypertext information on RSI that you can use to learn more about RSI and how to prevent it.  Other informationon non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer.A full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included.CHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows, but does not thenwarn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appearuseful when used with Windows.Cost: $79.95; quantity discounts, site licenses.    Comments:The keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems betterto measure the activity that is causing you problems than tomeasure clock time or even typing time.  The marketing stuffis very good and includes some summaries of research papers,as well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company to pay up for RSI management tools.      Tool: EyerCise (commercial software)    Available from:RAN EnterprisesOne Woodland Park Dr.Haverhill, MA  01830, USTel: 800-451-4487 (US only)    Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1), OS/2 PM (1.3/2.0) [Not DOS]    Description:Aimed at preventing RSI and eye strain, this program warns you to takebreaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). Optionallydisplays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures areanimated and program beeps you to help you do exercises at thecorrect rate.  Includes 19 stretches and 4 visual training exercises, can configure which are included and how many repetitionsyou do - breaks last from 3 to 7 minutes.  Also includes online help on workplace ergonomics.  Quote from their literature:"EyerCise is a Windows program that breaks up your day with periodicsets of stretches and visual training exercises.  The stretches workall parts of your body, relieving tension and helping to preventRepetitive Strain Injury.  The visual training exercises will improveyour peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain.  Together thesehelp you to become more relaxed and productive." "The package includes the book _Computers & Visual Stress_ by Edward C.Godnig, O.D. and John S. Hacunda, which describes the ergonomic setupfor a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises topromote healthy and efficient computer use. Cost: $69.95 including shipping and handling, quantity discountsfor resellers.  Free demo ($5 outside US).     Comments:I have a copy of this, and it works as advertised: I would sayit is better for RSI prevention than RSI management, because itdoes not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes.  Also, itinterrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time, whichis not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day.  Worked OK onWindows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not surewhy. Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC, and hasone window without window controls.  Very usable though, and does notrequire any sound hardware.    Tool: Lifeguard (commercial software)    Available from:Visionary SoftwareP.O. Box 69447Portland, OR  97201, USTel: +1 (503) 246-6200    Platforms: Mac, DOS (Windows version underway)    Description:Aimed at preventing RSI.  Warns you to take a breakwith dialog box and sound.  Includes a list of exercisesto do during breaks, and information on configuring yourworkstation in an ergonomic manner.  Price: $59;quantity discounts and site licenses.  The DOS product isbought in from another company, apparently; not sure howequivalent this is to the Mac version.The Mac version got a good review in Desktop Publisher Magazine (Feb 1991).  Good marketing stuff with useful 2-page summaries of RSI problems and solutions, with references.     Tool: StressFree (commercial software, free usable demo)    Available from:LifeTime SoftwareP.O.

Anon FTP:   ftp.cica.indiana.edu (and mirroring sites)    Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1) (Mac and DOS versions underway)    Description:Aimed at preventing RSI, this program warns you to takebreaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). Displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures areanimated and program paces you to help you do exercises at thecorrect rate.  Quite a few exercises, can configure which onesare included to some extent.  Online help.Version 2.0 is out soon, Mac and DOS versions will be basedon this.Cost: $29.95 if support via CompuServe or Internet, otherwise $39.95.                Site license for 3 or more copies is $20.00 each.      (NOTE: prices may have gone up for V2.0).     Comments:I have had a play with this, and it works OK.  Its user interfacedesign is much better in 2.0, though still a bit unusual.expensive tool around and it does the job.  It is also the onlytool with a redistributable demo, so if you do get the demo, post iton your local bulletin boards, FTP servers and Bitnet servers!Does not include general info on RSI and ergonomics, but it does have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence,which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises.    Tool: Typewatch (freeware), version 3.8 (October 1992)    Available from:Email to richardd@hoskyns.co.ukAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/typewatch.shar    Platforms: UNIX (tested on SCO, SunOS, Mach; character and X Window mode)    Description:This is a shell script that runs in the background and warns youto stop typing, based on how long you have been continuouslytyping.  It does not provide exercises, but it does checkthat you really do take a break, and tells you when youcan start typing again.  Typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typingtoday, each time it warns you, which is useful so youknow how much you *really* type.  It also logs informationto a file that you can analyse or simply print out.  The warning message appears on your screen (in character mode),in a pop-up window (for X Windows), or as a Zephyr message(for those with Athena stuff).   Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu> has put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for X, Zephyr and Mach.Not formally supported, but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk(for SCO, SunOS, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach,X Window mode, Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give feedback.    Tool: Various calendar / batch queue programs    Available from:Various sources    Platforms: Various    Description:Any calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcomingappointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool.Or, any batch queue submission program that lets you submita program to run at a specific time to display a message tothe screen.Using Windows as an example: create a Calendar file, andinclude this filename in your WIN.INI's 'load=' line soyou get it on every startup of Windows.  Suppose youwant to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am.Press F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment, enter9:30, hit Enter, and type some text in saying what the breakis for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat for the next appointment.By using Windows Recorder, you can record the keystrokesthat set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put thisfile on your 'run=' line, as above, and you will then, witha single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointmentswith RSI exercises.The above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs. An example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple jobthat runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this willdepend a lot on your operating system.While these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing yourself to take a break if you can't get hold of a suitable RSI management tool.  If you are techie enough you might want towrite a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operatingsystem, using batch jobs or whatever fits best.    Tool: Digital watches with count-down timers    Available from:Various sources, e.g. Casio BP-100.    Description:Many digital watches have timers that count down from a settablenumber of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, eithermanually or automatically.  While these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if youare writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away froma computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The greatadvantage is that they remind you to break from whatever youare doing.    Comments:My own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led tomy writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, whichactually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the leftarm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has beenvery useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day.I have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, butthese are not much good because they do not give an audiblewarning of the end of the time period!KEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mappingso you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout.  One-handed typing tools may help, but be VERY careful about how you use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload youare simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing,and may therefore make matters worse.    Tool: hsh (public domain)    Available from:Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar    Platforms: UNIX (don't know which ones)    Description:Allows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings.Only works through tty's (so, you can use it with a terminal oran xterm, but not most X programs).    Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various)    Available from:Anonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.cAlso built into Windows 3.x.     Description:The Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layoutthat involves more balanced hand use.   It *may* help preventRSI a bit, but you can also use it if you have RSI, since it will slow down your typing a *lot* :-)  -- Dan Wallach               "One of the most attractive features of a Connectiondwallach@cs.berkeley.edu  Machine is the array of blinking lights on the facesOffice#: 510-642-9585     of its cabinet." -- CM Paris Ref.

In the US the FDA has yet to approve thisuse of the drug, but it is available as an oral inhaler (for COPD), andthese can be adapted for intranasal use.-- =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==  Kenneth Gilbert              __|__        University of Pittsburgh   ==  General Internal Medicine      |      "...dammit, not a programmer!" ==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

About five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes under one of her arms. After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor  suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue. While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being  manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm ( palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is  persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3 and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides minor reductions in pain and is only short term.   My questions are:      Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the     levels of pain?     Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced?     Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored?  Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated.      Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group.  If anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup  that I should be posting this to it would also be appreciated.        -- Gregory W.

This was passed by Congress in the1950's, before stuff like mass spectrometry became available, which increaseddetectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitude.This is why things like cyclamates and Red #2 were banned.  They are veryweakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats, so under the Act they arebanned.This also applies to natural carcinogens.  Some of you might remember atime back in the 1960's when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so good,and never tasted so good again.  That was the time when safrole was banned.This is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leaves.If it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days, someonewould do it, in order to make money.  The fact that no one does it indicatesthat enforcement is still in effect.An odd exception to the rule seems to be the product known as "gumbo file'".This is nothing more than coarsely ground dried sassafras leaves.  Thisis not only a natural product, but a natural product still in its naturalform, so maybe that's how they evade Delany.  Or maybe a special exemptionwas made, to appease powerful Louisiana Democrats.

He was at home for the first year and he didnot fall sick even once.  Now it seems like he has some sort of cold orflu pretty much once a month.  Most of the time the cold leads to an earinfection as well, with the result that he ends up being on antibiotics3 weeks out of 4.  I know kids in day care fall sick more often, but weare beginning to wonder how often "more often" really is, whether ourson is more susceptible or has lower immunity than average, what thelonger-term effects of constantly being sick and taking antibiotics are,and what we can do to build up his resistance.  He really enjoys his daycare and we think it's great too, but we are beginning to wonder whetherwe should think about getting a nanny.Are there any studies that can help answer some of these questions?-- How often do kids in their first, second and third years fall sick?How often do they get colds, flus, ear infections?  Is there any data onhome care vs. day care?-- Does being sick "build immunity" (leading to less illness later),does it make kids "weaker" (leading to more illness later), or does itnot have any long term effect?-- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative longterm effects?-- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness thannormal, and what does one do about it?-- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance?Any data, information or advice relating to this would be muchappreciated.  Thanks a lot.Ashwin.

As I recall, its been done to some experimental mice.They showed various ill effects and eventually died.  The reason isthat deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates ashydrogen due to its extra mass (which causes lower velocity, Boltzmanconstant, mumble).  This throws various bits of body biochemistry outof kilter, and you get sick and die.I've never heard of anyone being poisened this way, in or out of reallife.  The process takes quite a while.  If anyone wants to write thisbook, I would imagine you would have to:1: Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy   water.2: Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other   molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium.During this process the victim would gradually deteriorate andeventually die, but I imagine it would take weeks during which thepoisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of thewater the victim ingested was heavy.You would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be bothalarmed and confused.  Why should every organ in the body suddenlybegin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets theheavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a realstory here.Come to think of it, <2> would continue even after the heavy water wasno longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too late.The most detectable effect would be that the victim's body fluidswould literally be "heavy".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 andheavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victim's weight will increase byabout 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.  Maybethe detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices thatthe victim's urine is strangely dense.  Is there any medical testinvolving the specific gravity of a body fluid?Paul.-- Paul Johnson (paj@gec-mrc.co.uk).    | Tel: +44 245 73331 ext 3245--------------------------------------------+----------------------------------These ideas and others like them can be had | GEC-Marconi Research is notfor $0.02 each from any reputable idealist. | responsible for my opinions

This has beenan ellusive matter for researchers, and is one of the fundamental requirementsfor many to acknowledge an agent as being causitive of a particular disease.Up to now, only the vaccine manufacturer has been able to "prove" thatthe disease exists.This paper is noteworthy in two other regards:1) None of the animals they infected were treated in any way.  The dogshad episodes of lameness during a 6-8 week period which occurred 2-5months after exposure.  After this period, none showed any furtherclinical signs up to the 17 month observation period of the study.  Sothese are proven, clinically sick Lyme patients showing spontaneousrecovery without the benefit of drug treatment. Of course, observationslonger than 17 months will be necessary to be sure the disease doesn'thave the same chronicity that some see in humans.2)  The addendum to the paper calls into question the techniques used by thevaccine manufacturer to validate the vaccine.  Of course, they wantthe world to use the model they developed in order to test vaccineefficacy.Anyway, maybe we will see some independent, scientifically sound evaluationsof this vaccine in the next year or so.--Jeff Parke <jeffp@pgavin1.vetmed.wsu.edu>also:   jeffp@WSUVM1.bitnet    AOL: JeffParkeWashington State University College of Veterinary Medicine class of 1994Pullman, WA  99164-7012

What I tried to explain to Marty was that it is clearlyunderstood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infections- which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections. Marty made this sound like a secret  known only to veternarians andbiochemists.  Anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knownsthis. At some centers pre-op liver transplant patients receive boweldecontamination directed at retaining "good" anaerobic flora in an attemptto prevent fungal colonization in this soon-to-be high risk group.  I alsouse lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea (that maybe in part due to alterations in gut flora).  However, it is NOT part ofmy routine practice to "reinnoculate" patients with "good" bacteria afterantibiotics.  I have seen no data on this practice preventing or treatingfungal infections in at risk patients.  Whether or not it is a "logicalextension" from the available observations I'll leave to those of you whobase strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence ofclinical trials.   One place such therapy has been described is in treating particularlyrecalcitrant cases of C. difficile colitis (NOT a fungal infection). Thereare case reports of using stool (ie someone elses) enemas to repopulatethe patients flora.  Don't try this at home. >not give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams.

Seems like this is an excellent argument for ignoring anecdotalconventional wisdom (a euphemism for no data) and doing a good clinicaltrial, like: AU   Dismukes-W-E.  Wade-J-S.  Lee-J-Y.  Dockery-B-K.  Hain-J-D.TI   A randomized, double-blind trial of nystatin therapy for the     candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome [see comments]SO   N-Engl-J-Med.  1990 Dec 20.  323(25).  P 1717-23.     psychological tests. RESULTS. The three active-treatment regimens     and the all-placebo regimen     significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms (P less than     0.001), but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptoms     significantly more than placebo. [ . . . ]     CONCLUSIONS. In women with presumed candidiasis     hypersensitivity syndrome, nystatin does not reduce systemic or     psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo. Consequently,     the empirical recommendation of long-term nystatin therapy for such     women appears to be unwarranted.  Does this trial address every issue raised here, no.  Jon Noring was notsurprised at this negative trial since they didn't use *Sporanox* (despiteCrook's recommendation for Nystatin).  Maybe they didn't avoid thosecarbohydrates . . . >The conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to >be reinnoculated with *good* bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy.>If it makes sense for livestock, why doesn't it make sense for humans >David?  We are not talking about a dangerous treatment(unless you consider >yogurt dangerous).

Marty, you've also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiricitraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemichypersensitivity symptoms (Noring syndrome) to the yoghurt and vitamintherapy of undocumented candida enteritis (Elaine Palmer syndrome) withsystemic symptoms.  There is significant difference between the cost andrisk of these two empiric therapeutic trials.  Are we talking about "real"candida infections, the whole "yeast connection" hypothesis, the efficacyof routine bacterial repopulation in humans, or the ability of anecdotallyeffective therapies (challenged by a negative randomized trial) to confirman etiologic hypothesis (post hoc ergo propter hoc).  We can't seem tofocus in on a disease, a therapy, or a hypothesis under discussion.                                      I'm lost!

Rutin is NOT a herb, but part of the bioflavonoid complex. You should generally *not* take rutin by itself, but take the whole bioflavonoid  complex instead. If you don't (and there are some exceptions to that) you'll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency, which is the other major component of the bioflavonoid complex. I found out the hard way years ago when I recommended rutin, after it showed deficient in patients who were NOT deficient in hesperidin be- fore. A later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in  hesperidin, which, from then on, made me always *add* bioflavonoids  to anyone that had *very* low levels of rutin. Most of the time people are equally low in rutin *and* hesperidin, so there is really no reason to take rutin by itself, but use the whole bioflavonoid complex instead. I have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that  they had been helped with hemorrhoids, varicose veins, chronic nose  bleeds, aneurysms, gastro-intestinal bleeding (due to drugs), etc... One patient in desperation took a whole bottle (100's) in one day for his painful, bleeding hemorrhoids, without any ill effects.   They are also non-toxic in very high amounts, that's why they can be safely recommended. If you are allergic to citrus fruit (they are made from their peels), pine bark sources are available as well. About 90% of patients tested show a bioflavonoid deficiency,  with the average daily dosage needed being about 1 - 2,000mg. For major complaints, 4 - 6,000mg+/day is common.  In case they cannot be taken, because of their size and taste (they are big, and they don't taste that great), a product made from pine  bark extract gives you the same effect and the tablets are quite small and taste much better, however the cost is about seven times higher for the equivalent effect. One 25mg tablet of the pine bark extract gives you about the same effect as 1,000mg of bioflavonoids. The name for the pine bark product is 'Pycnogenol.'     Some Canadian brands carrying bioflavonoids are:    Quest.............1,000mg   big, bitter, not chewable   Swiss Herbal........600mg   smooth, easier swallowing    Jamieson............500mg   medium, bitter, chewable    SISU.................25mg   (Pycnogenol) small, easy swallowing    Give them a try and see what happens.....and good luck!   -- Ron Roth -- ===================================================================== --  Internet: rn.3228@rose.com  -  Rosenet: ron roth@rosehamilton  -- *   "Eating Radium has strange results,"  Tom said brightly.---   RoseReader 2.10  P003228 Entered at [ROSEHAMILTON]   RoseMail 2.10 : Usenet: Rose Media - Hamilton (416) 575-5363

ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.  ########################################################################################   New Program Announcement   ###############################################################################################            JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAMThe Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a newprogram jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon University.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and January 1994.PROGRAM OBJECTIVESThe program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the United States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managersexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities andlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to developlong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.PROGRAM DESIGNTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan andits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGESeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive coursesdesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in arelatively short time.2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTUREA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of thecultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,Sociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiumswill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or research facilities in the United States will be scheduled.3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPANUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japanwill generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.FELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL ASSTIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.

You can live on the diet but you need to up your calories. Where before youhad a pat of butter now you need a medium apple (probably microwavecooked).  Smaller meals but more of them. Not terrific amounts of meat, it'shard to digest anyway. For comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal "last" longer eat pasta orrice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn. Maybesmaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area. Is thebaby still coming up. Is it starting to push or rub under your ribs? Howtight are your clothes. You shouldn't be wearing any clothing that compresses your middle. Be sure not to "suck in" your stomach when sitting, again itwill put pressure on the digestive tract. Try laying on your sides, back,and stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive.Easier on your legs (circulation) as well. You might try letting the baby"turn" or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months.When you are shortwaisted it's easy for that baby to end up right under thediaphram, especially if you have tight abdominal muscles. If I had mysecond one to do over again I think I'd have tried to loosen up since hedidn't turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous.Maybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybeshe just nags all her patients this way. Especially if she's young. But this gallbladder/whatever problem that might be coming up is somethingto be avoided if possible. Nausea, etc. can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy. Myfirst pregnancy was miserable. During the second I had very little trouble.Some articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically betterchance of carrying their baby.

There is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lung disease has become calcified(chest x-rays would show this).  There are side-effects to the use of EDTA because it is not specific for calcium(it also binds other minerals).  I think that there have been some deaths when EDTA chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances that were not detected and corrected.  In animal studies, the best way to remove calcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin C and magnesium(rabbits already synthesize their own vitamin C, the extra vitamin C was given in their diets to help the magnesium displace the calcium from the plaques).The calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probably can be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form.  Most patietns with calcium deposits are found to be deficient in calcium.1. "Magnesium interrationships in ischemic heart disease: A review"   Am J Clin Nutr 27(1):59-79(1974).  Supplementation with    magnesium will prevent clacification of blood vessels. 2. "The importance of magnesium deficiency in cardiovascular     disease" Am. Heart J 94:649-57(1977).  The need to measure the     serum concentration in all patients with heat disease cannot be     overemphasized.  This is a review article.3. "Effect of dietary magnesium on development of atherosclerosis    in cholesterol-fed rabbits" Atherosclerosis 10:732-7(1990).     Magnesium supplementation greatly decreased the formation of    plaques in rabbits feed a diet that had 1% by weight cholesterrol    added to their normal food.Since EDTA will also bind magnesium, I've never really liked it's use for the reversal of athersclerosis or now apparently in emphesema patients.Marty B.

Fordham)      The risk of HIV transmission from an HIV-positive surgeon to  patient is extremely low, provided that the surgeon strictly  adheres to universal infection control procedures, write C.  Fordham von Reyn et al. of the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.  The researchers contacted 2,317 former patients on whom an HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon performed invasive  procedures between January 1, 1978 and June 30, 1992.  The  orthopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after  testing positive for HIV.  A total of 1,174 former patients  underwent HIV testing, representing 50.7 percent of patients on  whom the orthopedic surgeon performed invasive procedures during  the 13.5-year period.  Patients were tested from each year and  from each category of invasive procedure.  All patients were  found to be negative for HIV by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent  assay.  Two former patients reported known HIV infection prior to surgery.  The examination of AIDS case registries and vital  records neglected to detect cases of HIV infection among former  surgical patients.  The estimated cost of the initial patient  notification and testing was $158,000, with the single most  expensive activity being counseling and testing.  This accounted  for 37 percent of the total expense.  The patient notification  and testing were conducted while maintaining the confidentiality  of the orthopedic surgeon who was an active participant in the  planning and execution of the study.  Notifying patients of the  infected surgeon's HIV-status is both disruptive and expensive  and is not routinely recommended, the researchers conclude. \\        =================================================================     "Investigation of Potential HIV Transmission to the Patients of  an HIV-Infected Surgeon" Journal of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol. HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 38Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993269,  No. 14, P. 1795  (Smith Rogers, Audrey et al.)      The risk of HIV transmission during surgery is so remote that it  will be quantified only by gathering data from multiple,  methodologically similar investigations, writes Audrey Smith  Rogers et al. of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine  in Baltimore, Md.  The researchers identified a total of 1,131  persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical  procedures between 1984 and 1990 and for whom the HIV-positive  surgeon was listed as the operating surgeon.  The AIDS case  registries were reviewed for all patients having undergone  invasive procedures and death certificates were obtained.  Among  the 1,131 patients, 101 were dead, 119 had no address, 413 had  test results known, and 498 did not respond to the questionnaire. No study patient name was found in reported AIDS case registries. One newly detected, HIV-positive patient was determined to have  been most probably infected in 1985 during a transfusion.  There  was no HIV transmission in 369 person-hours of surgical exposure, suggesting that HIV transmission to patients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per 1000 person-hours of surgical  exposure.  The researchers determined there is no evidence to  suggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard  infection-control guidelines; over 50 percent of the patients  with invasive procedures chose to be tested, and of those whose  results were revealed, only one person was found to be infected  with HIV.  The study patient's infection was probably the result  of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985.  As a result,  there is no evidence that the transmission of HIV from the  HIV-positive surgeon to any patient transpired, the researchers  conclude.       ==================================================================                                April 20, 1993       ================================================================== "Drug Concerns to Share AIDS Data" New York Times (04/20/93), P. C10  (Kolata, Gina)      A total of 15 major pharmaceutical companies have decided, in a  highly unusual move, to share AIDS drugs and information while  the drugs are undergoing early clinical testing.  Dr. Edward  Scolnick, president of the Merck Research Laboratory in Rahway,  N.J., arranged the collaboration.  He said that cooperation  between companies seemed increasingly significant as it had  become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more  effective in fighting HIV than any drug used alone.  The  researchers are hopeful that HIV, when faced with a combination  of several drugs requiring mutation at different sites for  resistance to develop, will be unable to evolve all the mutations at the same time.  Therefore, several drugs taken together or one after the other could halt the spread of HIV.  Currently, the  drug companies do not know what other drugs their competitors are developing.  The new agreement allows companies to routinely  exchange animal data and safety data on new AIDS drugs.  "An  agreement like this will greatly facilitate HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 39Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993companies' ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a much more  efficient way," said Scolnick.  He also said that the  collaboration would not violate antitrust laws.  In creating the  agreement, Merck spoke frequently to members of AIDS advocacy  groups, including ACT-UP.  Dr. Daniel Hoth, director of the  division on AIDS at the National Institute of Allergy and  Infectious Disease said, "We're delighted to see the  pharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that  increasing the information flow will likely accelerate the  discovery of better compounds for AIDS."

AZT has been used in the United  States in asymptomatic HIV-positive people on the basis that  administration of the drug appeared to abate the decline of  T-cell counts.  However, a report in the Lancet demonstrated that AZT should not be used early in the course of disease.  While the CD4 counts of the 877 people given AZT were consistently greater  than those of patients receiving only placebo, the first three  years of follow-up have shown that the proportions of people in  the two groups progressing to overt AIDS or even to death were  not significantly different at roughly 18 percent.  The  conclusions are that AZT is not an effective AIDS drug in  HIV-infected individuals, and that CD4 cell count may not be a  reliable proxy for the progression to AIDS in infected people.   But nothing is implied by the study of the utility of AZT in the  treatment of those in whom symptoms have already appeared--there  is no case for abandoning that treatment, at least on the  evidence now available.  It is much more alarming that the CD4  count has proven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in HIV infection.  AIDS researchers should acknowledge  HIV is alive from the beginning of infection and turn it into a  workable assay of the progress of disease.  The general  application of such an assay will probably in itself provide a  better understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS, concludes  Maddox.       ================================================================== "Infective and Anti-Infective Properties of Breastmilk From  HIV-1-Infected Women" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 914   (Van de Perre, Philippe et al.)      A vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of  the IgM type in the mother's body fluids could be valuable to  prevent transmission of HIV-1 from mother to child, write  Philippe Van de Perre et al. of the HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 40Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993National AIDS Control Program in Kigali, Rwanda.  The researchers hypothesized that  transmission of HIV-1 through breastmilk could be favored by the  presence of infected cells, by deficiency of anti-infective  substances in breastmilk, or both factors.  A total of 215  HIV-1-infected women were enrolled at delivery in Kigali, Rwanda; milk samples were collected 15 days, 6 months, and 18 months post partum.  HIV-1 IgG, secretory IgA, and IgM were assayed by  western blot, for the latter two after removal of IgG with  protein G.  In the 15-day and 6-month samples, the researchers  sought viral genome in milk cells by double polymerase chain  reaction with three sets of primers (gag, pol, and env).  At 15  days, 6 months, and 18 months post partum, HIV-1 specific IgG was detected in 95 percent, 98 percent, and 97 percent of breastmilk  samples; IgA in 23 percent, 28 percent, and 41 percent; and IgM  in 66 percent, 78 percent, and 41 percent.  In children who  survived longer than 18 months the risk of infection was  associated with lack of persistence of IgM and IgA in their  mothers' milk.  The presence of HIV-1-infected cells in the milk  15 days post partum was strongly predictive of HIV-1 infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis.  The  combination of HIV-1 infected cells in breastmilk and a defective IgM response was the strongest predictor of infection.  IgM and  IgA anti-HIV-1 in breastmilk may protect against postnatal  transmission of HIV, the researchers conclude.       ==================================================================                                    April 21, 1993       ==================================================================    "Firms to Share AIDS Research in Global Venture" Journal of Commerce (04/21/93), P. 7A      A total of fifteen U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies  announced Tuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early-stage AIDS research to hasten the search for combination  therapies to fight HIV infection and AIDS.  The companies said  the unusual move resulted primarily from the increasing  concentration of AIDS research on combination therapies since  realizing that HIV is likely to develop resistance to every  individual AIDS drug.  Edward Scolnick, president of Merck & Co.  Research Laboratories, led the collaborative effort that took a  year of negotiations to come together, said participants.  In  addition to Merck, the other companies involved in the  Inter-Company Collaboration for AIDS Drug Development are  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Burroughs Wellcome, Glaxo Inc.,  Hoffman-La Roche, Eli Lilly & Co., Pfizer Inc., Smithkline  Beecham, AB Astra, Du Pont Merck, Syntex Inc., Boehringer  Ingelheim, Miles Inc., and Sigma-Tau.  The participants said that all companies involved in AIDS drug development they were aware  of had joined the collaboration, and that any company actively  involved in HIV anti-viral development may participate.  Scolnick said the collaborators would most likely meet every couple of  months for a daylong scientific meeting where they will review  for one another their preclinical HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993and early clinical data.  The  American Foundation for AIDS Research (AmFAR) was pleased with  the news of the collaboration, which it hopes will lead to the  development of drug combinations that will reduce viral  resistance.

Following recent  highly publicized reports of health professionals who contracted  HIV, the department issued revised guidelines on the management  of such cases.  Dr. Kenneth Calman, Chief Medical Officer, said  doctors, dentists, nurses, and other health-care workers have an  ethical duty to seek advice if they have been exposed to HIV  infection, including, if appropriate, diagnostic HIV testing.  He said, "Infected health care workers should not perform invasive  procedures that carry even a remote risk of exposing patients to  the virus."

The drug, which contains a synthetic hormone similar to the natural hormone progesterone, protects women from pregnancy for three months per injection. The hormone is injected into the muscle of the arm or buttock where it is released into the bloodstream to prevent pregnancy. It is more than 99 percent effective."This drug presents another long-term, effective option for women to prevent pregnancy," said FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D. "As an injectable, given once every three months, Depo Provera eliminates problems related to missing a daily dose."Depo Provera is available in 150 mg. single dose vials from doctors and clinics and must be given on a regular basis to maintain contraceptive protection. If a patient decides to become pregnant, she discontinues the injections.As with any such products, FDA advises patients to discuss the benefits and risks of Depo Provera with their doctor or other health care professional before making a decision to use it.Depo Provera's effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive studies by the manufacturer, the World Health Organization and health agencies in other countries. U.S. clinical trials, begun in 1963, also found Depo Provera effective as an injectable contraceptive.The most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight gain. In addition, some patients may experience headache, nervousness, abdominal pain, dizziness, weakness or fatigue. The drug should not be used in women who have acute liver disease, unexplained vaginal bleeding, breast cancer or blood clots in the legs, lungs or eyes.The labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing the drug, due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to the drug.

The manufacturer will conduct additional research to study this potential effect.Depo Provera was Developed in the 1960s and has been approved for contraception in many other countries. The UpJohn Company of Kalamazoo, Mich., which will market the drug under the name, Depo Provera Contraceptive Injection, first submitted it for approval in the United States in the 1970s. At that time, animal studies raised questions about its potential to cause breast cancer. Worldwide studies have since found the overall risk of cancer, including breast cancer in humans, to be minimal if any.HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993       New Rules Speed Approval of Drugs for Life-Threatening Illnesses                      P92-37 Food and Drug Administration                        Monica Revelle - (301) 443-4177The Food and Drug Administration today announced that it will soon publish new rules to shed the approval of drugs for patients with serious or life-threatening illnesses, such as AIDS, cancer and Alzheimer's disease. "These final rules will help patients who are suffering the most serious illnesses to get access to new drugs months or even years earlier than would otherwise be possible," said HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, M.D. "The effort to accelerate FDA review for these drugs has been a long-term commitment and indeed a hallmark of this administration." These rules establish procedures for the Food and Drug Administration to approve a drug based on "surrogate endpoints" or markers. They apply when the drug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies. Such endpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not in themselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualified scientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient. Use of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approval earlier than if traditional endpoints -- such as relief of disease symptoms or prevention of disability and death from the disease -- are used. The new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety and effectiveness, based on surrogate endpoints, can be reasonably established. The drug's sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conduct postmarketing human studies to confirm that the drug's effect on the surrogate endpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectiveness. One new drug -- zalcitabine (also called ddC) -- was approved June 19, using a model of this process, for treating the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, the cause of AIDS. Accelerated approval can also be used, if necessary, when FDA determines that a drug, judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease, can be used safely only under a restricted distribution plan. "The new rules will help streamline the drug development and review process without sacrificing goad science and rigorous FDA oversight," said FDA commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D. "While drug approval will be accomplished faster, these drugs and biological products must still meet safety and effectiveness standards required by law."

[NASDAQ: REGN] have discovered that certain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can prevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye. The degeneration of these cells, known as photoreceptors, is a major cause of visual impairment      This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS), holds promise for people who may lose their sight due to progressive retinal degeneration -- currently, no drug treatment for retinal degeneration exists. It is estimated that 2.5 million Americans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and 100,000 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus, a hereditary disease that causes blindness. In addition, each year more than 15,000 people undergo surgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas.      The research was funded in part by the RP (Retinitis Pigmentosa) Foundation Fighting Blindness, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National Eye Institute. It was conducted by Drs. Matthew M. LaVail, Kazuhiko Unoki, Douglas Yasurnura, Michael T. Matthes and Roy H. Steinberg at UCSF, arld Dr. C;eorge Yancoooulos, Regeneron's Vice President for Discovery. Regeneron holds an exclusive license for this research from UCSF.     In the research described in the PNAS , a light-damage model was used to assess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring substances. Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week. Eyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their photoreceptor cells -- the rods and cones of the retina -- after light exposure. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor (CNTF) were particularly effective in this model without causing unwanted side effects; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) were not effective in these experiments.      Discussing the research, Dr. Jesse M. Cedarbaum, Regeneron's Director of Clinical Research, said, "BDNF's ability to rescue neurons in the retina that have been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of vision impairment, and for retinal detachment. Following detachment, permanent vision loss may HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993result frorn the death of detached retinal cells. It is possible that BDNF could play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached surgically."      "Retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the retina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades. Vision decreases to a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness. It is our hope that research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression and preserve useful vision throughout life," stated Jeanette S. Felix, Ph.D., Director of Science for the RP Foundation Fighting Blindness.      In addition to the work described , Regeneron is developing BDNF in conjunction with Aingen Inc. [NASDAQ:AMGN] as a possible treatment for peripheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy, motor neuron diseases, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. By itself, Regeneron is testing CNTF in patients with arnyotrophic lateral sclerosis (commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease).      Regeneron Pharlnaceuticals, Inc., based in Tarrytown, New York, is a leader in the discovery and development of biotechnology-based compounds for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, peripheral neuropathies and nerve injuries, which affect more than seven million Americans. Drs. LaVail and Steinberg of UCSF are consultants to Regeneron.HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 19Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993                 Affluent Diet Increases Risk Of Heart Disease                          Research Resources Reporter                           written by Mary Weideman                                 Nov/Dec 1992                         National Institutes of Health     High-fat, high-calorie diets rapidly increase risk factors for coronary heart disease in native populations of developing countries that have traditionally consumed diets low in fat.  These findings, according to investigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, have serious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing countries.      "This study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and have higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  It shows also the importance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body weight, thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing countries and affluent nations as well," explains principal investigator Dr. William E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University.      Over the past 25 years Dr. Connor and his team have characterized the food and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico, while simultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism.  These native Mexicans number approximately 50,000 and reside in the Sierra Madre Occidental Mountains in the state of Chihuahua.  The Tarahumaras have coupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing.  Probably as a result, coronary heart disease, which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations, is virtually non existent in their culture.  Loosely translated, the name Tarahumara means "fleet of foot," reflecting a tribal passion for betting on "kickball" races, in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more while kicking a machete-carved wooden ball.     The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans, tortillas, and pinole, a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water, together with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables.  The Tara humaras also eat small amounts of game, fish, and eggs.  Their food contains approximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority (69 percent) is of vegetable origin.  Dietician Martha McMurry, a coinvestigator in the study, describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while low in cholesterol and fat.     The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg/ dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels of 72 mg/dl, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg/dl.  All of those values are in the good, low-risk range, according to the researchers.  Elevated cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 20Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993disease.  HDL-cholesterol is considered beneficial.  In previous studies the Tarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease, although able to respond to high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDL-cholesterol.      Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator Maria Teresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission school building near a community hospital in the small village of Sisoguichi.  Food was weighed, cooked, and fed to the study participants under the investigators' direct supervision, ensuring that subjects ate only food stipulated by the research protocol.  Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly, and plasma samples were frozen and shipped to Dr. Connors laboratory for cholesterol, triglyceride, and lipoprotein analyses.  Regular measurements included participant body weight, height, and triceps skin fold thickness.  Thirteen Tarahumaras, five women and eight men, including one adolescent, were fed their native diet for 1 week, followed by 5 weeks of an "affluent" diet.      "In this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40 percent of total calories.  This is the prototype of the holiday diet that many Americans consume a diet high in fat, sugar, and cholesterol, low in fiber," elaborates Dr. Conners. Such dietary characteristics are reflected in the cholesterol-saturation index, or CSI, recently devised research dietitian Sonja Conner working with Dr. Connor.  "The CSI is a single number that incorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in the diet.  CSI indicates the diet's potential to elevate the cholesterol level, particularly the LDL," Dr. Connor explains.  The Tarahumaran diet averages a very low CSI of 20; Dr. Connor's "affluent" diet used in the study ranks a CSI of 149.      The experimental design of this study reflects the importance of establishing baseline plasma lipid levels, typical of the native diet, before exposing subjects to the experimental diet.  The standard curve relating dietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off, or plateau, for consumption of large amounts of fat.  Changes in dietary fat and/or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels.  "You must have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put into the experimental diet.  The Framingham study, for example, did not discriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease because the diet was already high in fat.  All subjects were already eating on a plateau," Dr. Connor says.      After 5 weeks of consuming the "affluent" diet, the subjects' mean plasma cholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent, primarily in the LDL fraction, which rose 39 percent.  HDL-cholesterol increased by 31 per cent, and LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very little.  Plasma triglyceride levels increased by 18 percent, and subjects averaged an 8-pound gain in weight.  According to Dr. Connor, lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon, yielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35 days. HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 21Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993     The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrialized nations.  "We think HDL-cholesterol increased because we increased the amount of dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolic study.  In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietary cholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption.  In the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total calories.  We reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflects the amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary cholesterol.  HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat, and it increased quite a bit in this study," Dr. Connor explains.     Low HDL in the Tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of coronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of fat or cholesterol.  HDL remains an important predictor to Americans because of their usual high fat intake.      Dr. Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than 20 percent of total calories as fat, less than 100 mg of cholesterol, and a CSI around 20, varying in accordance with caloric needs.  Such a diet is low in meat and dairy fat, high in fiber.  Dr. Connor also comments on recent suggestions that Americans adopt a "Mediterranean-style" diet.  "The original Mediterranean diet, in its pristine state, consisted of a very low intake of fat and very few animal and dairy products.  We are already eating a lot of meat and dairy products.  Simply to continue that pattern while switching to olive oil is not going to help the situation."      The World Health Organization (WHO) is focusing much attention on the emergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies undergoing technological development.  Dr. Connor says that coronary heart disease starts with a given society's elite, who typically eat a different diet than the average citizen.  "If the pattern of afluence increases, the entire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease, which places a termendous health care burden on a society.  WHO would like the developing countries to prevent coronary heart disease, so they can concentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public health measures to improve general well-being, rather than paying for unnecessary, expensive medical technology," Dr. Connors says.     "The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move their plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within a very short time by an affluent, excessive diet.  The present rate of coronary heart disease in the United States is 30 percent less than it was 20 years ago, so a lot has been accomplished.  We are changing rapidly," he concludes.HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 22Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::                             General Announcments::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::        Publications for Health Professionals Available from NCI (1/93)Unless otherwise noted, the following materials are provided free of charge by calling the NCI's Publication Ordering Service, 1-800-4-CANCER.

In comparison, in the United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall decreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in gonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of this disease from 1985 through 1992.      In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department of Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992, reported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively (Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics (15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases with race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% of all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by age groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or equal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all reported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the largest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age group-specific rate (639 per 100,000).      Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver metropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the state (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area occurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods considered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity.      When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among men in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in the Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits by males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases diagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised 94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among self-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992, respectively).      Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO, university hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted to determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased 23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the fourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning).      From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and Hispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993increased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado increased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992, the gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for whites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000) (Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from 1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases increased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups. Reported by: KA Gershman, MD, JM Finn, NE Spencer, MSPH, STD/AIDS Program; RE Hoffman, MD, State Epidemiologist, Colorado Dept of Health. JM Douglas, MD, Denver Dept of Health and Hospitals. Surveillance and Information Systems Br, Div of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center for Prevention Svcs, CDC. Editorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992 may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH surveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea cases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact. However, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning laboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population.      One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a recent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs (2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area coincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires further assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) -- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs, and gang affiliation.      The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the national health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective 19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for gonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at greatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race-specific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as socioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors.      In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado, interventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting partner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at increased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black males); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993announcements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in schools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted primarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to perform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational interventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of members of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders and health-care providers.

Child safety seats and safety belts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50 states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety belts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by an estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major cause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for those aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In addition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to use restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between adult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints for the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC analyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this study.      Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to 18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based, random-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury Control and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499 (26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent was asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for that child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in this analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than consistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up). Data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates and confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined by p values of less than 0.05.      Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six (Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no law requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse of safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a safety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993laws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use. The analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law requiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law (no-law states).      Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not consistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and adult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square test) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus 43.2%, respectively).      High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than consistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported high rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age (range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for adults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child-occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% for 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of consistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult safety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age groups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year).      Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded that in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition, higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with increased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated with increased adult safety-belt use (8). Reported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC. Editorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit other risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater risk for motor-vehicle injury (10).      Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with child restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such programs should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve low-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are directed at parents with young children.      Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In addition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993they become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment, those who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do not have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and safety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the highest rate of fatal crashes (5).

SURVEILLANCE FOR AND COMPARISON OF BIRTH DEFECT PREVALENCES                               IN TWO GEOGRAPHIC                         AREAS -- UNITED STATES, 1983-88      Problem/Condition: CDC and some states have developed surveillance systems to monitor the birth prevalence of major defects.      Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillance in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California for the years 1983-1988.      Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program and the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population-based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. The prevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983-1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan Atlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race, sex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression.      Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal alcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the kidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general diagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand limb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these defects are relatively easy to diagnose.      Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However, the reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be related to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene pool, or random variation.      Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several collaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in the birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on the impact of prenatal diagnosis.

INFLUENZA -- UNITED STATES, 1988-89     Problem/Condition: CDC monitors the emergence and spread of new influenza virus variants and the impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality annually from October through May.      Reporting Period Covered: This report covers U.S. influenza surveillance conducted from October 1988 through May 1989.      Description of System: Weekly reports from the vital statistics offices of 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 WHO collaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza viruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and territorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians. Nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received throughout the year.      Results: During the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1) and B viruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency overall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted over the course of the season. Throughout the season increases in the indices of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were similar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of identified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype increased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the 1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were reported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza A(H1N1).      Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of influenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A.      Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced throughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make informed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual surveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates for inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons. Authors: Louisa E.

Copyright 1993, The University of Arizona                 High Tech Assisted Reproductive TechnologiesFollowing the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been developed that include IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT), embryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. Together, these technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive technology (ART) procedures. Ovulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility management. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to proceed with one of the ART procedures. Therefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility service at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in ART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients in the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the traditional therapies. The following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our Center, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the realistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are: o in vitro o fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube   transfer o (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation. This article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed towards improved success of these technologies.

This technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization. There are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by other centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and hemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ hybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit sex-linked disorders. The considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth of affected children.

In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our Assisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of unfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and the culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred to the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being processed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993assisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to perform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically stimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo lupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs obtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia, we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our Infertility Unit, with the patient sedated.       Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal deficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male factor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall success rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per cycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 IVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate.      Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well recognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous ovarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle attempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant of conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an Assisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of traditional therapies.      The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not been clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs available for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; and 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our Center, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may be impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently, the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy.      GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room, usually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian tube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization occurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF, with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for transfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993which there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility and/or idiopathic infertility.         The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990 indicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained with the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36 percent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might expect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our program we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while substantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the patient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing a procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing general anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs, and the developmental competency of resultant embryos.      The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial environment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT cycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent.      Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when embryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos. This procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for success at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated by the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from both a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys.      Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new, is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but who have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in combination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10 percent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the procedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under the coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm through enzymatic digestion.      Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 percent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm. Therefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to establish conception.

OCD is often associated with certain forms of depression.  Examples of obsessive thoughts are repeated impulses to kill a lovedone (though not accompanied by anger), or a religious person having recurrent blasphemous thoughts.  Generally, the individual attempts to ignoreor suppress the intrusive thoughts by engaging in other activities.  The individual realizes that the thoughts originate from the own mind, ratherthan being from an external source.Examples of compulsive actions are constant repetitive hand washing,or other activity that is not realistically related to alleviating asource of the anxiety.In OCD, the obsessions or compulsions are highly distressing to theindividual, take an hour or more per day, and significantly impair theirdaily routine and social relationships.Treatments include psychotherapy, behavioral methods, and sometimescertain anti-depressants which have recently been found effective in alleviatingobsessions and compulsions.The standard diagnostic code for OCD, if you want to look it up in theDSM-III manual of psychiatric diagnosis is 300.30 .kind regards,todd+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+| Todd I.

The Seattle-based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution.  The actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed unsafe under federal air quality laws.       "People with asthma have inflamed airways, and airborne particles tend to exacerbate that inflammation," said Joel Schwartz, Ph.D., of the Environmental Protection Agency, who was the lead author of the study.  "When people are on the threshold of having, a serious asthma attack, particles can push them over the edge."      The Seattle Study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visits with daily levels of PM,,,. or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 microns or less.  These finer particles are considered hazardous because they are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out of compliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10 exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.       In Seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at levels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30 microgram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone with asthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent.       The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory Disease, an official journal of the American Thoracic Society, the Lung Association's medical section.       The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  A 1992 study by Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery, Ph.D., of Harvard found that particles may be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States.  Other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms and bronchitis in children.       "Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone," says Dr. Schwartz.  "But more and more research is showing that particles are bad actors as well."      One problem in setting, standards for particulate air pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.  Unlike other regulated pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complex and varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, and HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 29Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993acid aerosols.       "Researchers can't Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects of particulate air pollution," says Dr. Schwartz.  "We have no way of duplicating the typical urban mix of particles.  " Consequently, most of what is known about particulates has been learned through population-based research like the Seattle study.       Given that the EPA's current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur dioxide standards, the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard any time soon.  Until changes are made, there appears to be little people with asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles.     "In some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports only cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and that's rarely particulate matter," says Dr.  Schwartz.  "However, PM10 doesn't have to be near its violation range to be unhealthy."HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 30Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993               NIH Consensus Development Conference on MelanomaThe National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on Diagnosis and Treatment of Early Melanoma brought together experts in dermatology, pathology, epidemiology, public education, surveillance techniques, and potential new technologies as well as other health care professionals and the public to address (1) the clinical and histological characteristics of early melanoma; (2) the appropriate diagnosis, management, and followup of patients with early melanoma; (3) the role of dysplastic nevi and their significance; and (4) the role of education and screening in preventing melanoma morbidity and mortality.  Following 2 days of presentations by experts and discussion by the audience, a consensus panel weighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement.  Among their findings, the panel recommended that (1) melanoma in situ is a distinct entity effectively treated surgically with 0.5 centimeter margins; (2) thin invasive melanoma, less than 1 millimeter thick, has the potential for long-term survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgical excision with a 1 centimeter margin; (3) elective lymph node dissections and extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma; (4) patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high risk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely; (5) some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for melanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs; and (6) education and screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality from melanoma.

Within the program, there are four types of cancer centers:  basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarily in basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus on clinical research; "comprehensive" cancer centers (28), which emphasize a multidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community outreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancer prevention and control research.  Although some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was the National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new cancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones.  The passage of the act also dramatically transformed the centers' structure and broadened the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and cancer control research.  Over the next two decades, the centers' program grew progressively.  In 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Today, there are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific NCI criteria for comprehensive status.  To attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center, an institution must pass rigorous peer review.  Under guidelines newly established in 1990, the eight criteria for "comprehensiveness" include the requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in several scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong program of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings into clinical practice.  Moreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly beyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (also referred to as a P30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting the infrastructure of a cancer center's operations.  These criteria encompass strong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials, significant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important outreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of sources.  The other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit important new findings or address timely research questions.  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 32Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993Of the 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centers, 14 are of the basic science type.  These centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications from new discoveries in the laboratory.  Clinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and clinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their overall research programs.  There are 12 such centers today.  Finally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and control research.  These centers interface with state and local public health departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions responsible for implementing population-wide public health programs.  Consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials.  Together, the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through interdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from the laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice.

Specifically, we are interested in establishing this site as a clearinghouse for personally developed software that has been developed for local medical education programs.  We welcome all contributions that may be shared with other users.  To connect to the UCI Medical Education Software Repository, ftp to:                      FTP.UCI.EDUThe Repository currently offers both MSDOS and Macintosh software, and we hope to support other operating systems (UNIX, MUMPS, AMIGA?).  Uploads are welcome.  We actively solicit information and software which you have personaly developed or have found useful in your local medical education efforts, either as an instructor or student.  Once you have connected to the site via FTP, cd (change directory) to either the med-ed/mac/incoming or the med-ed/msdos/incoming directories, change the mode to binary and "send" or "put" your files.  Note that you won't be able to see the files with the "ls" or "dir" commands.  Please compress your files as appropriate to the operating system (ZIP for MSDOS; Compactor or something similar for Macintosh) to save disk space.  After uploading, please send email to Steve Clancy (slclancy@uci.edu) (for MSDOS) or Albert Saisho (saisho@uci.edu) (for MAC) describing the file(s) you have uploaded and any other information we might need to describe it.Note that we can only accept software or information that has been designated as shareware, public-domain or that may otherwise be distributed freely.  Please do not upload commercial software!  Doing so may jeopardize the existence of this FTP site.  If you wish to upload software for other operating systems, please contact either Steve Clancy, M.L.S. or Albert Saisho, M.D. at the addresses above.HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 40Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::                              AIDS News Summaries::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::                              AIDS Daily SummaryThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National AIDS  Clearinghouse makes available the following information as a public  service only.

The decision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to test a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes of Health, which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  Health and  Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on the therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday.  Companies including Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and  Immuno AG have already told NIH that they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  The testing is intended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the  replication of HIV in patients already infected.  Shalala refuted last week's reports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Army's test of the MicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time.  "The report was inaccurate,  and I expect there to be some announcement in the next 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project," said Shalala.   Administration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr. Bernadine Healy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had convinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be tested simultaneously.  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test of multiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two years.==================================================================    HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993"The Limits of AZT's Impact on HIV" U.S. News & World Report (04/12/93) Vol. 114, No. 14, P. 18      AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.   Burroughs Wellcome, the manufacturer of AZT, made $338 million  last year alone from sales of the drug.  However, a team of  European researchers recently reported that although HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk of  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment, that benefit  disappeared two years later.  The Lancet published preliminary  findings of the three-year study, which could give more reason  for critics to argue the drug's cost, side effects, and general  efficacy.  Even though U.S. researchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials, many argue the European  researchers' suggestion that HIV-positive patients experience  little improvement in their illness before the development of  AIDS symptoms.
