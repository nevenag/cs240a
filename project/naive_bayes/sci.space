It it intended mainly for use with these disks and should notbe considered a general imaging application.  Future versions will correctthis.Features include:             *  Read compressed images directly from disk.  No preprocessing                required!             *  Basic image processing functions such as low and high pass                filtering, zoom, rotate, flip, and much, much more!             *  Complete customizable filter kernels.  Write your own                filters if you don't like those provided with program.             *  Reseau mark removal.  Get rid of unsightly reseau marks                with the click of a button.             *  It's Freeware!  Give it to your best friend, give it to                your mother-in-law, give it to your dog, I just don't care!MediaThe Image Machine has been tested with the following CDROMs:             *  Voyagers to the Outer Planets, Vol. 1 - 12             *  Mission To Mars: Viking Orbiter Images of Mars, Vol.  1 - 8             *  Mars Mosaicked Digital Image Model, Vol. 1 - 6             *  Mission To Jupiter: Galileo Images of Venus, Earth, & Moon,                Vol. 2 - 6             *  Magellan MIDR CDROMs (tested with only select images)It should be compatible with most images stored in PDS and VICAR format,but unless the image belongs to one of the above sets, it hasn't beentested.Requirements             *  80386SX processor or above (20+MHz preferred)             *  4 MB RAM, the more the better.             *  Microsoft Window 3.1+AvailabilityThe Image Machine can be found on ames.arc.nasa.gov under pub/SPACE/SOFTWAREas imach10.zip.  I've also submitted it to comp.binaries.ms-windows soif you don't have ftp access, wait a few days and it should appear at yoursite.DisclaimerThe Image Machine is a private project written by myself in my spare time.I am in no way associated with the National Space Science Data Centeror NASA and this project should not be consider endorsed by them.Thanks to Peter Yee for placing it on the ames archives.Questions or comments should be mailed to me directly at:edm@twisto.compaq.com.--Ed McCreary                                               ,__oedm@twisto.compaq.com                                   _-\\_<, "If it were not for laughter, there would be no Tao."

Vista Pro 3 has been ported to the PCs.CIA World Map II----------------[  NOTE: this database is quite out of date, and not topologically structured.  If you need a standard for world cartographic data, wait for the  Digital Chart of the World. This 1:1M database has been produced from  the Defense Mapping Agency's ONCs and will be available, together with  searching and viewing software, on a number of CD-ROMs later this summer. ]  Check into HANAUMA.STANFORD.EDU and UCSD.EDU (see ftp list above)  The CIA database consists of coastlines, rivers and political boundaries  in the form of line strokes. Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360  array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for  every half degree longitude and latitude.   A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine  pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).  There's another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and  builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as  polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask  Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.  The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.  (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact, you'll have to  compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package.NCAR data---------  NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of  terrain  data, ranging from elevation datasets at  various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc.  This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending  on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape,  IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available).  Their data archive  is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented.  For more information,  email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu.UNC data tapes with voxel data--------------  There are 2 "public domain" tapes with data for the comparison and  testing of various volume rendering algorithms (mainly MRI and CT  scans). These tapes are distributed by the SoftLab of UNC @ Chapel Hill.  (softlab@cs.unc.edu)  The data sets (volume I and II) are also available via anonymous FTP from  omicron.cs.unc.edu [128.109.136.159] in pub/softlab/CHVRTDNASA----  Many US agencies such as NASA publish CD-ROMs with many altimetry data  from various space missions, eg. Viking for Mars, Magellan for Venus,  etc. Especially for NASA, I would suggest to call the following  address for more info:     National Space Science Date Center     Goddard Space Flight Center     Greenbelt, Maryland 20771     Telephone: (301) 286-6695     Email address:  request@nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov  The data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online.  Internet users can telnet to nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov (128.183.10.4) and log  in as 'NODIS' (no password).  You can also dial in at (301)-286-9000 (300, 1200, or 2400 baud, 8 bits,  no parity, one stop). At the "Enter Number:" prompt, enter MD and  carriage return. When the system responds "Call Complete," enter a few  more carriage returns to get the "Username:" and log in as 'NODIS' (no  password).  NSSDCA is also an anonymous FTP site, but no comprehensive list of  what's there is available at present.Earth Sciences Data-------------------  There's a listing of anonymous FTP sites for earth science data, including  imagery. This listing is called "Earth Sciences Resources on Internet",  and you can get it via anonymous FTP from csn.org [128.138.213.21]  in the directory COGS under the name "internet.resources.earth.sci"  Some sites include:  aurelie.soest.hawaii.edu [128.171.151.121]: pub/avhrr/images - AVHRR images  ames.arc.nasa.gov [128.102.18.3]: pub/SPACE/CDROM  - images from        Magellan and Viking missions etc.        pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the whole        archive (the index is about 200K by itself). There's also an        e-mail server for the people without Internet access: send a letter        to archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the        subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:        send SPACE Index        send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91        (Capitalization is important! Only text files are handled by the        email server at present)  vab02.larc.nasa.gov [128.155.23.47]: pub/gifs/misc/landsat -Landsat photos in GIF and JPEG format[ It was shut down - nfotis; anyone has a copy of this archive?? ]Others------  Daily values of river discharge, streamflow, and daily weather data is  available from EarthInfo, 5541 Central Ave., Boulder CO  80301.

Background imagery/textures/datafiles========================================= First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTPlist above.24-bit scanning:----------------  Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for  speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :  scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll  house supplies.  So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have  scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.Books with textures:--------------------  Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.  Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also  a wide variety of stock art is available.  Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,  UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.  In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books  for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your  graphics work. Their address is:Edition Belvedere Co.

Introduction to rendering algorithms========================================a. Ray-Tracing:---------------  I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read  some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would  suggest:   An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press     1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4  Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong  using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines  (erich@eye.com)There's a more concise reference also:  Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: "An Introduction to Ray Tracing", in  "Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,  NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer)--------------------------A good reference is:        _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,        McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.c. Others:----------???[ More info is needed -- nfotis ]========================================================================15. Where can I find the geometric data for the:================================================a. Teapot ?-----------"Displays on Display" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the wholestory about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also hasthe bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframemodel of the teapot.IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column "Jim Blinn's Corner" describesan another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations forexample are used.The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to getthem to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles ata specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch).The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs atessellation at any specified resolution.b. Space Shuttle ?------------------Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttledatafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):model1:A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.)389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex).Payload doors non-existent.Units: unknown.Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy.

He didnot mention any restriction on the model's distribution.model4:The NASA model.The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers,defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:<x offset> <y offset> <z offset>From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions3473 vertices.2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex, 10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex, 17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex).Payload doors closed.Units: inches.Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the modelProprietary info: unknownmodel5:The old shuttle model.The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.104 vertices.452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex).Payload doors open.Units: meters.We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, forsome years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisorScott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.========================================================================16. Image annotation software=============================a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a  rasterfile.b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not  sure exactly what they are.  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based  graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and  two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based  toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,  pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed  tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation  instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).  A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for  SPARC systems is also available for ftp.  All software is the property of Columbia University and may not  be redistributed without permission.  ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that  allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of  PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging  routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the   position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen   color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many  of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as  export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest  X11 archive.========================================================================17.

The Explorer  GUI allows users to build custom applications without having to write  any, or a minimal amount of, traditonal code. Also, existing code can  be easily integrated into the Explorer environment. Explorer currently  is available now on SGI and Cray machines, but will become available on  other platforms in time. [ Bundled with every new SGI machine, as far as  I know]  See comp.graphics.explorer or comp.sys.sgi for discussion of the package.

A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,  synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.  WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming  environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their  imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware  developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their  own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers  (specialized hardware). WIT runs on Sun, HP9000/7xx, SGI and supports  Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

This was  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL  or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general  purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a  freebie if you want it"  "My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which  that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical  image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.)

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets   comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars,   menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability   of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an   encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap   manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted  to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only   color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets   developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget   set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers   using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other   Motif widgets.  FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)   simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these  simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these  data graphically.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)===================================================GRASS-----  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,  although it is reported to have significant image processing  capabilities.  Feature Descriptions  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software." A first review  of  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68  Host Configuration Requirements  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented  in raster (grid-cell) form.  Availability  CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.  This location will be the new "canonical" source for GRASS software, as  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and  "tar" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John  Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu  Support  Listserv mailing lists:  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in  Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the  community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,  we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass  through the list.  If you have questions, problems, or comments, send  E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.Microstation Imager-------------------  Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS  software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.  Feature Description  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available  for GIS applications.  Host Configuration Requirements  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.PCI---  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of  remote sensing data in eight or ten different "industry standard"  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.  The "PCI software" consists of several classes/groups/packages of  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common "PCI  database" disk file.  The "Tape I/O" package is a set of utility  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the "PCI database" file;  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.  "multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5"), and  God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't  use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your  particular application/interest calls for.  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight "parameters," read from  a common "parameter file" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your "default  directory."  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI  data structures (database file, parameter file).  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the  Macintosh calls "raw") data from tape, in a number of different  "interleave" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the  graphic-arts industry's "CT2T" format, would probably (I haven't tried)  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start  over.  It's worth noting that the PCI "database" file is designed to  contain not only "raster" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this  can go into the PCI "database").  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would  display directly from a PCI "database" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be "overkill"  in your case; it seems designed for the very "high end"  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these  areas.SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)--------------------------------  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X  for display.MAP II------  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.CLRview-------  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports  the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,  TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.  CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129)   in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.

If you need a standard for world cartographic data, wait for the  Digital Chart of the World. This 1:1M database has been produced from  the Defense Mapping Agency's ONCs and will be available, together with  searching and viewing software, on a number of CD-ROMs later this summer. ]  Check into HANAUMA.STANFORD.EDU and UCSD.EDU (see ftp list above)  The CIA database consists of coastlines, rivers and political boundaries  in the form of line strokes. Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360  array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for  every half degree longitude and latitude.   A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine  pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).  There's another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and  builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as  polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask  Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.  The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.  (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact, you'll have to  compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package.NCAR data---------  NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of  terrain  data, ranging from elevation datasets at  various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc.  This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending  on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape,  IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available).  Their data archive  is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented.

Background imagery/textures/datafiles========================================= First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTPlist above.24-bit scanning:----------------  Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for  speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :  scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll  house supplies.  So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have  scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.Books with textures:--------------------  Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.  Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also  a wide variety of stock art is available.  Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,  UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.

Introduction to rendering algorithms========================================a. Ray-Tracing:---------------  I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read  some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would  suggest:   An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press     1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4  Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong  using his book.

Image annotation software=============================a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a  rasterfile.b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not  sure exactly what they are.  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based  graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and  two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based  toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,  pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed  tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation  instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).  A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for  SPARC systems is also available for ftp.  All software is the property of Columbia University and may not  be redistributed without permission.  ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that  allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of  PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging  routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the   position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen   color from a pull-down menu.

A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,  synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.  WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming  environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their  imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware  developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their  own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers  (specialized hardware).

This was  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL  or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general  purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a  freebie if you want it"  "My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which  that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical  image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.)

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets   comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars,   menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability   of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an   encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap   manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted  to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only   color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets   developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget   set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers   using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other   Motif widgets.  FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)   simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these  simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these  data graphically.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)===================================================GRASS-----  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,  although it is reported to have significant image processing  capabilities.  Feature Descriptions  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software." A first review  of  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68  Host Configuration Requirements  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented  in raster (grid-cell) form.  Availability  CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.  This location will be the new "canonical" source for GRASS software, as  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and  "tar" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John  Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu  Support  Listserv mailing lists:  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in  Champaign, IL).

Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.  Feature Description  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available  for GIS applications.  Host Configuration Requirements  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.PCI---  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of  remote sensing data in eight or ten different "industry standard"  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.  The "PCI software" consists of several classes/groups/packages of  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common "PCI  database" disk file.  The "Tape I/O" package is a set of utility  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the "PCI database" file;  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.  "multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5"), and  God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't  use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your  particular application/interest calls for.  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight "parameters," read from  a common "parameter file" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your "default  directory."  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI  data structures (database file, parameter file).  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the  Macintosh calls "raw") data from tape, in a number of different  "interleave" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the  graphic-arts industry's "CT2T" format, would probably (I haven't tried)  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start  over.  It's worth noting that the PCI "database" file is designed to  contain not only "raster" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this  can go into the PCI "database").  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would  display directly from a PCI "database" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be "overkill"  in your case; it seems designed for the very "high end"  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these  areas.SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)--------------------------------  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X  for display.MAP II------  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.CLRview-------  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports  the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,  TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.  CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129)   in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.

 92Some time ago I sent the following message:   Every once in a while I design an orbital space colony.  I'm gearing up to   do another one.  I'd some info from you. If you were to move   onto a space colony to live permanently, how big would the colony have   to be for you to view a permanent move as desirable?  Specifically,   How many people do you want to share the colony with?    What physical dimensions does the living are need to have?     Assume 1g living (the colony will rotate).  Assume that you can leave   from time to time for vacations and business trips.  If you're young   enough, assume that you'll raise your children there.I didn't get a lot of responses, and they were all over the block.Thanx muchly to all those who responded, it is good food for thought.Here's the (edited) responses I got:   How many people do you want to share the colony with? 100   What physical dimensions does the living are need to have?

As a more specific rule of thumb, big enoughfor there to be places at least an hour away on foot.  Call that5km, which means a 10km circumference if we're talking a sphere.

 31Message-ID: <1qn4bgINN4s7@mimi.UU.NET>NNTP-Posting-Host: mimi.uu.net  Background: The Orion spacedrive was a theoretical concept.  Itwould be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft.The idea was that you'd detonate devices with somewhere from one toten megatons yield behind a "pusher plate" attached to the mainspacecraft.  The shock wave from the explosions would transfermomentum to the ship.  Now, in an atmosphere I can see this.  The energy of the explosionheats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock waveinto the pusher plate.  But in a vacuum, only two things I can see aregoing to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium, krypton,helium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagneticradiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fissionproducts).  Would this work?  I can't see the EM radiation impelling very muchmomentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate), and it seemsto me you're going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombsout the back of the ship than you get from detonating them oncethey're there.  I must be missing something.  Would someone enlighten me via email?  Thanks.-- --Jim---Jim Goltz                    AlterNet Engineer               goltz@uunet.uu.net

 40We`ve had the the Great Western, the [ dunno ] and the Great Northernpostulated as Brunel`s masterpiece. Keep boxing the compass chaps, you`llget round to it eventually.The Great Western was a highly successful transatlantic mail ship,with hybrid sail and steam propulsion. The Great Eastern, which brokethe 'Little Giant' financially and otherwise, was a revolutionary leapforward in ship design. A thirty thousand ton all steel vessel, withprimary steam propulsion, it was at the time easily the biggest oceangoing vessel ever built. Brunel took advantage of the fact that cargoand / or fuel capacity rose with the cube of scale, while drag rosewith the square, so a really big ship could steam thousands of mileswithout coaling.Unfortunately, there was no real market for such a beast at the time,and it was eventually sold off at scrap values. As another postersaid, it then went on to a successful career as a telegraph cablelaying ship. It was in fact the only ship of its day capable of layinga transatlantic cable in one go, with the endurance and capacity tocarry the huge reel all the way, and the manoeuverabilty to dredge fordefective sections. See Arthur C Clarke`s book "How the World was One"[ I think that`s right ]If that`s how the Shuttle goes down in history, as a technical triumphand a financial disaster for the builder, it would not be entirelyignoble, but I doubt if history will be so charitable.  Its true theShuttle can do things no other launch system can do, but are theyworth doing? With low cost access to space, you could have anaffordable space station for doing shuttle-like extended mannedmissions. As it is, the shuttle is not so much a space-truck as aspace-RV, ( only not so cheap to run :-( )-- __._____.___._____.__._________________________________________________________|_. ._| ._|_._._|__| Peter Card, Joint European Torus, Abingdon    | | | |_. | |    | Oxfordshire OX14 3EA UK. tel 0235-464867 FAX 464404    | | |  _| | |    | email pjc@jet.uk or compuserve 100010,366   ._| | | |_. | |    | It wasnt me.

 71------- Blind-Carbon-CopyTo: spacenews@austen.rand.org, cti@austen.rand.orgSubject: White House outlines options for station, Russian cooperationDate: Tue, 06 Apr 93 16:00:21 PDTFrom: Richard Buenneke <buenneke@austen.rand.org>4/06/93:  GIBBONS OUTLINES SPACE STATION REDESIGN GUIDANCENASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C.April 6, 1993RELEASE:  93-64        Dr.  John H.  Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and TechnologyPolicy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on theRedesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidanceto the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the spacestation.        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and ahigh option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Eachoption would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscalyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, researchoperations support, transition cost and also must include adequate programreserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASAbudget for the President's new technology investment.  As a result,station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsettingreductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space stationoption of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASAbudget over the next 5 years.        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session ofthe advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused uponadministrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They alsoreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process theStation Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisorycommittee to consider.        Gibbons also announced that the United States and itsinternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- havedecided, after consultation, to give "full consideration" to use ofRussian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in theredesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesignteam can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIRand the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise ofthe Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  Theoverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducingstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achievingthat goal.        Gibbons reiterated that, "President Clinton is committed to theredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve thescience, the technology and the jobs that the space station programrepresents.

Maybe a special congrete or maybethe same material as makes caplets but with some changes (saw where someoneinstea dof water put beer in the caplet mixture, got a mix that was just asstrong as congret but easier to carry around and such..)Sorry for any spelling errors, I missed school today..

I not familiar with the ad you are speaking ofbut knowing Popular Science it is probably on the fringe.  However, youmay be speaking of "Public Missle, Inc.", which is a legitimate companythat has been around for a while.Due to advances in composite fuels, engines are now available for modelrockets using similar composites to SRB fuel, roughly 3 times more powerful than black powder motors.  They are even available in a reloadableform, i.e. aluminum casing, end casings, o-rings (!).  The engines rangefrom D all the way to M in common manufacture, N and O I've heard ofused at special occasions.To be a model rocket, however, the rocket can't contain any metal structural parts, amongst other requirements.  I've never heard of amodel rocket doing 50,000.  I have heard of > 20,000 foot flights.These require FAA waivers (of course!).  There are a few large nationallaunches (LDRS, FireBALLS), at which you can see many > K sized engineflights.  Actually, using a > G engine constitutes the area of "HighPower Rocketry", which is seperate from normal model rocketry.  Purchaseof engines like I have been describing require membership in the NationalAssociation of Rocketry, the Tripoli Rocketry Assoc., or you have tobe part of an educational institute or company involved in rocketry.Amatuer rocketry is another area.  I'm not really familiar with this,but it is an area where metal parts are allowed, along with liquid fuelsand what not.  I don't know what kind of regulations are involved, butI'm sure they are numerous.High power rocketry is very exciting!

 29The difficulties of a high Isp OTV include:Long transfer times (radiation damage from VanAllen belts for both the spacecraft and OTVArcjets or Xenon thrusters require huge amounts of power so you haveto have either nuclear power source (messy, dangerous and source ofradiation damage) or BIG solar arrays (sensitive to radiation, or heavy)that make attitude control and docking a big pain.If you go solar, you have to replace the arrays every trip, withcurrent technology. Nuclear power sources are strongly restrictedby international treaty.Refueling (even for very high Isp like xenon) is still required and]turn out to be a pain.You either have to develop autonomous rendezvous or long range teleoperationto do docking or    ( and refueling) .You still can't do much plane change because the deltaV required is so high!The Air Force continues to look at doing things this way though. I supposethey are biding their time till the technology becomes available andthe problems get solved.  Not impossible in principle, but hard todo and marginally cheaper than one shot rockets, at least today.Just a few random thoughts on high Isp OTV's. I designed one once...

Considering the confusing spitting contest over 'rights', (there are TOO inalienable rights damn it!  The majority can be just as destructive of liberty as a despot), I suspect that my post did not get out of my site.    (I ain't saying that dark skies are included in these rights, although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them.) Anyway, here are my thoughts on this: I'd like to add that some of the "protests" do not come from a strictly practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for research activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief in an afterlife.  The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels (or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains one weekend, "getting away from it all" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 miles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters much either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't fouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever - like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  If ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a lastbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at 8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved. Regards, Wm. Hathaway Baltimore MD (P.S. added Tuesday - this again is not a rights/vs./reality tome, just a warning that someone into destroying beauty had better know that other people may not accept it without a complaint.)
 38News-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41Sorry, I've lost track of who asked the question originally (our news server at GSFC keeps things around for tremendouslyshort periods of time), but wanted to be certain before Ireplied. Someone asked about displaying the compressed imagesfrom the Voyager imaging CD-ROMs on a Mac. As Peter Ford (MIT)pointed out, a decompression program is available via FTP.(Sorry, I don't remember the name of the node offhand, although it's .mit.edu.) In any case, though, one of the MACdisplay programs (CD ROM Browser by Dana Swift) does displaythe compressed images directly. The program is shareware andis distributed by NSSDC for nominal reproduction costs ($9 +shipping, if memory serves). This does *not* cover theshareware price which should go to Dana for his diligent workand upgrades, however.To request current pricing information, information aboutavailable display software, catalogs, or data from NSSDC,contact our user support office at:National Space Science Data CenterCoordinated Request and User Support Office (CRUSO)Mail Code 633NASA/Goddard Space Flight CenterGreenbelt, MD   20771Phone: (301) 286-6695Fax:   (301) 286-4952+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+|  Dr. Edwin V.

That doesn't include the cradle thatwould have been in the cargo bay when it was deployed.  Spacelab-J on STS-47was 21,861 lbs (according to the press-kit). As someone else pointed out if they had been unable to deploy it for somereason that would have had to land with it still in the cargo bay and thiswas a planned for contingency.

April 23, 1993(Phone:  202/358-1780)Kyle HerringJohnson Space Center, Houston(Phone:  713/483-5111)RELEASE:  93-76HUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYSThe December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS-61 toservice the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been scheduled as an 11 daymission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capabilityfor an additional two, if needed.The decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or EVAs, wasreached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver timesrequired using the Shuttle's robot arm based on software simulations and actualEVA tasks on previous missions."Basically what we've done by going to five EVAs rather than three isto repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to thedynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks," Mission Director Randy Brinkley said."It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing addedflexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations."In laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of thespacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arraysand the Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and installing the CorrectiveOptics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) are priority objectivesduring the mission."When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest throughlowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays,WF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for eachspacewalk, five EVAs were deemed appropriate," said Milt Heflin, Lead FlightDirector for the mission.While the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of twoalternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew thanprevious missions requiring two, three or four EVAs."We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previousspacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs,"Heflin said.  "In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary toformulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possibleto accomplish the mission objectives."Planning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessionsthat include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integratedsimulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  In addition, many stand aloneunderwater training "runs" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.Various refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will bemade based on actual training experience during the months prior to themission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flightwill be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.Endeavour's June flight and Discovery's July mission both will includespacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission.The evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between theactual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks atthe Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center,Huntsville, Ala.Also, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gainingfurther insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand theexperience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers andtrainers.Designed to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built withgrapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.The telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.  At thattime the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may havebecome necessary.- end -     ___    _____     ___    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

TRIAD, the first drag-free satellite, was designed and built by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and launched 2 Sept 1972.  The satellite was in three sections separated by two booms.  The central section housed the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System, which consisted of a proof mass of special non-magnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity.  The proof mass flew a true gravitational orbit, free from drag and radiation pressure.  Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered around the proof mass, thereby flying the entire satellite drag free.     TRIAD was one of the APL-designed Navy Navigation Satellites.  The 2nd-generation operational navigation satellites flying today (NOVA) use a single-axis version of DISCOS.  TRIAD was also the sixth APL satellite to be powered by an RTG (APL flew the first nuclear power supply in space, in 1961).     Further info on TRIAD, DISCOS, etc. can be found in "Spacecraft Design Innovations in the APL Space Department," Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest, Vol. 13, No. 1 (1992).                                                      --Eric Hoffman

 310Archive-name: space/introLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:10 $    FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON SCI.SPACE/SCI.ASTRO    INTRODUCTION    This series of linked messages is periodically posted to the Usenetgroups sci.space and sci.astro in an attempt to provide good answers tofrequently asked questions and other reference material which is worthpreserving. If you have corrections or answers to other frequently askedquestions that you would like included in this posting, send email toleech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).    If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' toyour KILL file for this group (if you're not reading this with a newsreaderthat can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck).    The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed downby rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available inthe Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.    Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. Thepoint of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing oldanswers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressingthan rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are providedbecause they give more complete information than any short generalization.    Questions fall into three basic types:    1) Where do I find some information about space?    Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask    for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There    are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended    discussion.    2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?    Hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been    thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for    evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.    3) Miscellanous queries.    These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of    FAQ postings.    SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE    Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet.    Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]    Edit "Subject:" lines, especially if you're taking a tangent.    Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth100 posts).    Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUESTnot SPACE.    Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check allreferences.)    Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you'reresponding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!    Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mailor article), state your institution, etc. Don't assume the'reply' function of mailers will work.    Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don't post what everyonewill get on TV anyway.    Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping:keep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals(use carriage returns).

 51          Introducing the Back to the Moon in Congress:                          The Next Step                                  The next key hurdle for the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act is introduction of the Act in Congress. At this point,  manycongresspersons have been approached about the bill. However,for a successful effort to pass the bill, we need the bestpossible congressperson to introduce the bill. Due to hisposition as Chair of the House Committee on Space and Science,Congressman George Brown is the logical choice. He has a longrecord of support and interest in space development, and helpedpass the Launch Services Purchase Act and the Space SettlementsAct.                              There is a small group of activists in southern California who have assisted George Brown in his recent re-election campaigns.We are mobilizing this group to have them tell Congressman Brownabout the Back to the Moon bill. We are also asking pro-spaceconstituents to let him know that they care about gettingAmerica back to the Moon.        Finally, there is a good chance that a nationwide alert for space activists to call or write George Brown to have himintroduce the Back to the Moon bill may be staged during latespring, 1993.        All this should produce a positive reaction from Brown'soffice. As more is known, it will be passed on.        However, even if we are successful in getting him to supportthe bill,  this alone will not ensure passage of the bill. Forany bill to become law, one of three conditions must exist:either the bill must reflect widespread national support for anissue (such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits); bepropelled by high-priced lobbyists (we're out of luck there); orhave widespread support within Congress, due to small, butwidespread, constituent support. The latter is the path that we,by necessity, must choose.                            This means that the introduction of the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act must be immediately accompanied by a large numberof congresspersons' sponsorship of the bill.  To accomplishthis, we need activists to ask their congressperson to supportthe Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act - now. To wait until thebill is introduced is simply too late - it takes time to have acongressperson's staff review a bill.        If your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yetintroduced, please elicit their opinion of the bill as currentlywritten.

 62Press Release No.19-93Paris, 22 April 1993Users of ESA's Olympus satellite report on the outcome oftheir experiments"Today Europe's space telecommunications sector would notbe blossoming as it now does, had OLYMPUS not provideda testbed for the technologies and services of the 1990s". Thissummarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300participants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held inSeville on 20-22-April 1993. The conference was organised bythe European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre forthe Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI).OLYMPUS has been particularly useful :-      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of       new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small       antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested       data transmission, videoconferencing, business television,       distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few       examples.-      in opening the door to new telecommunications services       which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower-       frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over       Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band.-      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS       received for the first time in Europe, over several months,       high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and       then distributed it to various centres in Europe.When OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was theworld's largest telecommunications satellite; and no othersatellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining fourdifferent payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.OLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to someof the world's largest businesses. Access to the satellite isgiven in order to test new telecommunications techniques orservices; over the past four years some 200 companies andorganisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learningorganisation.As the new technologies and services tested by theseOLYMPUS users enter the commercial market, they thenmake use of operational satellites such as those ofEUTELSAT.OLYMPUS utilisation will continue through 1993 and 1994,when the spacecraft will run out of fuel as it approaches theend of its design life.

If nothing else, a working SSTOis at least as complex as a large airliner and has a smaller experiencebase. It therefore seems that SSTO development should cost at least asmuch as a typical airliner development. That puts it in the $3G to $5Grange.>You can also assume that a working SSTO would have other applications>that would help pay for its development costs.True it and the contest would result in a much larger market.

 19Although the $1 billion scheme is a fantasy (it's an old canard in the spacebusiness called "trolling for billionaires"), there is a good chance that amuch smaller program ($65 million) will pass the 103rd Congress. This is theBack to the Moon bill, put together by the people who passed the LaunchServices Purchase Act. The bill would incent private companies to developlunar orbiters, with vendors selected on the basis of competitive bidding.There is an aggregate cap on the bids of $65 million. Having a single rich individual paying billions for lunar missions is probablyworse than having the government bankroll a $65 million program, as the DeltaClipper program has shown (DC-X was funded by SDIO at $59 million). We have aclear chance of making a lunar mission happen in this decade - as opposed tosimply wishing for our dreams to come true. Please support the Back to theMoon bill.

 16It should be noted that the US benefitted not only from German science andtechnology after WW2 but also from British science and technology. From thediscovery and manufacture of penicillin to jet engines, swing wing aircraft,the hovercraft etc etc. all were shipped lock-stick-and-barel across theAtlantic. We still are suffering from this sort of thing because of some of themore parochial aspects of US procurement policy.

"mothership" exceptfor Voyager style flyby missions. A few years ago, I did some calculations on a"Grand Tour" space probe launched by a Saturn V in 1975-76. At the time,I felt thatthe idea of a big "mother ship" had some merit - the Voyagers had to be rathersmall, lightweight craft due to the limitations imposed by using weak TitanIII/Centaur launchers. The concept I examined (and Michael's?) had a lot incommon with the British Interplanetary Society's Daedalus project for sending aprobe to Barnard's Star - i.e. a large "bus" spacecraft carrying severalsmaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination.The Saturn V supposedly would have been able to launch a 10-ton payload towardsJupiter and beyond. The "bus" could have included far more powerfulcameras/telescopes/scientific equipment and a heavier/more powerful powersource than the Voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore.Extremely important as the Voyagers had to perform most of their measurementswithin a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter, and usually at arelatively great distance.---The smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the "real" Voyagers,and an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards Pluto inthe early 21st century, and would have been released at various points duringthe mission. The advantages are obvious: the bus would have carried out thesame basic Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune mission than Voyager 2 did, but inaddition two "sub-probes" could have been relased at Saturn, examiningthat planet's south polar regions before moving on to Pluto. This would haveenabled NASA to map both hemispheres of Pluto/Charon by 1986...and severalother probes could have examined parts of the Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptunesystems that weren't examined in great detail by the Voyagers due totrajectory-related factors. A small "swarm" of camera-equipped miniature spaceprobes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a small Voyager-type mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy, well-equipped spacecraft. And would we have learned a lot more about the outerplanets! The reason why the Grand Tour was cancelled was lack of money, ofcourse.

Spaceflight is NOT in this position.The correct analogy is not with aviation of the '30's, but the longtransocean voyages of the Age of Discovery.  It didn't require gov't tofund these as long as something was known about the potential for profitat the destination.  In practice, some were gov't funded, some were private.But there was no way that any wise investor would spend a large amountof money on a very risky investment with no idea of the possible payoff.  I am sure that a thriving spaceflight industry will eventually develop,and large numbers of people will live and work off-Earth.  But if you askme for specific justifications other than the increased resource base, Ican't give them.  We just don't know enough.  The launch rate demanded byexisting space industries is just too low to bring costs down much, andwe are very much in the dark about what the revolutionary new space industrieswill be, when they will practical, how much will have to be invested tostart them, etc.--  Keith Mancus    <mancus@butch.jsc.nasa.gov>                           | N5WVR           <mancus@sweetpea.jsc.nasa.gov>                        | "Black powder and alcohol, when your states and cities fall,          |  when your back's against the wall...." -Leslie Fish                  |

Nor is it a trivial piece of hardware, since it has to includeattitude control (HST's own is not strong enough to compensate for thingslike thruster imbalance), guidance (there is no provision to feed gyrodata from HST's own gyros to an external device), and separation (youdon't want it left attached afterward, if only to avoid possiblecontamination after the telescope lid is opened again).  You also getto worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost isdone and HST is inaccessible to the shuttle (the lid stays closed forthe duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination fromthrusters and the like).The original plan was to use the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle to do thereboost.  The OMV was planned to be a sort of small space tug, wellsuited to precisely this sort of job.  Unfortunately, it was costinga lot to develop and the list of definitely-known applications wasrelatively short, so it got cancelled.-- SVR4 resembles a high-speed collision   | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoologybetween SVR3 and SunOS.    - Dick Dunn  |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry

Recognizing that most of the military requirementsfor launch vehicles are pulled out of a hat somewhere (say, has the shuttle ever really used that 1200mi crossrange capability?

Then to take all of those designs, and figure out EXACTLY whatthe technologies are, and demonstrate those technologies, in order to eliminate designs that can't be built today.  And lets say that thisportion again funded by the GOV cost about $20 million.And from here all of these companies went their separate ways, with theintention of taking all of the market data and the design data to wallstreet, and saying "I want to build this vehicle, and here are the numbersthat show %20 ROI, fund me...)Now many of you think that this is a joke, but I have it on good authority thatjust this project is shaping up in the background.

However, the rumors>I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter>seems more likely.Yo Ken, let's keep on-top of things! Both the "External Tank" and"Wingless Orbiter" options have been deleted from the SSF redesignoptions list. Today's (4/23) edition of the New York Times reportsthat O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals havebeen dropped, such as using the "giant external fuel tanks usedin launching space shuttles," and building a "station aroundan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed."Currently, there are three options being considered, as presentedto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported intoday's Times).Option "A" - Low Cost Modular ApproachThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,there are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supportingthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC andReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respectiveteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of thisoption are:  -  Uses "Bus-1", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that's     qualified for STS and ELV's. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this     for the Air Force.  -  A "Power Station Capability" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle     flies in an "arrow mode" to optimize the microgravity environment.     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power     source for 30 day missions.  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International     Partners' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and     add another 20 kW of power  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return     Vehicle).Option "B" - Space Station Freedom DerivedThe Option "B" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.This option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which wehave all come to know and love :)This option assumes a lightweight external tank is available foruse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option "A"). Also, the number of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,for both options "A" and "B".The build-up occurs in six phases:  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when     it visits.  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).  -  A "Two Fault Tolerance Capability" is achieved after 14 flights,     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the     assembly in 24 flights.Most of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, with the exception of the data management system, which has majorchanges.Option C - Single Core Launch Station.This is the JSC lead option. Basically, you take a 23 ft diametercylinder that's 92 ft long, slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines onthe backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a regular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocketmotors, and launch the can. Some key features are:  - Complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout  - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels  - body mounted radiators (which adds protection against    micrometeroid & orbital debris)  - 2 centerline docking ports (one on each end)  - 7 berthing ports  - a single pressurized volume, approximately 26,000 cubic feet    (twice the volume of skylab).  - 7 floors, center passageway between floors  - 10 kW of housekeeping power  - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels, 4 thermal    loops, dual environmental control & life support system)  - increased crew time for utilization  - 1 micro-g thru out the core module

Doesthat mean no resupply or ?? Need to find atleast $1billion for prize money.Contest open to different classes of participants.New Mexico State has semi-challenged University of Alaska (any branch) to put ateam together and to do it..Any other University/College/Institute of Higher Learning wish to make acounter challenge or challenge another school? Say it here.I like the idea of having atleast a russian team.Some prefer using new technology, others old or ..The basic idea of the New Moon Race is like the Solar Car Race acrossedAustralia.. Atleast in that basic vein of endevour..Any other suggestions?==Michael Adams, nsmca@acad3.alaska.edu -- I'm not high, just jacked

The wind behaves like a fluid pipe.It becomes incompressible.  So wind has to bend away from thewing edges.   AS the wing thickens,  the more the pipes bend.If they have no place to go,  they begin to stall,  and forcecompression, stealing power from the vehicle (High Drag).If you squeeze the fuselage,  so that these pipes  have aplace to bendinto,  then drag is reduced.   Essentially,  teh cross sectional area of the aircraft shoulfremain constant for all areas of the fuselage.  That is where the wings aresubtract, teh cross sectional area of the wings from the fuselage.pat
 17   I've been following discussions about the Delta Clipper program, and Ihave one small question.  As I understand it, the DC-X derived orbitalvehicle (DC-Y & 1) is to reenter the atmosphere sort of sideways, notcompletely nose-first.  So why is the DC-Y look symmetric in every drawingI've seen?  I would think that an asymmetric design, sort of like wingless Orbiter, may work better, since less shielding is required on thetop side.

This was partially so that everything couldbe reeled back in to put it back in the payload bay, and partially forsafety considerations.

 44    A bright light phenomenon was observed in the Eastern Finland    on April 21. At 00.25 UT two people saw a bright, luminous    pillar-shaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near    Mikkeli. The head of the pillar was circular. The lower part    was a little winding. It was like a monster they told. They    were little frightened. Soon the yellowish pillar became    enlarged. A bright spot like the Sun was appeared in the middle    of the phenomenon. At last the light landed behind the nearby    forest. Now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were    visible till morning sunrise.    The same phenomenon was observed also by Jaakko Kokkonen in    Lappeenranta. At 00.26 UT he saw a luminous yellowish trail in    the low northeastern horizont. The altitude of the trail was    only about 3-4 degrees. Soon the trail began to grow taller.    A loop was appeared in the head of the trail. It was like a    spoon. This lasted only 10 seconds. Now the altitude was about    five degress above horizont. He noted a bright spot at the    upper stage of loop. The spot was at magnitude -2. The loop    became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of    the loop. A cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright    spot. After a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails    were only visible in the low horizont. Luminous trails were still    visible at 01.45 UT in the morning sky.    The phenomenon was caused by a Russian rocket. I don't know if    there were satellite launches in Plesetsk Cosmodrome near    Arkhangelsk, but this may be a rocket experiment too. Since 1969    we have observed over 80 rocket phenomena in Finland. Most of    these are rocket experiments (military missile tests?), barium    experiments and other chemical releases. During these years we    have observed 17 satellite launches.

 33      Thanks to the people who have answered here and in email to my question about which countries engage in space surveillance. Unfortunately, I apparently didn't make the meaning of the message clear, since most replies have addressed satellite reconnaissance, rather than space surveillance      What I meant was _not_ which countries use satellites to look at the Earth (satellite reconnaissance) , but _was_ which countries have programs to detect and track (i.e., determine the orbital elements of) satellites as they pass overhead (space surveillance).     The US uses missile-defense radars, supplemented by a fascinating quasi-radar operated by the Navy, to do this for satellites in LEO, and electrooptical systems for objects at altitudes above 5,000 km or so. The FEE, I understand, does much the same thing.     Amateur satellite observers use eyeballs, binoculars, stopwatches and PCs for objects out to around 1500 km, enabling them to keep track of satellites for which, ah, official element sets aren't available. See the fascinating books by Desmond King-Hele for details, as well as the files in the molczan directory on kilroy.jpl.nasa.gov.  The material posted in my previous message suggests that Japan engages in optical and radar space surveillance to a modest degree, and it may be that other countries do also.     Which was the question I meant to ask: who are they, how do they do it, and why do they do it?Allen Thomson                     SAIC                        McLean, VA-------------------------------------------------------------------------Oh, yes: I don't speak for SAIC.

 20Hello netters,   I'm new to this board and I thought this might be the best placefor my post.  I have a question regarding satellite technology seenin the movie Patriot Games.  In the movies, the CIA utilizes itsorbitting sats to pinpoint a specific terrorist camp in N Africa.The photos taken by the sats are stunning!  I know that sats arecapable of photographing the license plates of vehicles.  Myquestion is this:  The camp in question was taken out by theBritish SAS.  And while the SAS was in action, the CIA team waswatching in the warroom back in Langley, VA.  The action of the SASwas clear and appeared to be relayed via a sat.  The action was atnight and the photography appeared to be an x-ray type.  That is,one could see the action within the tents/structures of the camp.Does such techology exist and what is it's nature?  i.e., UV, IR,x-ray, etc.PS  Who wrote the book Patriot Games?Mad Vlad

 25Suppose the Soviets had managed to get their moon rocket workingand had made it first.  They could have beaten us if either:* Their rocket hadn't blown up on the pad thus setting them back,and/or* A Saturn V went boom.If they had beaten us, I speculate that the US would have gonehead and done some landings, but we also would have been moredetermined to set up a base (both in Earth Orbit and on theMoon).  Whether or not we would be on Mars by now would dependupon whether the Soviets tried to go.  Setting up a lunar basewould have stretched the budgets of both nations and I thinkthat the military value of a lunar base would outweigh the valueof going to Mars (at least in the short run).  Thus we wouldhave concentrated on the moon./~~~(-: James T.

We have been using our processes since way before Challenger.  Challenger   in and of it self did not uncover flaws.2. What Mr. Spencer says is by and large true.  We have a process that is   not dependent on "sophisticated tools"  (CASE tools?).  However, tools   cannot fix a bad process.  Also, tool support for HAL/S (the Shuttle   Language) is somewhat limited.3. The Onboard Flight Software project was rated "Level 5" by a NASA team.   This group generates 20-40 KSLOCs of verified code per year for NASA.4.

It took 7 years to build Keck I and now they are buildingKeck II.  According to the December 1992 Sky & Telescope, "Thissecond 10-meter eye will convert the facility into a binocular telescopewith double the light-gathering power and the ability to resolvethe headlights of a car some 25,000 kilometers away."   Japan's 8.3-meterSubaru telescope will soon join Keck on Mauna Kea.  All these telescopeswill work in the infrared, yes, but they are _visible light_ telescopes!And haven't you heard anything about adaptive optics?  A lot of researchwas done with "Star Wars" funding, and some is now being shared withastronomers.  This shows great promise.  Soon, probably within a fewyears, even the largest telescopes will be able to resolve to their theoretical limit _despite_ the distortions of the atmosphere.To say that "visible light astronomy is already a dying field" is pure hokum.  To use the "logic" that things are already bad, so it doesn'tmatter if it gets worse is absurd.  Maybe common sense and logicare the dying fields.George Krumins-- Pufferfish Observatory         |^^^^^\\^^^^|     The Universe had its origingfk39017@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu       ^^^/\\ \\^^^      in two hockeysticks colliding                                   / /\\ \\        "Home of the Hockeystick  /_/  \\_\\  Memorial Telescope"

Additionally, there mightbe a concern about landing loads to the shuttle in the event of a ladenlanding.

But, the Salyut KB (Design Bureau) was planning a new LH/LOX second stage for the Proton which would boostpayload to LEO from about 21000 to 31500 kg. (Geostationary goes from2600 kg. (Gals launcher version) to 6000 kg.. This scheme was competingwith the Energia-M last year and I haven't heard which won, except nowI recently read that the Central Specialized KB was working on the successor to the Soyuz booster which must be the Energia-M. So the earlyresults are Energia-M won, but this is a guess, nothing is very clear in Russia. I'm sure if Salyut KB gets funds from someone they will continue their development. The Centaur for the Altas is about 3 meters dia. and the Proton is 4 so that's a good fit for their existing upper stage, the Block-Dwhich sets inside a shround just under 4 meters dia. I don't know aboutlaunch loads, etc.. but since the Centaur survives Titan launches whichare probably worse than the Proton (those Titan SRB's probably shake thingsup pretty good) it seems feasible. EXCEPT, the Centaur is a very fragilething and may require integration on the pad which is not available now.Protons are assembled and transported horizontially. Does anyone know how much stress in the way of a payload a Centaur could support whilebolted to a Proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road trackand erected on the pad?  They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads (unless the new Proton second stage is actually built), and of courseany Centaur support systems and facilities, no doubt imported from theUS at great cost. These systems may viloate US law so there are politicalproblems to solve in addition to the instabilities in the CIS you mention.

My poor old physics intuition will be very surprised if these tiny masses, sitting very close to Jupiter, play any role whatsoever in the problem.   Or, to put it more technically, the extra "volume" they add to the phase space of possible capture trajectories is negligible.  Jupiter is 2E27 kg, while the Galilean satellites are around 1E23.  Also, as I said, the few references that I've looked at do not mention outgassing or breakup as important processes.  The important thing is a Jupiter-Sun-comet "reverse slingshot" that leads to a weakly Jupiter-bound orbit for the comet (at least a temporary one).

This is a global hypertext (well, hypermedia) network running on the internet.  One of the nice thingsabout it is that is understands and incorporates virtually all of theother systems being used, like WAIS, Gopher, FTP, Archie, etc.  Itis usually quite easy to add existing resources to the web.If you'd like to explore, I'd suggest getting the XMosaic program,written at the NCSA.  It's an X-windows web browser, and is prettyslick.  It can understand and cope with more than text: gif, jpeg, mpeg,audio, etc.  There are other browsers, including a text-mode browserfor people stuck on a text terminal, but I'm most familliar with mosaic.Under the page "The World-Wide Web Virtual Library: Subject Catalogue"(this is available under the Documents menu in mosaic, or by anybrowser via the URL http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/Overview.html )there is a subject "Space Science."  Currently this points to apage under construction, with only the NASA JPL FTP archive.  I'vevolunteered to take over this page, and in fact I have a replacementwith all sorts of information pointers (mostly gleaned from thesci.space FAQ).

Sorry, you have a _wish_ for an uncluttered night sky, but itisn't a right. When you get down to it, you actually have no rightsthat the majority haven't agreed to give you (and them in the process).It's a common misconception that being born somehow endows you withrights to this that and the other.

Big difference.   That's ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution   to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well   known - in particular comet aphelia (which are not well known)   are not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution...Merging neutron stars is at least a mechanism with about the rightenergy, except it doesn't explain why there is no apparent correlationwith galaxies or galaxy structure, there is no mechanism for gettingall the energy out in gamma rays (with any significant amount ofbaryons around there will be a lot of pair production, which makes aplasma, which thermalizes the energy), it has trouble generatingenough energy to explain the most powerful bursts (10^52-53 ergs), ithappens too fast compared to the burst duration, and it is hard tomake tight-binaries of neutron stars.Another cosmological mechinism is the catalytic conversion of aneutron star to a strange star or the merger of two strange stars, butthat uses pretty far-out physics.My point is that we don't have a good mechanism at any distance, soGRB's are likely to be happening by an unknown mechanism, so we can'trule out the Oort cloud.  What would be the spectrum of an event whichconverts a comet to strange matter?  The spectra for primordial blackholes eating comets and antimatter comets colliding with matter cometsaren't quite right, but perhaps there is an unusual mechanism whichmodifies the spectrum.  The energy matches very well for both of thesemechanisms.  According to Trevor Weeks, if the "Tunguska Meteorite"was a mini-black hole collision with the earth, then there are likelyto be enough mini-black holes around that the rate for BH-cometcollisions matches the GRB rate well.The fact that we don't know the distribution of comets in the Oortcloud isn't a reason to rule them out; it makes it harder to rule themout.  The point of the cited paper was that if we assume they got theright distribution for the Oort cloud, it is hard but not impossibleto match that up with the distribution of GRB's.  If they got thewrong distribution for the Oort cloud, they can't constrain any Oort-cloud GRB's at all.Executive summary: we don't know enough to rule out out the Oortcloud.

It takesa long time, and you end up with a relatively inconvenient lunar orbit.If you want something useful like a low circular polar orbit, you do haveto plan to expend a certain amount of fuel, although it is reduced fromwhat you'd need for the brute-force approach.-- All work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology                    - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas    scintillation proportional counters.    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere,    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's    satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface.    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to    peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of    Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true    nature of Saturn's rings.

Has returned    the first resolved images of an asteroid, Gaspra, while in transit to    Jupiter. Efforts to unfurl the stuck High-Gain Antenna (HGA) have    essentially been abandoned. JPL has developed a backup plan using data    compression (JPEG-like for images, lossless compression for data from    the other instruments) which should allow the mission to achieve    approximately 70% of its original objectives.

Has made    multiple lunar flybys. Released Hagoromo, a smaller satellite,    into lunar orbit. This mission made Japan the third nation to    orbit a satellite around the Moon.    MAGELLAN - Venus radar mapping mission. Has mapped almost the entire    surface at high resolution. Currently (4/93) collecting a global gravity    map.    MARS OBSERVER - Mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera.    Launched 9/25/92 on a Titan III/TOS booster. MO is currently (4/93) in    transit to Mars, arriving on 8/24/93. Operations will start 11/93 for    one martian year (687 days).    TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite, launched    8/10/92 on an Ariane 4 booster. The primary objective of the    TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global    observations of the sea level for several years, substantially    increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also    will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.    ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over    its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from    that planet by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun's south pole    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft    that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is!    While in Jupiter's neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and    radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see    *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992). For gory technical    detail, see the many articles in the same issue.

You'd need to launch HLVs to send up large amounts of stuff *if* you assumeno new launcher development.  If you assume new launcher development, withlower costs as a specific objective, then you probably don't want tobuild something HLV-sized anyway.Nobody who is interested in launching things cheaply will buy Titans.  Itdoesn't take many Titan pricetags to pay for a laser launcher or a largegas gun or a development program for a Big Dumb Booster, all of whichwould have far better cost-effectiveness.

Oh well.I attended a colloquium at Goddard last fall where the head of the operations section of NASA was talking about what future missionswere going to be funded.  I don't remember his name or title off handand I have discarded the colloquia announcement. In any case, he was asked about that very matter: "Why can't we spend a few million moreto keep instruments that we already have in place going?"His responce was that there are only so many $ available to him andthe lead time on an instrument like a COBE, Magellan, Hubble, etcis 5-10 years minumum.  If he spent all that could be spent on usingcurrent instruments in the current budget enviroment he would havevery little to nothing for future projects.  If he did that, surein the short run the science would be wonderful and he would be popular,however starting a few years after he had retired he would becomeone of the greatest villans ever seen in the space community for notfunding the early stages of the next generation of instruments.  Justas he had benefited from his predicessor's funding choices, he owed itto whoever his sucessor would eventually be to keep developing newmissions, even at the expense of cutting off some instruments beforethe last drop of possible science has been wrung out of them.-- Covert C Beachdragon@access.digex.com

Henry, if I read you correctly, you may be asking "If I put a blackbodyin interstellar space ('disregarding the Sun and nearby large warm objects'),what termperature will it reach in thermal equilibrium with the ambientradiation field?"   If that's the case, let me point out that interstellar dust and molecules provide many instances of things that are, well, not-too-farfrom being blackbodies.  Many different observations, including IRASand COBE, have determined that interstellar dust grain temperaturescan range from 40K to 150K.

 52"Space Station Redesign Leader Says Cost Goal May BeImpossible"Today (4/6) the Washington Post ran an article with theheadline shown above. The article starts with "A leaderof the NASA team in charge of redesigning the plannedspace station said yesterday the job is tough and maybe impossible." O'Connor is quoted saying whether it ispossible to cut costs that much and still provide formeaningful research "is a real question for me."O'Connor said "everything is fair game," including"dropping or curtailing existing contracts with theaerospace industry, chopping management of the spacestation program at some NASA facilities around thecountry, working closely with the Russian space stationMir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement themanned space shuttle fleet."O'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design optionsso far, and they are sorting the serious candidatesinto three categories based on cost.The Post says O'Connor described the design derivedfrom the current SSF as a high cost option (I believeKathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. Ilistened in on part of O'Connor's briefing to the presson Monday, and in one part of the briefing O'Connortalked about how the White House wants three options,sorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another partof the briefing, he discussed the three teams he hasformed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC,modular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single LaunchCore ["wingless Orbiter"] @ JSC. Later, in response toa reporters question, I thought I heard O'Connor saythe option based on a SSF redesign was a "moderate"cost option, in between low & high cost options. Notthe "high cost" option as Sawyer wrote).The article goes on to describe the other two optionsas "one features modules that could gradually be fittedtogether in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. Theother is a core facility that could be deposited inorbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That optionwould use existing hardware from the space shuttle -the fuselage, for example, in its basic structure."The last sentence in the article contradicts the title& the first paragraph. The sentence reads "He[O'Connor] said a streamlined version of the plannedspace station Freedom is still possible within theadministration's budget guidelines."

 71I have 19 (2 MB worth!) uuencode'd GIF images contain charts outliningone of the many alternative Space Station designs being considered inCrystal City.  Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and canbe reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail atmholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.Mark proposed this design, which he calls "Geode" ("rough on theoutside, but a gem on the inside") or the "ET Strongback withintegrated hab modules and centrifuge."  As you can see from filegeodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of muchof the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  Thewhite track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station RemonteManipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)pod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrustingcan occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the massproperties of the Station change during assembly.The inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily becauseit can approach closer to the Station's CG and at a structurally strongpart of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces arelimited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of thedocking system.The ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additionallaunch mass.  We've always had the ability to put an ET into orbit(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we've neverhad a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventualde-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent theresidual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit fromimpact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy aKevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminatingthe local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providingfurther micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,it supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as thenucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.The white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control MomentGyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be usedfor gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit systemwhich can be used at the end of the Station's life to perform acontrolled de-orbit (so we don't kill any more kangaroos, like wedid with Skylab).The centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could beused for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravityon humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage devicefor the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted onone of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.This design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,data and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF workdone to date.Mark proposed this design at Joe Shea's committee in Crystal City,and he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumorsI hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiterseems more likely.Please note that this text is my interpretation of Mark's design;you should see his notes in the GIF files.  Instead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these foranon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.

What I completly disagree with is seperating thatintegration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is calledleadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility forthe success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadershipand responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set upas Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFCand they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston tofinally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of theprocess then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.There is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is thatfor a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of theturn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It islack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack ofleadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only asymptom of a greater national problem.

Beyond that, I have no other info.The sightings were apparently spurious.  There is no planet inside ofthe orbit of Mercury.The idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury's observedperihelion precession and the value it should have had according toNewtonian physics.  Leverrier made an extensive set of observationsand calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe laterimproved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier's systemof equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptuneand since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbitof Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing wasafoot with Mercury.But alas, 'twere not so.  Mercury's perihelion precesses at the rateit does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantlycurved due to the sun's mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915and Albert Einstein's synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamicsof moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian geometry.  The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one ofit's most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precessionof Mercury's perihelion almost exactly.  (Exactly if you use Newcomb'snumbers rather than Leverrier's.)Of course not everybody believes Einstein, and that's fine.  But subsequentefforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury using radarhave been fruitless.-Bill Gawne "Forgive him, he is a barbarian, who thinks the customs of his tribe  are the laws of the universe."                       - G.

When they use the _same_ deconvolution software on the images from the fixed Hubble, be ready for some incredible results!  There is every reason to believe that the results will _exceed_ the original specs by a fair margin.  Adaptive optics is a combination of hardware and software.  It works realtime, not after the fact, as is the case with Hubble.  You might beinterested to know this technology has made it to the amateur market, inthe form of the AO-2 Adaptive Optics System.  Starting on page 52 of the April, 1993 Sky & Telescope is a three page review of this new product.It lists for $1,290.  The article states: "The AO-2 Adaptive Optics System comes in a handy soft-plastic case that a three-year-old could carry around."  Even though this device is really only good for the brightestobjects, "it could cope with image movements of up to 0.8 millimeterin the telescope's focal plane."  Now just imagine how well this infant technology will do in a few years, especially in a dedicated system that has hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many man-hours invested in itsdevelopment.George Krumins-- Pufferfish Observatory         |^^^^^\\^^^^|     The Universe had its origingfk39017@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu       ^^^/\\ \\^^^      in two hockeysticks colliding                                   / /\\ \\        "Home of the Hockeystick  /_/  \\_\\  Memorial Telescope"

The energy isn'tcoming from nowhere.  What such systems do is convert some of the energyof your orbital velocity into electrical energy.  There are cases wherethis is a useful tradeoff.  Using power obtained in this way for propulsionis useful only in special situations, however.What you *can* do is get your power by some other means, e.g. solar arrays,and run the interaction with the magnetic field in reverse, pumping energy*into* the orbit rather than taking energy out of it.If you want more information, trying looking up "electrodynamic propulsion","tether applications", and "magsails".>Can the idea of a "dragless" satellite be used in part to create the>electrical field?No.  A "dragless" satellite does not magically have no drag; it burns fuelconstantly to fight drag, maintaining the exact orbit it would have *if*there was no drag.

 58Joint Press release ESA/UN No 18-93Paris, 19 April 1993UN/ESA joint training course on satellite applicationsto be held in Italy, 19-30 AprilThe United Nations and the European Space Agency (ESA)are jointly organising a training course on the applications ofsatellite data gathered by the European Remote SensingSatellite (ERS-1), to be held in Frascati, Italy, from 19 to 30April. The training course will discuss the applications ofsatellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energyand the environment.The training course, organised for the benefit of francophoneAfrican experts, will be hosted by ESRIN, the European SpaceAgency's establishment in Frascati, which is responsible forcoordination with the users of data from ESA's remote sensingsatellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing,selected from 19 francophone countries from northern, westernand central Africa, and three regional African centres, willattend the two-week session. The course will focus on remotesensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1data.The ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991with the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radarinstrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensingmissions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year2000. The aim of the training course is to increase thepotential of experts using the practical applications of radarremote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energyand the environment, with particular emphasis on applicationsto geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near-coastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.The education and practical training programme wasdeveloped jointly by the United Nations and ESA. Thefacilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers andinformation documents for the training course, will beprovided by the Agency. Lecturers at the training course willinclude high-level experts from other European and Africanorganisations active in remote sensing applications. Funds forthe training course are being provided by the United NationsTrust Fund for New and Renewable Sources of Energy; theprimary contributor to that Fund is the Government of Italy.A similar training course is being planned for Latin Americanexperts.

On April 22 and 23, delta Differenced One-way Range (DOR) passes wereperformed over DSS-14/63 (Goldstone/Madrid 70 meter antennas) and DSS-14/43(Goldstone/Canberra 70 meter antennas), respectively.  Initial results indicate the delta DOR pass on April 22 was unsuccessful due to groundstation hardware problems but the one on April 23 was successfully performed.2.  On April 23, a cruise science Memory Readout (MRO) was performed for theMagnetometer (MAG) instrument.  Analysis indicates the data was receivedproperly.3.  On April 23, the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via thespacecraft stored sequence.  These relays were commanded closed by the CDS(Command Data Subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed topreclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays/wiring being asource of internal electrostatic charge (IESD).4.  On April 26, cruise science Memory Readouts (MRO) were performed for theExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was receivedproperly.5.  During the period from April 26 to April 27, a navigation cycle wasperformed.  This navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition oftwo-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of thespacecraft over DSS-63, DSS-14, and DSS-43.6.  On April 26, real-time commands were sent to test slew the Radio RelayAntenna (RRA) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on April 28.The RRA was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately20.3 degrees.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18degrees which was well within the predicted range.  The RRA was commanded backto approximately 15.2 degrees from stow.  Preliminary analysis indicated theantenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range.  TheRRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and hadincreased to 1.6 degrees C at its completion.     After verifying proper RRA slewing, the RRA slew test mini-sequence wasuplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28.  Upon successful uplink,a Delayed Action Command (DAC) was sent which will reposition the stator onMay 4 to its initial pre-test position.  Also, a DAC was sent to turn theTwo-Way Noncoherent (TWNC) on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew testmini-sequence.7.  On April 27, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.8.  On April 28, the RRA slew test executed nominally.  The spacecraft understored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degreesfrom stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees,back to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  All ofthe slews were well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature wasat 2.3 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4degrees C at its completion.  After completion of the RRA slews, real-timecommands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration.9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 17 DN(3.9 volts).  The DC measurement reads 134 DN (15.7 volts).  Thesemeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC specialanomaly team.10. The Spacecraft status as of April 29, 1993, is as follows:       a)  System Power Margin -  75 watts       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 23 degrees           off-sun (lagging) and 4 degrees off-earth (leading)       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within           acceptable range       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within           acceptable range       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours           Time To Initiation - 203 hoursGDS (Ground Data Systems):1.  The first Galileo-GDS test of the MGDS V18.0 Command System (CMD) tookplace April 27, 1993 with DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna).  The test wentwell and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN(Deep Space Network) Group 5 Command Processor Assembly (CPA).  The test wassuccessful and the next test for V18.0 CMD is scheduled for May 1, 1993 withDSS-15 (Goldstone 34 meter antenna).2.

A review of currentProject and Institutional (DSN and MOSO) system status was conducted.  On-goingcruise development plus the GSDO Phase 1 and 2 delivery schedules, past monthsaccomplishments  and potential problem areas were discussed.  No significantschedule changes or significant problems were reported.TRAJECTORY     As of noon Thursday, April 29, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectorystatus was as follows:Distance from Earth         187,745,300 km (1.26 AU)Distance from Sun           296,335,800 km (1.98 AU)Heliocentric Speed          89,100 km per hourDistance from Jupiter       522,015,800 kmRound Trip Light Time       20 minutes, 58 secondsSPECIAL TOPIC1.

 82   Two developments have brought these type of activities back tothe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed fromthe Mir Space Station.  While this "Banner" reflector was blank,NPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Bannerreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-based video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TVcommercial, as filmed from the Mir.   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, thesame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestogabooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "EnvironmentalBillboard".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of theUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of theLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "EnvironmentalBillboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,deployed by the inflatable 'frame'.   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible formaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone readingsensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth'sdelicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head ofSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimumexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth'satmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns,it will release ozone-building components that will literallyreplenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitorthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burnsup and "adds to the ozone supply."   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least severalmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMIestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people whowatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising 'unit' cost$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is beingpromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996Summer Olympics in Atlanta.  But back to Brian's questions:>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild>idea" stage or does it have real funding?      See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (myestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus$10-15 M for a launch), then it's probably real.  They are claiming totailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times foroptimum advertising impact so they probably can't piggy back uponsomeone else's planned launch and will have to buy a dedicatedlaunch.  That's a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this aswell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the useof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don't think thelegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,and no, I don't really like the idea of this additional lightpollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legalchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positiveaspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make theadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would changepositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate thespace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like anidiot?)   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it's in a lowenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it wouldonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and beforedawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible justafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that's the timeof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might stillbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  Therewere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestogaadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was foronly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven't heard of any serious fundingfor this, but I'm sure they are shopping the venture around lookingfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But Iam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.     And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please bemy guest.

In fact, be-fore BATSE, having this widely separated "Interplanetary Network" was theonly sure way to locate a random burst.  With only one detector, one cannotlocate a burst (except to say "It's somewhere in the field of view.").  Withtwo detectors, one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detectorto narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky.  With three detectors,one gets intersecting annuli, giving two possible locations.  If one of theselocations is impossible (because, say, the Earth blocked that part of the sky), voila, you have an error box.BATSE, by having 8 detectors of its own, can do its own location determination,but only to within about 3 degrees (would someone at GSFC, like David, liketo comment on the current state of location determination?).  Having inde-pendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty.You did touch on something that you didn't mean to, though.  Some believe(in a reference that I have somewhere) that absorption-like features seenin a fraction of GRBs can actually be caused by the detector.  It would bea mean, nasty God, though, that would have a NaI crystal act like a 10^12 Gaussneutron star...but this is getting too far afield.Peterpeterf@oddjob.uchicago.edu
 16Question: what is the power spectrum of the bursts. Are their sharp lines?If so, can they be interpreted as blue-shifted atomic or molecular lines?Can electron-positron annihilation gammas be seen in the bursts? Are theyred shifted or blue shifted?Since the bursts are isotropic and maybe in the galactic halo they maybe saying something about dark matter in the halo.If the bursts are something like the cosmic black body radiation fromway back then where are the red shifts - I mean cosmological red shifts?Consider a wild idea - what if the bursts are advanced photons from thefuture rather than retarded ones from the past. Would advanced photonsfrom far future when universe was considerably more expanded getblue shifted as they propagate to younger states of the universe?

Forproviding me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.Space Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage RocketTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How tolower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --and I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry forour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of atorch from one technical generation to another.  It is a newthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old thingsfrom past masters.     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so calledexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made nosense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president ofthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space." Well Dr. Rachtin -- you've made us mad!  What are theseprinciples that SSRT defies?     Well I'll tell you.  It violates the principle that you needa giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the"fact" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And itviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant forless than many billions of dollars.     It took some of the last generation's experts to teach ussome new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun's first rocket was not aSaturn V.  General Schriever's ICBM's didn't take ten years todemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn't cost $1 billion.     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950's to remindus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was asenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,cheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of asingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960's. Because he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build alittle, Test a little.     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  Wedidn't solicit a bunch of requirements -- they'd just changeevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- TheALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would betterknown as "Shape Shifter" than "Space Lifter."  We didn't spend alot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When's thelast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn'ttake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted ofone very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by thethreat that he'd get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair ifit ran over cost or schedule.     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn't keep in mind itsonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and stepsthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  Buteach step should follow the same principles -- a small managementteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modestbudget.     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:(See charts)     I'm embarrassed when my generation is compared with the lastgeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950'sand 1960's.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope thatcan't see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least wecould do is soft-land on Earth!     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build alittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordableand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers amongyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermalprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to landhorizontally, etc, etc.     I say to you -- we'll see you at White Sands in June.  Youbring your view-graphs, and I'll bring my rocketship.  If we dowhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.  [ notincluded in the speech:  If we fail -- you still have yourprogram offices, staff summary sheets, requirement analyses, anddecade long programs.]     I bet on my generation and Max Hunter's idea -- Any Takers?

Well, first you work out how much cold gas you need, then make the   tanks big enough.Our sounding rocket payload, with telemetry, guidance, etc. etc. and atelescope cluster, weighs around 1100 pounds.  It uses freon jets forsteering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ieduring our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty muchcontinuously firing on a ~10% duty cycle or so...).  The jets alsoneed to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization, andflip the payload around to look at the Sun.We have two freon tanks, each holding ~5 liters of freon (I'm speakingonly from memory of the last flight).  The ground crew at WSMR choose howmuch freon to use based on some black-magic algorithm.  They haveextra tank modules that just bolt into the payload stack.This should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas quantity.  If you really need to know, send me email and I'll try to get youin touch with our ground crew people.Cheers,Craig--DON'T DRINK SOAP! DILUTE DILUTE! OK!

(Healso noted that the software people were starting to feel managementpressure to cut corners, but hadn't had to give in to it much yet.)Among other things, the software people worked very hard to get thingsright for the major pre-flight simulations, and considered a failureduring those simulations to be nearly as bad as an in-flight failure.As a result, the number of major-simulation failures could be countedon one hand, and the number of in-flight failures was zero.As Fred mentioned elsewhere, this applies only to the flight software.Software that runs experiments is typically mostly put together by theexperimenters, and gets nowhere near the same level of Tender Loving Care.(None of the experimenters could afford it.)-- All work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology                    - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry
 103I have attached a copy of an announcement I picked up during my trip toMoscow last week.  I have several friends at the Moscow AviationInstitute who have asked me to post this announcement.  (I have donesome editing, but the contents is unchanged from the originalannouncement.) For those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute, it isthe leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the trainingof aircraft and spacecraft designers.  It specializes in airframedesign, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems.Virtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev,Su, Iluchine, Migoyan, etc.) were schooled at MAI.I had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained atMAI.  The aircraft include Mig23, Su 27, Yak 38, the cockpit of anF-111(!), among others.  It was a fascinating and eye openingexperience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a yearor so ago, closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity tosee some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive enginesfor future space craft use.If you have any questions about the Institute, or the program, I wouldbe glad to try and answer them.  The institute, and most of it's facultyhave e-mail addresses.  However, it takes about a day or so for thereceiver to get the message.

Similar prizes have influenced aerospace development before. The $25k Orteig prize helped Lindbergh sell his Spirit of Saint Louis venture to his financial backers.If memory serves, the $25k prize would not have been enough to totally reimburse some of the more expensive transatlantic projects (such as Fokker's, Nungesser and other multi-engine projects). However Lindbergh ultimately kept his total costs below that amount.But I strongly suspect that his Saint Louis backers had the foresight to realize that much more was at stake than $25,000.Could it work with the moon? Who are the far-sighted financial backers of today?Layne Cookcook@apt.mdc.com                                             McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co.

So some of my ideas are a bit odd, off the wall and such, but so was Wilbur andOrville Wright, and quite a few others.. Sorry if I do not have the big degreesand such, but I think (I might be wrong, to error is human) I have somethingthat is in many ways just as important, I have imagination, dreams. And withoutdreams all the knowledge is worthless.. Sorry my two cents worth. Or is it two rubles worth?The basic quote idea is from H. Beam Pipers book "Space Vikings". Its a goodbook on how civilization can fall, and how it can be raised to new heights.Unfortunately H. Beam Piper killed him self just weeks short of having hisfirst book published, and have his ideas see light.. Such a waste.

Why not hold on to them and have a shuttle : bring them down to use as spares?One performance reason comes to mind: if you jettison the SSME's, youdon't have to drag them with you when you perform your circularizationburn(s).  On-orbit, SSME's are just dead weight, since we don't have anSSME H2/O2 pressurization mechanism which works in zero-G.  This meansthat you can't use them for re-boost or anything else.  Dead weight hasa couple of advantages, but more disadvantages.Throw-away SSME's might let us use some of the old SSME's which are not-quite-man-ratable.

Given the enormous  power,  i was just wondering,  what if they are   quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by?   Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges?   Now, in the good old days before GRO data, it was thought thegamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy, it was expected thatGRO would confirm this by either showing they were a local population(within a few hundred light years) or that they were in the galactichalo. (Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed)(also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster wasprobably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...)As the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halopopulation should show anisotropy (a local disk population isruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy youhave to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanismof getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should startto see for example the Andromeda's bursters.The data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution(but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source withthe right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (henceisotropy) and the edge is "the edge of the Universe" ;-)If at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect)and a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron starcolliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then gettingthe spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.If we know anything about physics at that level,the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmicstrings, wrong spectrum for one thing.The situation is further complicated by recent claims thatthere are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NSthey'd actually probably fit relatively easily into theNS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]   my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering   hyperspace :-)   but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they   are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered   if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.If you can think of one, remember to invite me to Stockholm...*  Steinn Sigurdsson   Lick Observatory      **  steinly@lick.ucsc.edu"standard disclaimer"  **  The laws of gravity are very,very strict**  And you're just bending them for your own benefit - B.B. 1988*

ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD   On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co-inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D.Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell ScienceCenter in Thousand Oaks, CA.   Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in SpaceMaterials Processing with the Space Systems Division of RockwellInternational in Downey, California.  He is a recognized worldauthority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written orcoauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrialmaterials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. DavidCriswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.   Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legalexperts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to buildthe Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with apotential to power the globe.   For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly halffrom California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientificconcept of a solar power system based on the Moon.   The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunarsurface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmittedthrough orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormoussource of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's everincreasing demand using proven, basic technology.   OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of SpaceIndustrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of theNational Space Society, which is an international non-profitorganization that promotes development of the space frontier.The Ventura County chapter is based in Oxnard, CA.

Hathaway The problem is no-one seems to have the exact numbers.  When the missionwas planned originally at 3 spacewalks,  and 3 astronauts,  there wasenormous concern over the mass margins for the flight.  THeyhave now planned for 5 EVA's,  an 11 day mission and have 2 reserveEVA's and an emergency EVA.  Obviously that is coming from somewhere.My guess is the OMS burn  fuel,  or  re-boost  margin.   I just figured, if GOldin wants to really,  prove out faster, cheaperbetter,   have some of the whiz kids  slap together an expendablespace manuevering tug  out of a BUs1,  and use that for the re-boost.it has to be better then using the Discovery as a tow truck.pat

Our branch guy who's helpingout says that things have gone smoothly with the iso-valve preps and theburns will take place in mid-June.Anyway, I'm off to find out more.

Q. How do I become an astronaut?    A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it's probably    impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying    passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have    so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to    win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet    experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you    want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle "mission    specialist".    If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly    exceeds the supply.  NASA's problem is not finding qualified people,    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.It is not enough    to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands    dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-    seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in    another seems to be a frequent winner.    Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.(DO NOT get a    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term    effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other    significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,    you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor.    Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in    appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying    to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you    are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is    a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and    proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.    Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,    and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.    Keep your nose clean.    Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby;    experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.    Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,    43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were    a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).    If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job    at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant "you    do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first".    Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance    to demonstrate motivation.    Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn't make it the first time.    NASA    National Aeronautics and Space Administration    Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center    Houston, Texas    Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates    ==================================================================    Astronaut Candidate Program    ---------------------------    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for    Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates    to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be    considered.    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in    Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation    program.    Space Shuttle Program Description    ---------------------------------    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and    flight crew.    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space    Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include    government agencies and private industries.    The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,    and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are    assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA    astronauts.    Pilot Astronaut    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,    crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing    the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other    payload operations.    Mission Specialist Astronaut    Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,    have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations    in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and    experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to    have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed    knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and    objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission    specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling    using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific    experimental operations.

Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidate:    1. Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering,    biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be    followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,    professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable and may be    substituted for part or all of the experience requirement (master's    degree = 1 year, doctoral degree = 3 years). Quality of academic    preparation is important.    2. Ability to pass a NASA class II space physical, which is similar to a    civilian or military class II flight physical and includes the following    specific standards: Distant visual acuity:      20/150 or better uncorrected,      correctable to 20/20, each eye. Blood pressure:      140/90 measured in sitting position.    3. Height between 58.5 and 76 inches.    Pilot Astronaut Candidate:    1. Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering,    biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be    followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,    professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable. Quality of    academic preparation is important.    2. At least 1000 hours pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft. Flight    test experience highly desirable.    3. Ability to pass a NASA Class I space physical which is similar to a    military or civilian Class I flight physical and includes the following    specific standards: Distant visual acuity:      20/50 or better uncorrected      correctable to 20/20, each eye. Blood pressure:      140/90 measured in sitting position.    4. Height between 64 and 76 inches.    Citizenship Requirements    Applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program must be citizens of    the United States.    Note on Academic Requirements    Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic    education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions --    specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum    in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor's    degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,    biological science, physical science, or mathematics.      The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the    sciences, are not considered qualifying:      - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology,Medical Technology, etc.)      - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, PhysiologicalPsychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).      - Degrees in Nursing.      - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)      - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.    Application Procedures    ----------------------    Civilian    The application package may be obtained by writing to:NASA Johnson Space CenterAstronaut Selection OfficeATTN: AHXHouston, TX 77058    Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA    decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be    given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is    made. Applications received after that date will be retained and    considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate    continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from    consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the    preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be    requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as    supervisors and references may be contacted.    Active Duty Military    Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their    respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application    procedures will be disseminated by each service.    Selection    ---------    Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.    Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered    will be notified of the outcome of the process.    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following    their establishment.    General Program Requirements    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,    Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to    ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during    their candidate period.    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does    not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and    evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become    permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for    a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not    selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA    depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that    time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a    specified tour of duty.    NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified    minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.    Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.    Pay and Benefits    ----------------    Civilians    Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal    Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,    and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements    and experience.    Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and    participation in group health and life insurance plans.    Military    Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center    but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and    other similar military matters.NEXT: FAQ #15/15 - Orbital and Planetary Launch Services

The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE    archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest.

For the most up to date information on upcoming    missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.    Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news    frequently.    WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?    The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks    (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).    The "Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual," ASC G&C 2102,    says:"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude iscommanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch towerclearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate anegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Otheradvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abortmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view ofthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gainingdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) targetin second stage."    This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try    to interpret.    1)We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.    2)Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attackbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the"relative wind") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary linebetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightlynegative angle ("a negative q-alpha").This causes a little bit of"downward" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Zdirection) and this force "alleviates structural loading."We have to be careful about those wings -- they're about themost "delicate" part of the vehicle.    3)The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry moremass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, orto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would bethe case if we didn't roll ("performance gain").    4)The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicatedflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abortmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site ("decreased abort maneuvercomplexity").    5)The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radioantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radioantennae on the Orbiter ("improved S-band look angles").    6)The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is ahelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.    7)The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body ismore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocityin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to itsvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.    This all begs the question, "Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to    achieve that attitude?"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the "top"    [Orbiter side] and the "bottom" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the    Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle    guy.)    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.He added that the "roll    maneuver" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total    maneuver is really expressed as a "quaternion," a grad-level-math    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element    array.    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite    for these viewers.    If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.    It's worth asking if yours doesn't.    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions    are not being covered.

The commentaries included are my thoughts on these developments.     Sigh... as usual, I've gotten behind in getting this column written.  I can only plead the exigency of the current dynamics in the space biz.  This column is put together at lunch hour and after the house quiets down at night, so data can quickly build up if there's a lot of other stuff going on.  I've complied a lot of information and happenings since the last column, so I'm going to have to work to keep this one down to a readable length.  Have fun!

As published in "US Industrial Outlook 1993" (which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M.    In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had shown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7 satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to $450 M, future sales will be "adversely affected by the downward revision in Department of Defense launch plans."                              Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%).

In general, not a bad report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth $100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very successful in regaining international market share in the satellite business.    Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually publishes a listing of  "Space Business Indicators" in mid-year, and the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the numbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth.    Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top $3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year through the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive as currently projected.)    It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] 2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract.    The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although details of the launch services contract were reported to be negotiation, and not yet final.    The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  Under this contract the USAF can also request "launch on demand" services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to occur within 40 days of the request.     [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should provide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping MDC as a viable commerical launch company.     However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these contracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year.    Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III program in favor of the USAF NLS/"Spacelifter" program.  At this time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and Congress propose cancellation of all "ELV upgrade" programs (including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed "Spacelifter" program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to find in the shrinking US Defense budget.]  3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC "GO-AHEAD"   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of Commerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral images of the Earth.    [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new venture as a "Star Wars" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable customers for this service include exploration geologists, agricultural planners, and urban planners.     It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the 1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices.    There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote sensing ventures working their way through the system at different stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures appearing in the next year or so.]                  4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ "STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT"    Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General Dynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent analyst's report Morgan Stanley said "We are more than ever convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical 95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-generating unit."  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and $100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market.    [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has hurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, many market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected to be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur program is back on track, this division will continue to show substantial losses.    In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  In GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction (Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the $700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of change for any company.]  5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the next decade.    Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14 contracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts.    Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can compete are projected to come from communications satellites with the remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region.    Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with larger communications payloads carrying more transponders. Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications satellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to about 3000 kg in GEO.    Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing or near-term transponders.    One of the significant possible changes in the market was identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal.    [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.  Comparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical transponders on orbit.   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability service, but only from established point A to established point B. To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable between the points, and while there are improved network solutions, installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost millions or billions of dollars.     For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to handle the increase in traffic.    Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from last generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite launches over longer intervals.    And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it looks like the space transportation market will be rather over-supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, Japan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per year.  That's a lot of capability for a small market.    We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial launches.]6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT    The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation of range safety rules.     In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the valid abort call.    Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed.    Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used in the launch.   [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested by the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.     At the time of writing this column, some of the initial investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four different communications channels were in use during the test. After the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the best set being that clear lines of communications and clear definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and understanding of the mission rules were not established before the launch.     As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they do with commercial aircraft problems).     I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how specific lines of authority should be delineated.] 7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the "Aerokosmos" winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the "Severkosmos", launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called 'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow.    [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union.    This one's a little different in that they are offering variants of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being targeted or substantial financial backing.]8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses.    [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected returns were too low to justify the cost of development.     This might point out some key discriminators in judging the feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage sufficient to recover setup costs?  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the investment?     Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush authorized space technology transfer for several joint space ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in development funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor launch vehicle as well as from the US.    [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.  However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on system).     This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to find any other European development work with even a rumor of funding for hardware.    Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled the country in the 1970's and early 1980's.    What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq in the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package lagged that of the propulsion system.    It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B satellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has yet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this contract.] 10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2 launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as "the main alternative rocket supplier" for the small satellite launch service to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the Swedish satellite was not specified.    [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From PacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series rockets are built of "off the shelf" components based upon the Lunar MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a 225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.     PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and 2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the board of directors.     PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least $550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to design, build and launch their first set of vehicles.    The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real hardware.] 11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the satellite's communications channels.     [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 M) through 2006.     I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two separate sastellite ventures.    The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is "Asiasat-2", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing Hong Kong-based "Asiasat" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to proceed.    In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This is just another indicator to add to the list.] 12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES   South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by 1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's aerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by 2000.                                    [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its national aerospace industry, specifically including space activities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are coming into the commercial space market.    As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea.    South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US $8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely "made in Korea."  Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-monitoring micro-satellite.    This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with optical and microwave sensors.   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel military effort to establish the capabilities for building and launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a government panel had been established to oversee such an effort, funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the Korean peninsula.          In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has announced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).     This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition of commercial space market there over the next decade.] 13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH   As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite well, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its results in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....

 28Nntp-Posting-Host: acad3.alaska.eduThat is an idea.. The most efficient moon habitat.. also the idea of how to get the people off the moon once the prize was won..Also the idea of how to rescue someone who is "dying" on the moon.Maybe have a area where they can all "see" each other, and can help each otherif something happens.. I liek the idea of one prize for the first moon landing and return, by anon-governmental body..Also the idea of then having a moon habitat race.. I know we need to do somthing to get people involved..Eccentric millionaire/billionaire would be nice.. We see how old Ross feelsabout it.. After all it would be a great promotional thing and a way to show hedoes care about commericalization and the people.. Will try to broach thesubject to him.. Moonbase on the cheap is a good idea.. NASA and friends seem to take to muchtime and give us to expensive stuff that of late does not work (hubble andsuch).

That can be had, mostly through Tripoli (the high-power analog of the NAR), although the NAR is cautiously moving to extendthe upper boundaries of what it considers proper too.You need special FAA authorization, but provided you aren't doing it underone of the LAX runway approaches or something stupid like that, it's notespecially hard to arrange.As with model rocketry, this sort of hardware is reasonably safe if handledproperly.  Proper handling takes more care, and you need a lot more emptyair to fly in, but it's basically just model rocketry scaled up.  As withmodel rocketry, the high-power people use factory-built engines, whicheliminates the major safety hazard of do-it-yourself rocketry.-- All work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology                    - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry

The question is whether: anyone is going to be doing large-scale satellite servicing in the near: future, to the point of justifying development of such a thing.That's a mighty fine idea.  But since you asked "Why not," I'llrespond.Putting aside the application of such a space dock, there are otherfactors to consider than just pressurized volume.  Temperature controlis difficult in space, and your inflatable hangar will have to incorporate thermal insulation (maybe a double-walled inflatable).Micrometeoroid protection and radiation protection are also required.Don't think this will be a clear plastic bubble; it's more likelyto look like a big white ball made out of the same kind of multi-layerfabric that soft-torso space suits are made out of today.Because almost all manned space vessels (Skylab, Mir, Salyut) usedtheir pressurization for increased structural rigidity, even thoughthey had (have) metal skins, they still kind of qualify as inflatable.The inflation process would have to be carefully controlled.  Thespace environment reduces ductility in exposed materials (due totemperature extremes, monotomic Oxygen impingement, and radiationeffects on materials), so your "fabric" may not retain any flexibilityfor long.  (This may not matter.)  Even after inflation, pressurechanges in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric, which couldlead to holes and tears as ductility decreases.These are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposalfor an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees ofsuccess.-- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office      kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368     "Good ideas are common -- what's uncommon are people who'll      work hard enough to bring them about." -- Ashleigh Brilliant

 24Nntp-Posting-Host: starfighter.den.mmc.comRegarding the feasability of retrieving the HST for repair andrelaunching it:(Caution: speculation mode engaged)There is another consideration that hasn't been mentioned yet.I expect that retrieving HST would involve 'damaging' it considerably inorder to return it to its cradle in the cargo bay.  Most of the deployeditems (antennas and, especially, the solar arays) probably are notretractable into their fully stowed position, even by hand.  They wouldhave to be removed by the astronauts.  (The only advantage that thismight yield is that we could put new panels on that don't 'ring' dueto thermal cycle stresses...)I also expect that, as has been discussed, the landing loads on theHST optics structure is a big issue (but that the reentry loads aremuch less so.)  Can the moveable optical components even be re-caged(I assume that they were caged for launch)?-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Michael Corvin       zwork@starfighter.den.mmc.comGN&C R&DMartin Marietta Astronautics-----------------------------------------------------------------------------===============    My views, not Martin Marietta's   ========================-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thedocument would scientifically analyze the technical aspects of longterm human habitation in space.I believe that if any long-term space exploration program is to succeed we need to basically learn how to engineer our own microworld(i.e. the spacecraft).  Only through the careful analyses of engineering,chemical, biological, and medical factors will a good ecosystem be createdto facilitate human life on a long-duration flight.So, I would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objectivemethods to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologieswhich can be applied to long-duration spaceflight.  Such a detailedliterature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocatesand clearly important to existing space programs.In essence, we would be dividing the space life science issues intovarious technical problems which could be solved with various technologies.This database of acceptable solutions to various problems could form thebasis of detailed discussions involving people from the bionet, isunet,and any other source!I'm eager to hear your comments and see posts on this thread.

 19Hi all,I really thought that by now I would have seen somethingabout this, but I haven't, so here goes:  Last night onthe evening news, the anchorperson said something to theeffect that one of the SSRBs that was recovered after therecent space shuttle launch was found to have a wrench ofsome sort rattling around apparently inside the case.  Therewas no elaboration as to where specfically the item wasfound, of what type of wrench it was, but the anchorpersondid say something about a NASA official commenting thatthere would be an inquiry into how the thing got in the SSRB.Has anybody else on the net whose info sources may be better than mine heard anything about this?

Massive amounts of regolith wouldhave to be processed.This thread reminds me of Wingo's claims some time ago about the moonas a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasn'tcontent with being assured that titanium (at .5% in the Earth's crust,average) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though themarket price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound.This prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.On the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; "high-Ti" basalts (Apollo 11and 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice, but...terrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched intitanium.  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, andsometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are*enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over theworld (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  Ifeven 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2at concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Tibasalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the mooncould be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of theore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores beingmined today).Paul F.

 16Message-ID: <EfpX7WS00Uh7QAoP1S@andrew.cmu.edu>NNTP-Posting-Host: po5.andrew.cmu.eduHi,    I was reading through "The Spaceflight Handbook" and somewhere inthere the author discusses solar sails and the forces acting on themwhen and if they try to gain an initial acceleration by passing close tothe sun in a hyperbolic orbit. The magnitude of such accelerations heestimated to be on the order of 700g. He also says that this is may notbe a big problem for manned craft because humans (and this was publishedin 1986) have already withstood accelerations of 45g. All this is verylong-winded but here's my question finally - Are 45g accelerations infact humanly tolerable? - with the aid of any mechanical devices ofcourse. If these are possible, what is used to absorb the acceleration?Can this be extended to larger accelerations?Thanks is advance...-Amruth Laxman

It ispossible only because Mount Everest is at a fairly low latitude:  thereis a slight equatorial bulge in the atmosphere -- beyond what is inducedby the Earth's rotation -- thanks to the overall circulation pattern ofthe atmosphere (air cools at poles and descends, flowing back to equatorwhere it is warmed and rises), and this helps just enough to make Everest-without-oxygen feasible.  Only just feasible, mind you:  the guys who didit reported hallucinations and other indications of oxygen starvation,and probably incurred some permanent brain damage.-- SVR4 resembles a high-speed collision   | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoologybetween SVR3 and SunOS.    - Dick Dunn  |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry

 111      Ethnocentric USian that I am, I've assumed that we and thexUSSR were the only countries with significant capabilities to tracknon-cooperative objects in low Earth orbit. Grazing in a couple of databases recently,  I found that Japan has some optical capabilitiesalong this line, and also uses a radar designed for other purposesfor orbital debris surveys (it isn't clear whether the radar can determine orbital elements for the objects it detects). Abstracts of the articles are appended.     This leads to the more general question: do yet other people than the US, Russia, and Japan do space surveillance, and if so, how and why?

In Japanese, with abstract in English.     This paper reports the optical tracking results of EGS(experimental geodetic satellite) which was launched on August 13,1986, by NASDA. The EGS optical tracking experiment process and anoutline of the Radio Research Laboratory (RRL) optical ground       <----station are discussed. A star tracking technique for opticalequipment calibration and satellite tracking technique for orbitprediction improvement are also described. The accuracy of EGStracking data obtained by RRL at the request of NASDA is alsodiscussed.

RPN: AIAA PAPER 90-1343     Distributions of orbital debris versus height and scattering cross section are determined from a series of observations made with a high-power VHF Doppler radar (MU radar) of Japan. An automated data processing algorithm has been developed to discriminate echoes of orbiting objects from those of undesired signals such as meteor trail echoes or lightning atmospherics. Although the results are preliminary, they showed good agreement with those from NORAD tracking radar      <----observations using a much higher frequency. It is found that the     <----collision frequency of a Space Station of 1 km x 1 km size at an altitude of 500 km with orbiting debris is expected to be as high as once per two years. Monitoring of the MU radar antenna pattern by Satellite Ohzora (EXOS-C)SATO, T.; INOOKA, Y.; FUKAO, S. (Kyoto Univ., Japan); KATO, S.Kyoto Univ., Uji (Japan). Radio Atmospheric Science Center.In International Council of Scientific Unions, Middle Atmosphere Program.Handbook for MAP, Vol. 20 5 pPublication Date: Jun. 1986      As the first attempt among MST (mesosphere stratosphere troposphere) type radars, the MU (middle and upper atmosphere) radar features an active phased array system. Unlike the conventional large VHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed to individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier feeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast beam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the antenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal division/combination are performed at a low signal level using electronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna beam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the zenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element is crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful calibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna element was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for this purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to make a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern monitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific satellite OHZORA (EXOS-C). A receiver named MUM (MU radar antenna Monitor) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400 watts transmitted from the MU radar. The principle of the measurement and results are discussed.Equatorial radar systemFUKAO, SHOICHIRO;  TSUDA, TOSHITAKA; SATO, TORU; KATO, SUSUMU(Kyoto University, Uji, Japan)(COSPAR, IAGA, SCOSTEP, et al., Plenary Meeting, 27th,Workshops and Symposium on the Earth's Middle Atmosphere,Espoo, Finland, July 18-29, 1988) Advances in Space Research(ISSN 0273-1177), vol. 10, no. 10, 1990, p. 151-154.     A large clear air radar with the sensitivity of an incoherent scatter radar for observing the whole equatorial atmosphere up to 1000 km altitude is now being designed in Japan. The radar will be built in Pontianak, West Kalimantan, Indonesia (0.03 deg N, 109.29 deg E). The system is a 47-MHz monostatic Doppler radar with an active phased array configuration similar to that of the MU radar in Japan, which has been in successful operation since 1983. It will have a PA product of about 3 x 10 to the 9th W sq m (P = average transmitter power, A = effective antenna aperture) with a sensitivity of approximately 10 times that of the MU radar. This system configuration enables pulse-to-pulse beam steering within 20 deg from the zenith. As is the case of the MU radar, a variety of operations will be made feasible under the supervision of the radar controller. A brief description of the system configuration is presented.

Of course, it gets harder todo as we work our way farther away from Earth.  We're just starting towork out to the outer planets: Galileo will orbit Jupiter, and Cassini around Saturn.  >How about a mission (unmanned) to Pluto to stay in orbit and record things>around and near and on Pluto.. Well first things first. We'll do a flyby mission first since it ismuch easier and faster to do.

Orbitinsertion requires more fuel has to be carried along and restricts thetrajectory to a slower approach velocity to Pluto.I'd imagine though that we would be doing a Neptune orbitingmission before a Pluto orbiting mission, unless the Pluto flyby turnsup something really interesting.     ___    _____     ___    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

 40To All -- I thought the net would find this amusing..  From the March 1993 "Aero Vision" (The newsletter for the Employeesof McDonnell Douglas Aerospace at Huntington Beach, California).    SPACE CLIPPERS LAUNCHED SUCCESSFULLY    "On Monday, March 15 at noon, Quest Aerospace Education, Inc.  launched two DC-Y Space Clippers in the mall near the cafeteria.  The first rocket was launched by Dr. Bill Gaubatz, director and  SSTO program manager, and the second by Air Force Captain Ed  Spalding, who with Staff Sgt. Don Gisburne represents Air Force  Space Command, which was requested by SDIO to assess the DC-X for  potential military operational use.  Both rocket launches were  successful.  The first floated to the ground between the cafeteria  and Building 11, and the second landed on the roof of the  cafeteria.    Quest's Space Clipper is the first flying model rocket of the  McDonnell Douglas DC-X.  The 1/122nd semi-scale model of the  McDonnell Douglas Delta Clipper has an estimated maximum altitude  of 300 feet.  The Space Clippers can be used in educational  settings to teach mathematics and science, as well as social  studies and other applications.  The Space Clipper is available  either in the $35 Space Clipper outfit, which includes everything  needed for three launches, or as individual rockets for $12 each.  Both are available through hobby shops or by calling 1-800-858-  7302."  By the way -- this is not an endorsement to buy the product nor isit an advertisement to buy the product.  I make no claims about theproduct.

 124McDonnell Douglas rolls out DC-X        HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. -- On a picture-perfect SouthernCalifornia day, McDonnell Douglas rolled out its DC-X rocket ship lastSaturday.  The company hopes this single-stage rocket technologydemonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)rocket ship.        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White SandsMissile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start inmid-June.        Although there wasn't a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast forSSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60million for the DC-X -- can't itself afford to fund full development of afollow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required fora sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister governmentagencies.        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs fororbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recentchanges in SDI's political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTOless of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X asa step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,said Col.  Simon "Pete" Worden, SDIO's deputy for technology.  But Wordendeclined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for theprogram. "I didn't make colonel by telling my contractors how much money Ihave available to spend," he quipped at a press conference at McDonnellDouglas Astronautics headquarters.        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program's orbitalobjective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the "better,faster, cheaper" approach to hardware development.  The agency believesthis philosophy can produce breakthroughs that "leapfrog" ahead ofevolutionary technology developments.        Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a "build a little, test alittle" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He saidthe program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --showed how today's engineers could move beyond the "miracles of ourparents' time."        "The key is management," Worden said. "SDIO had a very light handon this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable."        Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden saidlean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will becrucial. "It's essential we do not end up with a large managementstructure where the price goes up exponentially."        SDIO's approach also won praise from two California members of theHouse Science, Space and Technology Committee. "This is the directionwe're going to have to go," said Rep.  George Brown, the committee'sDemocratic chairman. "Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren'tsustainable....NASA hasn't learned it yet.  SDIO has."        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown's Republican colleague, went further.Joking that "a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,"Rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if itwere left to the civil space agency.        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnellDouglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-stagedrockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. "Let's notbuild fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let's build a spaceship!"         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO's sponsorship, he said theprivate sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.        McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with itsC-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautiousabout a large private secotro commitment. "On very large ventures,companies put in seed money," said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas'senior vice president for space systems. "You need strong governmentinvestments."        While the government and industry continue to differ on fundingfor the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach todevelopment.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to DouglasAircraft's DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way forthe DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry couldeventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will "expand the envelope"of performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  Thefirst tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticletake-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000feet.        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The finaltests will include a "pitch-over" manever that rotates the vehicle backinto a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles "Pete"Conrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing.Now a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehiclesaircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automatedcheck-out and access panels for easy maintainance.        If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology willbecome a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than thePratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquidhydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds ofthrust        Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 modelhas a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-onthrottling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapidturnaround.        Worden said future single-stage rockets could employtri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union.The resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff andthen switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.        The mechanism for the teaming may already be in place.  Pratt hasa technology agreement with NPO Energomash, the design bureau responsiblefor the tri-propellant and Energia cryogenic engines.

How many opticalastronomers are *really* going to be impacted?3) Which is more important; adding a few extra days of'seeing' for (very few) optical astronomers or getting the data thesensors are supposed to return along with the data for largeinflatables (and the potential there for an inflatable space station)?The choice would seem to be one or the other, since the advertising isbeing used to help fund this thing.4) If your answer to 3) above was "the astronomers", then feelfree to come up with some other way to fund the (to my mind) moreimportant research data that would be gained by this WITHOUT SPENDINGANY MORE OF MY MONEY TO DO IT.

 16Question: what is the power spectrum of the bursts. Are their sharp lines?If so, can they be interpreted as blue-shifted atomic or molecular lines?Can electron-positron annihilation gammas be seen in the bursts? Are theyred shifted or blue shifted?Since the bursts are isotropic and maybe in the galactic halo they maybe saying something about dark matter in the halo.If the bursts are something like the cosmic black body radiation fromway back then where are the red shifts - I mean cosmological red shifts?Consider a wild idea - what if the bursts are advanced photons from thefuture rather than retarded ones from the past. Would advanced photonsfrom far future when universe was considerably more expanded getblue shifted as they propagate to younger states of the universe?

 234 ETHER IMPLODES 2 EARTH CORE, IS GRAVITY!!!  This paper BOTH describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary, ether sucking structures, AND why we observe "orbital" motion!!  Ether, the theoretical propogation media of electro-magnetic waves, was concluded not to exist, based on the results of the Michelson-Moreley experiment conducted a century ago.   I propose that those conclusions are flawed, based on the fact that the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the earth's surface, not perpindicular. (Due to the prevailing assumption that the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)  The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the development of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications of BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!  REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!  1  I dream like this: ether based reality   The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations start as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the latticesboth drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it, converting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy. (non-spinning lattice = "dark matter")  The earth isn't exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image of a galaxy; we haven't any videos of them spinning. Picture us being stationary, and the sun's image being dragged across the sky by the spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is spinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner kernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a faster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground of the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but its "foot print" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])    The moon isn't exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self spin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth's ether field, which is itself in the sun's much more powerful field. Our seasons are the wobble of earth's axis, like a top slowing down. The "orbit" of theearth around the sun is all of the stars' images being dragged aroundby the sun's ether feild.  The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and "distance" apart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because the "path" is not the same. The moon's lattice in the ether is like sticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half turn. The sun's lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has got the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a "j" hook at the end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the whole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there.   With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon can be about as big as "earth's" shadow upon it, and at other times totally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge, would you guess that they are about the same size, just because they look about the same size?   O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S E       /     \\                M    |      |      OR                M             \\ _ _ /                                S                                    The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rateof ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating "turntable view" of the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I've seen a half moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the day. Try and draw that "earth shadow.") Its only the moon's image which appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is the part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away from the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.  "Light-Years" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is closer to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase of reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion. (defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be essentially happening now. The "piece" of light may have experienced many years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.  To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to de-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design a propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like trying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)  To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I'd look in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just might carry decipherable data. I'd start looking on some part of the spectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+ billion humans?) I'd totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG backwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card for Pentium!)  Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound media, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I would try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which I'd start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole. [Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a two foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I could get with my machine's receiver next to it.    If you don't think you'll live to see it, consider this: QUIT PUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of life's data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our thoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By eating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant instructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or biblical guys did live hundreds of years. I'm curios to see what they did and ate. Don't worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we don't need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and that is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where did the household concept 'immortal' come from? Wheat is a weed, it is programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then die)  Warning about writing to the past:I had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel future, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from. There were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an Oscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us, and then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the others into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by "advising" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into reproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that the little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to provide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it in his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his control. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying that there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve souls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was finite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in our reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it seemed odd, but we couldn't remember how else it should be. Then some of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no more, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped through his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that he had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body, existing only on the wind.   MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls whose will's are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat others as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a lonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for playmates. (its not eternal, there's more than one way back)  Accepting rides to the past:Once here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a Prince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go ahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry. I Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes your work, but thinks you're getting wise, he can direct you to cross paths with your old self, and you'll vanish as you rewrite your own course of history, none the wiser.  As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped back in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still make changes while he's here, its just that that is work, and with every 'adjustment', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which loosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less. But he can't see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had to apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand to retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers.   How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country, our money, and they're spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this: Washington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to congress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks are making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big corporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the banks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but mostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14 hours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time to buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If we are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if the point is just to keep the people busy making widgets?   In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, "its chaos!" They said, "no, its order." He defined chaos as that which is he was not able to control.  Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy would hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no language. (telepathic; and 'vanishing' the closest knowledge of death)(think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and pointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably naive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should be able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about. They can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers might have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a different frequency than us as they aren't eating seeds.  Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a huge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat only fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and need a lot less sleep.  UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The troops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill each other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)  Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot tall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they suck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that they aren't dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life.   Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women and children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut from the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think that there may be some very interesting results to this, such as mother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples of this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.  That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. He tells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which the people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) He'll play a poker face up until he thinks he's cornered, and then he'll whine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you're willing to live on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was right, and he didn't over play his hand, and he won't need to go back and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over your destiny, just don't live along a path that leads to a reality in which you don't want to be a part of.   I don't claim to be the first to think these things, its just that the others could have been 'pruned' from our path. Maybe these thoughts given to me were laid down on the track of time, after him.

Although initiallyenormously expensive to culture,  within 3 years,the price had fallen at least two orders of magnitude,and within 10 years,  was  not much more expensive thenaspirin.  Penicillin was also usable for an amazingly wideclass of infections.Centoxin is a drug that is not passing FDA approval.  It promisedamazing results for Toxic shock, a rapidly fatal disease.It consumed enormous amounts of funding  in testing anddevelopement,  However it works  less then 1 in 5 timesof administration  and costs $2,000 per administrationwith no promise of any reduction in manufacturing cost.The drug thus costs $10,000 per useful case,  and isimplicated in a slight increase in mortality for somepatients.I would not dare to compare the shuttle to Pennicillin,but to centoxin.pat

The Centaur that is being built for T4 would be a better bet to integrate onto the Proton as the T4/Centaur is designed for the Extremely Harsh envorinment of the T4 launch. It is also closer to 4 m in diameter. You've hit on the real kicker, however. The Centaur is pressure stabilized. It cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks. Additionally, the pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to ~+/- 5 psi. That is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train. The pressure stabilization is how centaur achieves the performance. On numerous occasions(when I was there 88-91) the AF wanted to see what it would take to make a non-pressure stabilized centaur. The answer -- a centaur not worth launching. The Atlas/Centaur does not require on-pad integration, however the T4/Centaurdoes. I believe the on-pad integration is to a great extent due to the cleanliness requirements and PFL configuration, so maybe something can be done there........|> |> They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads |> (unless the new Proton second stage is actually built), and of course|> any Centaur support systems and facilities, no doubt imported from the|> US at great cost.

The addition of LOX/LH facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it lifts off. A LHe facility is also needed. I don't know what the proton uses for fuel, but since they are derived from ICBM's I would suspect that they use storable propellants which don't have the ullage problem that cryo's do. If there is no cryo at the sight at all, the addition of these systems could be big $$, not to mention the real tech transfer issues involved with providing centaur GSE to Russia. That issue alone might be enough to kill this idea. -- H.D.

Like fuelfor re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc.  Even still, if thecontest participants had to fund DC-1 development, it probably wouldn't beworth it to develop DC-1 (just for the contest).  Just give me the cheapestheaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If Idon't have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I'll use it.But back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about alow cost (it's all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A GeneralDynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upperstage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering twounmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. Total cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9billion for the US share.I didn't find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I'd bet thatits  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metrictonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crewhabitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes forthe additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* beable to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,that's a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoorseats up a bit of LOX.  And I'm not certain if a home brewed (orcollege-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let's roundthis up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 tonpayloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, twoLEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for ayear.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way ofdelivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyonehave a more precise guess about how much a year's supply of consumables andequipment would weigh?And I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discardedto burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled? Henry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10engines.  Aren't they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1? I've forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for theDC-1.All in all, I'm not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on themoon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the firstnon-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a mannedmoon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables fromlunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Findsome way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goalmight result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appearedto win.  And for those that didn't give up, I find something a little scaryabout a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I'dlike to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.Lastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was anEnglish space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases onthe cheap.  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the humanbody produced, how much lunar material it'd need for protection from solarflares, etc.  Unfortunately I don't remember the name of this magazine.

There is no evidence thatsigns of life found in old rock predate putative planet-sterilizingevents.  Rather, the argument was that if life arose shortly the laststerilizing event, then it must be easily formed.  The *inference*was that life originated before and was destroyed, but there wasno evidence of that.However, even this argument is flawed.  It could well be that origin oflife requires specific conditions (say, a certain composition of theatmosphere) that do not last for long.  So, perhaps life formedearly only because it would have had no other chance to do so,not because it was likely that life would originate under thoseconditions.Paul F. Dietzdietz@cs.rochester.edu

From what I've heard, they had some chemical (I assume itwas tetrafluoroethylene) in a tank and but the valve got gummed up.Cutting it open revealed that it had polymerized.The material was useful for seals, but it had a major problem for, saythe linings of vessels: it wouldn't stick to metal.

 51Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts.  Forexample, Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a "safe"mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and ifmaybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economygets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  For that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments"turned off" rather than just "safed".  Was it political (i.e.as along as they could be used, someone would keep buggingcongress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them peskyscientists out of the bureaucrat's hair....  I've heard the argument that an active but "uncontrolled"spacecraft causes "radio noise."  I find that hard to believethat this could be a problem in a properly designed "safe" mode.This safe mode could be a program routine which causes thespacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.At that time, if funding has been restored, the mission cancontinue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back tothe safe mode for another time period. As we would know when thespacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could beprepared if necessary.  As another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact isbeam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,great, if not, so it's lost and no big deal.By making the time and signal location generally known, perhapssomeone in the world might be able and willing to intercept thedata even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft.I see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft whichcould have an otherwise long life and are in or are going toplaces which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit,exiting the solar system, etc).   Perhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,etc) should consider designing in a "pause" mode in case theirspacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion ofthe primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo couldhave some kind of routine written in for the post mission"drift" phase.So any holes in all this?/~~~(-: James T.

 13I'm wondering if "vandalize" is the proper word to use in this situation.  Mydictionary defines "vandalism" as "the willful or malicious destructuion of public or private property, especially of anything beautiful or artisitc." Iwould agree the sky is beautiful, but not that it is public or private property.I personally prefer natural skies, far from city lights and sans aircraft.  However, there is also something to be said for being able to look up into thesky and see a satellite.

 77ANNOUNCEMENT:The "HyperKnowledge" PROJECT for NeXTSTEPMotivationWe are a heterogeneous group of scientists and students who feel that our  work is continuously hindered by computer environments dominated by  incompatible scientific tools and monstrous software packages (too often  claiming to do everything).  Rather than being able to use different tools  together in a flexible, interactive system, we find ourselves spending too  much time converting between different data formats, writing throw-away  tools and I/O parsers, and worrying about how to get to a particular goal  rather than what it means to have attained it.What we need is an object-oriented scientific environment where the tools  we choose to use are integrated without being parts of a closed system,  highly interactive, and extendable (both by the addition of our own  specialized objects and by combining the available tools - graphically).   The use of such an environment should be a natural extension of our work,  requiring a very short learning phase and practically no  user-documentation.  The user should feel encouraged to explore different  possibilities, testing his/her own scientific ideas without worrying too  much about whether the system is able to cope (within reason, of course).   By building an open and object-oriented system, each user should be able  to draw upon and combine those tools necessary or conducive to a  particular task: we all need to organize and archive our data, display  results, and combine information from many different sources.Currently, the group consists of people from very different fields:  Molecular Biology, Computer Science, Physics and Astronomy, and Geography.   While many of our needs for such an environment diverge, the underlying  motivation is the same: no matter what you want to call it, we need a  system which helps rather than hinders the organization of our scientific  data and daily work.Why NeXTSTEP?What else is there?  No other system offers the same power, a totally  object-oriented developers environment, UNIX-compatibility,  highly-interactive and standardized user-interface.  With the advent of  NS486 and the expectation that NeXTSTEP will soon appear on a broad range  of hardware platforms, such a system will soon be nearly universally  available.  Classical workstation vendors (SUN, IBM, HP, and the rest) now  have little to offer, no similar tools exist for the standard X-Windows  GUI, if Apple had a system it would only run on their hardware, and the  mass-market Windows/DOS world is a developer's nightmare (either despite,  or more probably because of, OLE).In order to progress, we need an open discussion of how best to develop  such an environment.  In NeXTSTEP parlance, do we simply have to put  together a set of scientific protocols and a common API for our  "Hyper-knowledge" servers? Should be use distributed objects?  What  minimum set of tools do we need in order to start working with the  environment?  What tool-needs do we all have in common and which ones are  best developed by specialized sub-groups?  How many already existing tools  can/should be integrated into the system (e.g. Mathematica)?  Do we need  an "AVS"-like tool for data-flow manipulation?Mailing list and Anonymous ftpIn order to take part to the project or to push the discussion forewords,  you are invited to subscribe to: sci-tools@embl-heidelberg.deAll (interesting) suggestions, projects and sources will be archive and  soon available (anonymous ftp).For questions send mail to sci-tools-help@embl-heidelberg.deAcknowledgmentsThe European Molecular Biology Laboratory (Heidelberg, Germany) has  consented to provide the computer resources for a mailing list and  anonymous ftp services.Rick Hessman    <hessman@eden.uni-sw.gwdg.de>Georg Tuparev   <tuparev@embl-heidelberg.de>

I've admired both his paintings (remember the USPS Solar SystemExploration Stamps last year?) and his writings on the history ofspaceflight.  For several years he's been working on a *big* projectwhich is almost ready to hit the streets.  A brochure from hispublisher has landed in my mailbox, and I thought it was cool enoughto type in part of it (it's rather long).  Especially given the Net'sstrong interest in vaporware spacecraft...                 ==================================                         The Dream Machines:An Illustrated History of the Spaceship in Art, Science, and Literature                            By Ron Miller                  with Foreword by Arthur C. ClarkeKrieger Publishing CompanyMelbourne, Florida, USAOrig. Ed. 1993Pre-publication $84.50ISBN 0-89464-039-9This text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and atechnological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing thespace betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in thetlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot makesuch a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realizedthat there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted toreach them.   Tracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient,attempts to solve this problem also reflects the history oftechnology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travelbecame feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developedthan ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for thatmatter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reasonas the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accuratereflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, andknowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, aswell as selected events important in developing the idea ofextraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronologicalentries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events andspeculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons betweensimultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They revealconnections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Everyentry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly everyspacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  Thisallows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualizedifferences, similarities, and influences.This text will be of interest to students of astronautical history,and also to model builders who would be interested in the schematicdiagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs andhistorians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  Theunique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive andvery interesting history of the spaceship.SPECIAL FEATURESIncludes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real andfictionalContains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photoscontemporary with the subject.  This includes extremely rareillustrations from scarce books and novels, exclusive photos anddrawings fromSoviet spacecraft; rare stills from both famous andobscure science fiction films, and unpublished photographs from NASAarchivesAn index, bibliography, and appendices are included.CONTENTSPart I  The Archaeology of the Spaceship (360 B.C. to 1783 A.D.)Part II The invention of the Spaceship (1784-1899)Part III The Experimenters (1900-1938)Part IV The World War (1939-1945)Part V  The Golden Age of the Spaceship (1946-1960)Part VI The Dawn of the Space Age (1961 to the present)ABOUT RON MILLER[The brochure has a page of stuff here; I'll try to hit the highspots.]Former art director for Albert Einstein Planetarium  at Smithsonian'sNational Air and Space MuseumMember of International Association for Astronomical Arts, member ofInternational Astronautical Association, Fellow of the BritishInterplanetary Society,  consulting editor for *Air & SpaceSmithsonian* magazineAuthor, co-author, editor, or sole illustrator on many books since1979, including *Space Art*, *Cycles of Fire*, *The Grand Tour*, andmany others, as well as many articles and papersBook jackets and interior art for over a dozen publishers Contributor to IBM traveling exhibition and book *Blueprint for Space*Production illustrator for movies *Dune* and *Total Recall*Designer of ten-stamp set of commemorative space postage stamps forU.S. Postal Service in 1991 (Solar System Exploration)ORDERING INFORMATIONPre-publication price $84.50 before 1 May 1993Afterwards, price will be $112.50Krieger Publishing CompanyPO Box 9542Melbourne, FL 32902-9542USADirect order line (407)727-7270Fax (407)951-3671Add $5.00 for shipping by UPS within USA for first book, $1.50 for eachadditional book.

 89SSF is up for redesign again.  Let's do it right thistime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:[1] microgravity/vacuum process research[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)[3] spacecraft maintenence The old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was tocentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meettheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users took most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to tie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganizationand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on thesetwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvementin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial users have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the constellation.  Firstly, different functions are broken down into different constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:thus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,comsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the taskis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed.SSF's 3 main functions require quite different environmentsand are also prime candidates for constellization.[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:COMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab forshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area isinexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities on Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelabto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.We might also expand the research program to take advantage of interesting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt or gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system canbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a station is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,but also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiationenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelterof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, sinceastronauts will have little practical use in the space programuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, usingastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,and the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellationtether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravityin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of theradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,Earth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life supportmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VRinterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,follow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,testing out the actual environment at low cost before $billionsare spent on astronauts.[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in Clarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperatedrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers canpractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stucksolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,inject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can bespun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsatcompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.By applying the successful constellation strategy, and gettingrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, wehave radically improved the capability of the program whilegreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,we can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can studylife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety of space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuumresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purposeorbits.N.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space explorationas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  Mars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously we can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be usedto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting andsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology canbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecologygreenhouses on Mars at low cost.-- Nick Szabo szabo@techboook.com

David gives good explaination of the deductions from the isotropic,   'edged' distribution, to whit, they are either part of the Universe or   part of the Oort cloud.   Why couldn't they be Earth centred, with the edge occuring at the edge   of the gravisphere? I know there isn't any mechanism for them, but there   isn't a mechanism for the others either.What on Earth is the "gravisphere"?Anyway, before it's decay the Pioneer Venus Orbiterhad a gamma ray detector, as does Ulysses, they detect the brightest bursts that the Earth orbit detectorsdo, so the bursts are at least at Oort cloud distances.In principle four detectors spaced out by a few AU wouldsee parallax if the bursts are of solar system origin._The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutelyno plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would haveto involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to"conventional" Oort sources is a model of B-field pinchingby comets, it's got too many holes in it to count, but atleast it was a good try...*  Steinn Sigurdsson   Lick Observatory      **  steinly@lick.ucsc.edu"standard disclaimer"  **  The laws of gravity are very,very strict**  And you're just bending them for your own benefit - B.B. 1988*

I know this is kinda off the subject of sci.space, but not really, I want toanswer this for their, as well as everyone else's information.  What thesepeople are proposing, by and large already exists and can be purchased today.It is called labview by National Instruments.  IT is a wonderful objectoriented graphical programming language.  IT has been implemented onboth Mac's PC's and VME unix boxes.  IT is fare superior to any programmingapproach that I have ever seen and allowed us to decrease the softwaredevelopment time for our shuttle payloads by 90 percent.  This program isnot dependendant on specific hardware and already has exensive analysis capability.Why re-invent the wheel on a platform that may not exist? It is a greatidea but look out there at what is available today.  The Hydrogen leak onthe Shuttle was found using this software. All SSME control and simulationstudies, along with the real testing at MSFC is handled with LabVIEW.  Thereare tons of applications, with the ability to create "virtual" instrumentsthat can accomplish any specific custom task the maker desires.  With theaddition of IEEE-488 support, the computer becomes a virtual control station,allowing the graphic representation of remote instrumentation. With serialI/O support that instrument can be anywhere.  The ground control softwarefor the main control of SEDSAT 1 will utilize this approach.Dennis, University of Alabama in Huntsville

In order to turn thespacecraft back on, you either need to insure that the Ops guys will beavailable, or you need to retrain a new team.Having said that, there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed.Many of the operational satellites Goddard flies (like the Tiros NOAA series) require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set.Extras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into a "standby" mode foruse in an emergency.  In that case, however, the same ops team is stillrequired to fly the operational birds; so the standby maintenance isrelatively cheap.Finally, Pat's explanation (some spacecraft require continuous maintenanceto stay under control) is also right on the mark.  I suggested a spin-stabilized control mode because it would require little power or maintenance, but it still might require some momentum dumping from timeto time.In the end, it *is* a political decision (since the difference is money),but there is some technical rationale behind the decision.David W. @ GSFC

The prefix "peri-" is Greek, not Latin, so it's usually usedwith the Greek form of the name of the body being orbited.  (That's whyit's "perihelion" rather than "perisol", "perigee" rather than "periterr",and "pericynthion" rather than "perilune".)

(818) 354-5011Contact:  Mary A. HardinFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993#1506     Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory report thesuccessful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed tomeasure and study chemicals in the Earth's ozone layer.     The April 3 flight from California's Barstow/Daggett Airportreached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and tookmeasurements as part of a program established to correlate datawith the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).       The data from the balloon flight will also be compared toreadings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy(ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttleDiscovery.     "We launch these balloons several times a year as part of anongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is activelyinvolved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in threeimportant ways," said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator onthe balloon research campaign.       "There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite," hecontinued.  "The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists,and the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truthfor those activities, as well as data that is useful in its ownright."     The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add morepieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically themid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. Understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helpsscientists construct more accurate computer models which areinstrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.     The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPLinstruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measuresozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwaveradiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fouriertransform infrared interferometer which monitors how theatmosphere absorbs sunlight.      Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-hour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130kilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to groundstations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m.Pacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commandedto separate from the balloon.     "We needed to fly through sunset to make the infraredmeasurements," Margitan explained, "and we also needed to fly indarkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear."     It will be several weeks before scientists will have thecompleted results of their experiments.  They will then forwardtheir data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard SpaceFlight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARSscientists.         The balloon was launched by the National Scientific BalloonFacility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under acontract from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon waslaunched in California because of the west-to-east wind directionand the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.     The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less thanone-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubicmeters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated withhelium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weighbetween 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  Thescientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) poundsand is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.     The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA's UpperAtmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative MeasurementsProgram.                                                      #####     ___    _____     ___    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | Being cynical never helps /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | to correct the situation |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | and causes more aggravation                                                  | instead.
 29The SDIO has "contracted" with the NRL (Naval Research Laboratory) to fly the Clementine Mission.  BTW we call it DSPSE (Deep Space Project Science Experiment).The NRL is building the spacecraft, designing the detailed mission and doing theintegration and operations (with help from, JPL & Goddard & prob. some folks Ihave left out...don't be mad).I am on the TAMP (Trajectory Analysis & Mission Planning) team and am responsablefor the IV&V of the traj that Goddard/CSC are designing.As for why SDIO is doing it, some of the reasons are:   1)  the safety constraints are too tight to try to run the LIDAR in LEO   2)  in LEO we don't get any new radiation data on the sensors, we will get       that data on our 9 passages through the Van Allen (sp?) Belts   3)  since we are going out there...why not piggy-back some general science   4)  the intercept problem is a lot easied over LONG distances and LONG timesI am sure there are some things I have forgotten, and some I haven't been toldbut, those are the reasons we all talk about.--                                              Jim Blackshear                                             jib@bonnie.jsc.nasa.gov

However, if they are in the halo, in order  that they appear isotropic, the "core radius" of the halo (i.e. the  innermost region of the halo) has to be greater than about 50 kpc. The halo itself would stretch much further than this.  Since the  Andromeda Galaxy is only 700 kpc away, we should be seeing bursts from that galaxy's halo, which we aren't.js> If the bursts are something like the cosmic black body radiation fromjs> way back then where are the red shifts - I mean cosmological red shifts? Remember to get a redshift, one needs some type of emission or  absorption line so one can compare the observed line frequency  to the rest line frequency.

Please spread the word!  Here's someinformation about the events, and then a couple of messages from JayGoguen of JPL appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse tolearn more about the thermal properties of Iapetus.

Because the Sun's size projected on the rings as seen fromIapetus is 3100 km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new aboutthe rings themselves from the observations.  See Soma (1992), Astronomyand Astrophysics 265, L21-L24 for more details.  Thanks to Andy Odellof Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to myattention.THERMAL OBSERVATIONS?Jay Goguen (jdg@scn5.Jpl.Nasa.Gov) writes:  To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July  disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia,  etc.  Unfortunately, the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible,  except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3  airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with  a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something  to do?  I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.  Jayand again:  please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet  disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would  be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and  getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a  good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't  think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are  well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One  possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m.jay     ___    _____     ___    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

 56Reading from a Amoco Performance Products data sheet, theirERL-1906 resin with T40 carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressivestrength of 280,000 psi.  It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in,therefore the theoretical height for a constant section columnthat can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft,or 75 Statute miles.Now, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a trusstype, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength.Let us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical strength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constantsection column.  A constant section column is not the limit on how high you canbuild something if you allow a tapering of the cross sectionas you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 poundload to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity incalculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column crosssectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structurebelow the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile below the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.The next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross sectionto support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mileof structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the wayto the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoreticallimit on area, although there will be practical limits basedon how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and howmuch load you need to support on the ground (for which you needa foundation that the bedrock can support.Let us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costructioncost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites,assuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figureis just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload massratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the towerheight becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significantatmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will stillhave to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losseswill be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component ofrocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity,but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thusthey represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets startingfrom the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.This analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider windloads.  These will require more structural support over the first15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a lowenough value for it not to be a big factor.Dani Eder-- Dani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/Rt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.

 132In the New York Times on Sunday May 9th in the week in reviewsection there was a report of a group called "Space Marketing"in Atlanta, Georgia who is planning to put up a one mile widereflective Earth orbiting satelite which will appear as largeand as bright as the Moon and carry some sort of advertising.There was an editorial about this in the Times the followingTuesday.Are others as upset about this as I am?  I feel that a globalboycott of anyone involved with such a project would be a goodidea.  Perhaps it could be made illegal in various countriesaround the world?

Many different observations, including IRAS> and COBE, have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures> can range from 40K to 150K.Interstellar grains are not at all close to blackbodies.  The "large"grains have sizes of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light withfair efficiency.  However, at temperatures below 100 K, 90% of thethermal emission will be beyond 22 microns, where radiatingefficiency is poor.  (A small antenna cannot easily radiate at longwavelengths.)  Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiatethe energy they have absorbed.Moreover, the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of 100microns.  Grains colder than 30 K will radiate primarily at longerwavelengths, and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them.  Inthe extreme limit, grains as cold as 5 K will be almost undetectableby any conceivable observation.Worse still, IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by apopulation of "small" grains.  These grains have only perhaps 50atoms, and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up totemperatures of several hundred or 1000 K.  Of course they coolquickly and then stay cold for a while, but _when they are radiating_the characteristic temperature is several hundred K.  Even a smallpopulation of these grains can dramatically raise the observed"average" temperature.A model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data hasthree components.  These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacaldust (color temperature 5500 K), thermal emission from Zodiacal dust(Tc = 280 K), and thermal emission from Galactic dust (Tc=25 K).  Atthe ecliptic poles, the emissivities or dilution factors arerespectively 1.9E-13, 4E-8, and 2E-5.  The first two are roughlydoubled in the ecliptic plane.To find the thermal equilibrium temperature, we add up the dilutionfactor times the fourth power of temperature for all components, thentake the fourth root.  In the table below, starlight comes fromAllen's number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalentto 460 zero mag stars with B-V color of 0.75.  No doubt careful workcould do much better.  (The person who suggested starlight had adilution factor of E-4 must have been remembering wrong.  We would becooked if that were the case.  In any event, the energy density ofstarlight comes out about the same as that of the microwavebackground, and I believe that to be correct.)                         Dilution   Temp.

 44People who criticize "big Government" and its projects rarely seem tohave a consistent view of the role of Government in science andtechnology.  Basically, the U.S. Government has gotten into the role ofsupporting research which private industry finds too expensive or toolong-term.  (Historically, this role for the U.S. Gov't was forced upon it becauseof socialism in other countries.  In order for U.S.  industries tocompete with government-subsidized foreign competitors, the U.S. Gov'thas taken on the role of subisizing big-ticket or long-lead R&D.)As a Republican, I abhor the necessity for our Government to involveitself in technology this way.  I believe that market forces shoulddrive technology, and the world would be a better place for it.  Butthe whole world would have to implement this concept simultaneously, orsome countries would have subsidized R&D, while others would not.  Sothe U.S. must subsidize because everybody else does.  (This sounds alot like the farm subsidies arguments behind our GATT negotiations,doesn't it?)But this role of Government subsidies is antithetical tocost-effectiveness.  The general idea is to spend money on newtechnology, and thereby maintain and promote our technological culture,despite the forces in the business world (like the dreaded quarterlyearnings report) which erode the ability of U.S. industry to invest innew technology.  And since our goal is to spend money, it makes littlesense to try to save money.Of course, we could always spend our money more wisely, but EVERYBODYdisagrees about that the wisdom should be.  It's interesting to note that some of our best tools for cost controlavailable in industry today were derived from Government projects.GANTT charts, CP/M, and most of the modern scheduling software comesfrom DoD projects and their contractors.  The construction industryhas taken these tools to the core of their businesses; every largeconstruction project now uses these tools.  -- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office      kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368     "A scientist can discover a new star, but he cannot make one.

Putting a satellite as high as possible is one thing. Coming back to not only that altitude, but matching the position of it in its orbit on a subsequent mission is another thing.  Any misalignment of the plane of the orbit during launch or being ahead or behind the target will require more fuel to adjust.  This was considered in the original deployment. I agree though that the demands on the crew and complexity are stupendous.  One has to admire how much they are trying to do. Wm. Hathaway Baltimore MD

It is, however, closely regulated. In order to purchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to beone of the following:a) An employee of a government agency.b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets.c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved inresearch or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations: The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry.Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in constructionand flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are:- Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on thelocation, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL. - The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraftwithin the operating radius around the launch site.- Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited.- The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace thatunmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year)are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over thewestern deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popularsince it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members'use, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback isfrom 50 to 500 or more feet. By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an "F" motor are exempt frommost Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, SubpartC, for details.As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typicalrocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute,or multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carryeither a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launchesin the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.Camera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.>And no, I'm not going to even think of buying one.  I'm not that crazy.Why not? It's a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rocketsfor information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everythingbigger) rocket hobbies.

 112Distribution: worldMessage-ID: <23APR199317383221@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov>NNTP-Posting-Host: kelvin.jpl.nasa.govKeywords: VLBI, JPLNews-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41    From the "JPL Universe"April 23, 1993VLBI project meets with international space agenciesBy Ed McNevin     Members of JPL's Space Very Long Baseline Interferometry(VLBI) project team recently concluded a week-long series ofmeetings with officials from Russia and Japan.     The meetings were part of "Space VLBI Week" held at JPL inearly March and were intended to maintain cooperation betweeninternational space agencies participating in the development ofthe U.S. Space VLBI Project, a recently approved JPL flightproject set for launch in 1995.     U.S. Space VLBI will utilize two Earth-orbiting spacecraft-- the Japanese VSOP (VLBI Space Observing Program) satellitewith its 8-meter radio telescope, and a Russian RADIOASTRON10-meter satellite. Both spacecraft will team up withground-based radio telescopes located around the world to createa radio telescope network that astronomers hope will expand radiotelescope observing power by a factor of 10.     Japan's VSOP satellite will use a limited six-hour orbit toconduct imaging science, while the Russian RADIOASTRON spacecraftwill exploit a larger, 28-hour Earth orbit to conduct exploratoryradio astronomy. Each satellite will point at a source target forroughly 24 hours, while approximately 20 ground-based radiotelescopes will simultaneously point at the same source objectwhile within view on Earth.     According to Dr. Joel Smith, JPL's project manager for theU.S. Space VLBI, meetings like those held at JPL will permitJapan and Russia, who have little previous experience in radiointerferometry, to establish working relationships with the radioastronomy communities that will be vital during the complexobservations required by the Space VLBI project.     "One of our main activities is developing the methodologyfor international coordination, because the two spacecraftsimultaneously rely on the corresponding tracking stations whileusing the ground-based radio telescopes to observe the samecelestial objects," said Smith.     Three new tracking antennas are being built at DSNfacilities and other three other tracking facilities located inJapan, Russia and Green Bank, W.Va. This global network ofground-based radio telescopes will use precision clocks andhigh-speed recorders to collect observation data and forward theinformation to a correlator located at the National RadioAstronomy Observatory in Socorro, N.M. The correlator willcombine and process data, then make it available to missioninvestigators in Moscow, Tokyo, and JPL via electronic mail.     Smith is optimistic that the massive radio telescope createdby the Space VLBI network will provide radio astronomers withbetter resolution than has ever been achieved before byground-based radio telescopes, allowing astronomers to take acloser look at distant objects in space.     "There is a long history of radio astronomy usingground-based telescopes," said Smith. "What we intend to do is toextend radio astronomy into Earth orbit. Our goal is to lookdeeper into the cores of galactic nuclei, quasars and otheractive radio sources to understand what drives those things wehave seen so far with radio astronomy."     Smith noted that if one examines "the active galacticnuclei, you'll find jets appearing to spew at speeds greater thanlight, and at energy levels that are millions of times greaterthan you would expect."     He said some astronomers believe that black holes may belocated in the cores of these galaxies, and that they may fuelthe jets. Smith hopes that "by using Space VLBI to look furtherinto the cores, this theory may be supported or disproved."     Russian space-flight hardware, including transponders andtransmitters, are now being tested in the United States, andJapanese hardware is scheduled to arrive for testing later thisyear. Analysis of this hardware will permit U.S. scientists andengineers to understand how to modify the high-speed VLBACorrelator operating at the NRAO in order to accommodate the odddata patterns that will originate from the more than 20ground-based radio telescopes involved in Space VLBI.     Smith is particularly pleased that meetings with theJapanese and Russian space agency officials -- like those held atJPL in March -- have proceeded smoothly. Yet he knows that thepolitical uncertainty in Russia could jeopardize that country'sparticipation in the project.     "Nothing is ever smooth," he said, "but the Russians havebeen incredibly open with us. We always anticipated somelikelihood that we will not succeed because of political factorsbeyond our control, yet there tends to be a way of keeping thesethings going, because scientists on both sides are trying hard,and people recognize the value of cooperation at this level."     Smith points out that the Japanese space agency has more atstake than just fulfilling an international commitment to ascience mission.     "The Japanese have been extremely cooperative, sinceinternational cooperation is essential to their science mission,"he said.     But Smith also noted that Japanese space agency officialslook at the U.S. Space VLBI mission as an opportunity to showcasethe technology involved with VSOP spacecraft, and their highlyregarded Mach V launch vehicle.     Yet regardless of the risks involved in undertaking such anambitious project, JPL's Smith is satisfied that planning for theSpace VLBI Project is beyond the significant financial andpolitical hurdles that otherwise might threaten the project.

My ears felt (not heard) a rush and I couldfeel fluid moving in my head (like when you get up from bed whileyou have a cold).At that point, I ceased to concentrate on my physiological response,since I had some science to do.  I was busy keeping my experimentgoing and keeping track of all the parts during the "return" ofgravity and subsequent 1.8-G pull-out, so I didn't really payattention to physiology at that time.After about 5 parabolas, I discovered that I was performing oneof the tricks I've discovered to keep myself from getting motionsickness; I was keeping my head very still and moving very slowly-- all except my hands and arms, which needed to be in rapid,concious motion for my experiment.  During the pull-out toparabola 5, my queasiness finally started to get to me, and Ihad to use one of those air-sickness bags.  I was basicallyuseless for the rest of that flight, so I went to the seats inthe back of the plane while my partner (whom I drafted for justthis purpose) kept working on the experiment while I was ill.(He was a vetran Vomit Comet rider, one of those anomalouspeople who don't get sick on the thing.)I didn't think of it as a "constant sensation of falling" somuch as like swimming in air.

 35The European Space Agency has involvement with remote earth observation, and I presume this includes surveillance (optical etc.).So it's not just the US/USSR(ex) who are in the game.But what *is* the game? What can be done with space observation?The military functions of missile spotting, troop spotting etc. are welldocumented, but what about anything else?The biggest eg I can think of is to get a  metal sensing sat over apaying country and scan their territory for  precious metals.More importantly, if radar can spot water vapour (clouds), presumablya radar based sat will be capable of spotting rivers,open water and *underground water* from space. This would be a positive life saverfor African or other drought affected countries. Implementing aclean water and irrigation program would be of imense benifit to suchcountries and should cut down mortalities considerably.So how about it?

It would have   to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to   "conventional" Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching   by comets, it's got too many holes in it to count, but at   least it was a good try...So you have a plausible model for GRB's at astronomical distances?Recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron starhypothesis, which had a lot of problems, anyhow.  We have to look forimplausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent ofmodels.A paper on the possibility of GRB's in the Oort cloud just camethrough the astrophysics abstract service.  To get a copy of thispaper, send a message to astro-ph@babbage.sissa.it with the subjectline   get 9304001Here is the abstract of that paper.   The currently favored explanation for the origin of \\GRBs puts them   at cosmological distances;   but as long as there is no distance   indicator to these events all possible sources which are   isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is   why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list,   although there is no known mechanism for generating \\GRBs   from cometary nuclei. Unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that \\GRBs   originate in the solar cometary cloud   cannot be excluded until it is disproved.   We use the available data on the distribution of \\GRBs (the BATSE   catalogue up to March, 1992), and   the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits  by Marsden and Williams (1992) to   investigate whether there is any observational indication for correlations   between the angular distributions of \\GRBs and comets' aphelia,   assuming that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect,   at least to some extent, true variations   in the column density of the Oort cloud. We also apply the $\\vov$   test to both distributions.   We have  performed a variety of statistical tests (a Kolmogorov-Smirnov   test for the distributions in galactic latitude, a   $\\chi^2$ test for the spherical multiple moments, and a 2-D   cross-correlation analysis), including testing sub-samples for   isolating the effect of possible observational biases.   These tests imply that it is unlikely that the two distributions agree, but   the statistical significance  is not sufficient for ruling out any   connection with complete confidence. We performed Monte-Carlo simulations   which show that only when the number of bursts exceeds $\\sim 800$   it is possible to rule out a correlation between the angular distributions.   Currently,    it is only the combination of these tests  with the large disagreement   found for the $\\vov$ parameter which makes the Oort   cloud of comets unlikely to be related to \\GRBs.

The difference is in the directionof the acceleration.  For pilots, accelerations tend to be transverse tothe direction you're facing (pulling out from a steep dive, theacceleration will force blood toward your feet, for instance).  In thiscase, you can only put up with about 8 g's even with a pressure suit.  The record for acceleration, though, is measured along "the directionyou're facing" (for lack of a better term).

 82Nntp-Posting-Host: guitar.ucr.eduThere is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today'sLA Times (Thursday April 15, 1993, p. D1).  I thought I'd post it tostir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it bysaying that I largely agree that the "Space Age" in the romantic senseof several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space stationmiss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, "What's New" -the weekly physics update we get here on the net - it's clear that theromance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation ofmatter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (withits spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing thingspeople are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, Ithink, the romance some people still have with space is a matter ofnostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our "mindchildren" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); butI think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting aboutwhat we can do *now*.   Anyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...SPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEWMicheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)At 35, America's Space Age won't have to suffer through the angst of amidlife crisis.The reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies nolonger define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion-dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economicrewards.  Space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America's scienceand technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not ameaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, ourtechnology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversionpolicy.  To be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologiesfor telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probeswould be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver ofscientific and industrial innovation is now dead......Before the change in administrations, it would have been foolish towrite an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressivelysupported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billionto build space station Freedom alone.Even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspokenpublic champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that muchof the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescopeto the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressivelyimplemented did not seem to matter much.Political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherentvision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollarspace budgets.Indeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apolloera is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space explorationwith programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  ......While the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded DanielGoldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration, it seems clear that space exploration is not beingpositioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America'stechnological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - beenslashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration championsits competitiveness agenda......."I wish this had happened 10 years ago instead of starting to happennow," says Bruce Murray, a Caltech professor who ran NASA's JetPropulsion Lab in Pasadena.  "We've put off a lot of things we shouldn'thave.... I would rather see a $10-billion NASA doing well than a$40-billion one filled with white elephants."

It's true that a hydraulicallypressurized tube can be somewhat more rigid than an unpressurized tube,but even at 2000 PSI levels a hydraulic hose will bend rather easily,though it's straight-on compressive strength is high, and it's torsional resistance increase is practically nil. On the other grasping member, there's no doubt that hydraulic "leverage" exists in nature. Tree roots are an example.

I don't think so. If you take the view that thetail is a limb, then monkeys and kangaroos are 5-limbed. I think thetail is a different kind of structure, grossly enlarged in the caseof the kangaroo, but primarily still an instrument of balance ratherthan locomotion.

First let me say that when I say "intelligent"I mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a levelwith, or greater than, human tool use and tool building. IE assumingsuitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter it's enviroment in a planned way, it will do so. That's certainly nota universal or complete definition of intelligence, but it will sufficefor a putative technological alien.Now no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought, butit's generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain levelof complexity. This is generally determined by the number of neuroncells, and their interconnections. So a creature the size of a lemurwouldn't have enough neurons to support complex thought. This argumentis considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur. There's roomfor a large brain, though no indication that one ever developed. Onereason this may be true is neuronic speed. The electrochemical messages that trigger neurons require time to propagate. This makes it difficultfor a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of verylarge creatures. So there's little selection pressure for such brains.Instead, a simpler distributed network evolves. This doesn't rule outintelligent dinosaurs, but it points in that direction.Then there are the thermodynamic arguments. A tiny creature like thelemur needs to eat frequently because it's internal heat is rapidlylost due to it's high surface to volume ratio. I contend that a creaturethat must spend most of it's time and energy feeding won't have the timeto develop and exercise intelligence. That argument may be somewhat weak.The dinosaur's problem is the reverse, it must moderate it's heat production because it's high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat. I'm assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemicalreactivity reasons for productive neuron function. So creatures wouldtend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near thatof humans if they are carbon based. That tends to rule out cold bloodedcreatures as potential homes of intelligence. Some people contend thatsome of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded. But for a creaturethe size of a brontosaur, it's activity levels would have to be restrainedor it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from thewaste heat. Whales are similar size, but they can reject heat to theocean, a much more efficient sink than air. I suspect that for intelligenceto manifest itself, a certain degree of activity in interacting with theenvironment is necessary. IE monkey curiousity. I doubt a large dinosaurwould be capable of that much activity.Gary-- Gary Coffman KE4ZV          |    You make it,     | gatech!wa4mei!ke4zv!garyDestructive Testing Systems |    we break it.     | uunet!rsiatl!ke4zv!gary534 Shannon Way             |    Guaranteed!      | emory!kd4nc!ke4zv!gary Lawrenceville, GA 30244     |                     |
 133In the April edition of "One Small Step for a Space Activist",Allen Sherzer & Tim Kyger write:  "Another problem is what are called 'wraps' (or sometimes   the 'center tax'). When work for a large program like   Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the   center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts   to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the   center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to   be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about   that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10   billion won't be spent on anything having anything   to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion   was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn't), but the work done   with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting   the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the   existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the   term 'center tax'. They look at the Station they are   getting and the price they are paying and note that   it doesn't add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware   that a third of the money is going for something else."My dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A coupleof weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, Italked with one of the cost experts here in Space Stationat Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn't post aresponse immediately, I do have a real job I'm supposedto be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHzdata & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty lowon the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekendin Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers Association conference, extolling the virtues of SSFto 15,000 science teachers.]First off, yes, the concept of 'center tax', or 'wrap' doesexist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total 'tax'for the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million.This was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4center 'taxes'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at$2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is04/2.2 = 1.8%Over the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30billion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to$540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but Iwill concede it's still an appreciable amount of pocketchange.I should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 couldbe close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on fundsthat are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at somestates, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eatthe food at the restaurant, but you don't if you get ittake-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the fundswe receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT*subject to the center tax (I don't have the numbers infront of me, but I'd guess at least 95% of the WP-4 fundsgo to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a taxrate of 1/3, but it's only applied to funds spent at thecenter, and not to the prime contracts.This leads to the obvious question "What is the governmentdoing with SSF funds that don't go to the prime contractors?(i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. Abig portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happensto the balance of the funds, which aren't eatenup by the center tax?)"At WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supportingdevelopment funds (as they are supporting the developmentwork done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds tosetup our own testbed, to checkout the electricalpower system architecture. Our testbed has a real lifesolar array field (left over from solar cell researchresearch a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries(to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DCswitchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulatedloads. Data from the testbed was used in a recentchange evaluation involving concerns about the stabilityof the power system.We have also used the supporting development money topurchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on lifetesting at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility inIndiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells ontest recently hit the four year life test milestone.38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (theon-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).As a final example, my 'home' division at Lewis usedthe supporting development funds to purchase personalcomputers and work stations, for performing systemanalyses (like modeling of the performance of theelectrical power system, availability calculationsusing a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a database with information on weight of the powersystem elements).Finally, the money raised by the 'tax' does not allgo into a 'slush fund.' At Lewis, the directordoes control a small discretionary fund. Each year,any individual at Lewis can submit a proposal tothe director to get money from this fund to lookat pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.Most of the tax, however, goes to fund the 'general'services at the Center, like the library, the central computer services division, the Contractor who removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is ratherdifficult to determine what percentage of theSSF budget doesn't go for SSF activities. To getan accurate figure, you would have to takethe annual expenditure for the library (for example),and then divide by the amount of the library fundsused to support SSF (which would be hard tocompute by itself - how would you figure outwhat percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for1 year is 'billable' to SSF, would you base it onthe person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-weekversus the rest of the center personnel). You wouldthen have to compare this estimate of the SSFportion of the library expense with the portion ofthe tax that goes to support the library. Who knows,maybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, butwe underpay for snow removal? Talk abouta burecratic nightmare!My last point is that I can't believe your claim thatCongress has never heard of the term 'center tax.'Unfortunately, all of the NASA testimony beforeCongress isn't on a computer, so I can't do a simpleword search someplace to prove you wrong. But surely,in some GAO audit somewhere, these NASA cost methodswere documented for Congress?

I don't have a calculator, but I DO have the problem set thatwe did not too long ago, so I'll use that, and hope it's what you wanted.  This is a highly simplified problem, with a very simple burst.  Bursts areusually more complex than this example I will use here.        Our burst has a peak flux of 5.43E-6 ergs cm^-2 sec^-1 and a durationof 8.95 seconds.  During the frst second of the burst, and the last 4 seconds,its flux is half of the peak flux.  It's flux is the peak flux the rest of thetime.  Assume that the background flux is 10E-7 erg cm^-2 sec^-1.        Then we had to find the integrated luminosity of the burst, for severaldifferent spheres: R=.25pc(Oort Cloud Radius), R=22.5pc(at the edge of thegalaxy), R=183.5pc or the edge of the galactic corona, and lastly at aR=8800Mpc.          We integrated the flux over all time to find the fluence, then used theold standby formula:                        Luminosity=4(pi)(r^2)Fpeak        For a radius of .25 pc, we found an L around 10^32 erg/sec.  Prettyenergetic for close by.  for the coronal model, we found around 10^43 erg/sec.And lastly, for the cosmological model an L=10^53. That's what you'd callmoderately energetic, I'd say.  Any suggestions about what could put out thatmuch energy in one second?                                                 -jeremy

(3) Sprout one group in distilled water on filter paper                    for three or four weeks.               (4) Separately incinerate both groups.               (5) Weigh the residue from each group.  [The residue of                    the sprouted group will usually weigh at least                    SEVERAL PERCENT MORE than the other group.]               (6) Analyze quantitatively the residue of each group for                    mineral content.

Ingesting a source of organic silicon (silicon with           carbon, such as "horsetail" extract, or radishes) can SPEED           HEALING OF BROKEN BONES via the reaction Si + C --> Ca, (much           faster than by merely ingesting the calcium directly).                           Some MINERAL DEPOSITS in the ground are formed by micro-          organisms FUSING together atoms of silicon, carbon, nitrogen,           oxygen, hydrogen, etc..                          The two reactions Si + C <--> Ca, by micro-organisms,           cause "STONE SICKNESS" in statues, building bricks, etc..                           The reaction N2 --> CO, catalysed by very hot iron,           creates a CARBON-MONOXIDE POISON HAZARD for welder operators           and people near woodstoves (even properly sealed ones).

Mitchell                          March 23, 1993 INTRODUCTION: In order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, areal miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to testtele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individualslocated world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainmentpurposes.Not only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation andtele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing ofinformationon methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout ofalunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminatingeducational information, providing contests and awards for creativity andachievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate inTwenty-First century remote learning methods. Because of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interestsandskills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures,interfacingand electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolvingplayground and laboratory that can be used by children, students andprofessionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal ata participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models attheLTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a realfacilityexists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of theconstructionof the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggestedby the users themselves. This has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups: - tele-operations and virtual reality research - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers - art and theater - bbs and online network users - software and game developers - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains - children - the child in all of us LTM1 OVERALL DESIGN: A room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are usedfor murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth.The "floor" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributionsis hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design andcreation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, andmachine-lets.  The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets: 1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land; 2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and 3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.  Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals. The first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trainswith TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and controlelectronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user willreceive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of theirdata link to LTM1. Next, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from aservo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for theSSTOto be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunarlandscape and land. Finally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equippedbulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operatorsworldwideto receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing andtakeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based oncommerciallyavailable items and parts that can be easily obtained except for theinterface electronics which is well within the capability of many advancedham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers. By taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and addinga tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can beprovided in under 80 man hours. PLAN OF ACTION: The Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project byproviding a host computer network and Internet access to that network.Diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual constructionof the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can bemodified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide "rail stock"for the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphicalcommunications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets.An initial "ground breaking" with miniature shovels will be performed fora live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initialmodels will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started forhistorical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completelyserious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additionalbuilding, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present andthe photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distributionworld-wide to major online networks and bbs's. A press release will beissuedcalling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scalemodelsfor the simulated lunar colony. A contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will thenbeannounced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being tofind instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects ofthe lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at thattimethe results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors willthen be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they returntotheir campus. A monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and viaconventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipmentaddition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media.Having a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photoopportunity for the television community. Especially since the "action"willbe controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will beinvited to issue "challenges" to engineering and human factors students atuniversities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to performlunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may besimulated to some extent to try various traction challenges. The long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education,experimentationand remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being alongterm global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the genericexample of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limitedto space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which canlead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars! CONCLUSION: EduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who hasever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of aglobally available layout for recreation, education and experimentationpurposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only createworld-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that requirereal(not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people's minds inspace.

Space ScienceDept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sailproposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen togenerate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out atthe meeting. Here goes : The Microlight Solar Sail-------------------------1. IntroductionThe solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure ofsunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such avehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than mostpeople realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram persquare kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminizedfabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' typespacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hteidea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.2.DesignRecent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: atiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purelybe electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude controlmethods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on apanel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed atEdinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and datagathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control andcommunication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surfaceof the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost ofthe mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.3.MissionsThe craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example:a) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amorgroups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bitrate.b) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobservedareas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail toreflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receivesunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm thatvolatiles such as water ice have become trapped in theselocations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunarbase, BTW]c) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or cometnucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craftcauses it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edgedtube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as anideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heatis reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300deg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulatingcontainer.Contact: Colin Jack                              Tel. 0865-200447Oxford Mathematical Designs, 131 High Street, Oxford OX1 4DH, England--------------------------------This guy would love to hear from anyone interested in this project orseeking details or anything, and would be most happy to send you moreinformation.Andy--                                   ----------------------------------- Andy Jonathan J.

 57NNTP-Posting-Host: max.u.washington.edu  Yesterday, I went to the Boeing shareholders meeting.  It was a bit shorterthan I expected.  Last year (when the stock was first down), they made a bigpresentation on the 777, and other programs.  This year, it was much morebare-bones.In any case, I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors wouldhear, and so I got there early, and figured that If I didn't get to the mike,maybe they would read mine off of a card, and so I wrote it down, and handed itin.After the meeting started, Mr. Shrontz said that he would only answer writtenquestions, in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that onlyhad monitors downstairs.  Naturally, I was crushed.So, when question and answer time came, I was suprised to find my questionbeing read and answered.  Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took.Presumably getting there early, and getting the question in early made allthe difference.So, on to the substance. The question was Is Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport, suchas a commercial space launch system, and if not, how will Boeing competewith the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developedby Mcdonnell Douglass?Well, he read it without a hitch, and without editing, with impressed me,then he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question, lastpart first.This is to the best of my recollection what he said.As far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have a betteranswer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some of our customers about that.  As far as commercialization, that is a long ways off.  The Highspeed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes atthis point.So, this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a non-commercialarena, and for the most part this is true, however it also tells me that they consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for themto persue work on their own.Now, I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing.  Actually,this is a mis-nomer, as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that thisguy is doing, however, he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for spacelifter contracts.  He won't tell me what he is doing, but maybe this is wherethe TSTO action is taking place at boeing.  At the very minimum, the chairmanof the board of boeing said that they have an approach in mind, and they aretrying to do something with it.  Anybody know anything further?Is this really news?Does this threaten further work on DC-? ?                    John.

Pluto and Charon have much more extreme axialtilt and a much longer orbit.  Pluto's north pole, for example, gets overa century of darkness followed by over a century of perpetual light.At the moment, we're in luck -- Pluto and Charon are just past theirequinox, when the Sun was just on the horizon at both poles (of each).If we get probes there soon, only the immediate vicinity of one pole(on each) will be in long-term shadow.

So, if the 1/r^2 law is incorrect (assume   some unknown material [dark matter??] inhibits Gamma Ray propagation),   could it be possible that we are actually seeing much less energetic   events happening much closer to us?  The even distribution could   be caused by the characteristic propagation distance of gamma rays    being shorter then 1/2 the thickness of the disk of the galaxy.I believe the problem with this theory is that we see gamma-raysources at that energy range and their energy doesn't seem to besignificantly absorbed.

Indeed they were worried about that.  One concern was the possibility thatthey would lose a motor or something on the way up, and make orbit but onethat was too low to give HST a useful lifetime against atmospheric drag.  I believe the decision was to deploy HST even if the projected lifetime wasas short as six months.  In fact we got an excellent orbit, on the upperenvelope of what the Shuttle can do.I have never heard of any serious consideration that HST might be brought down for refurbishment.  You would have the horrendous cost of transporting,cleaning, re-testing, and re-certifying all the hardware on the ground, inaddition to the lost observing time and the cost of a second deployment mission with the risks that we might not get such a good orbit the second time.  And, you would probably STILL need a (third) servicing mission in a few years as gyros and other components wear out.  Better to have two servicing missions in space (which could well happen) than to bring HST down and take it up again.Ben

However, theconcept of a prize for a difficult goal is done for different reasons, I suspect.  I'm not aware that Mr Orteig received any significant economic benefit from Lindbergh's flight.  Modern analogies, such as the prize for ahuman powered helicopter face similar arguments.  There is little economicbenefit in such a thing.  The advantage comes in the new approaches developedand the fact that a prize will frequently generate far more work than the equivalent amount of direct investment would.  A person who puts up $ X billionfor a moon base is much more likely to do it because they want to see it donethan because they expect to make money off the deal.-- Josh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu    "Find a way or make one."             -attributed to Hannibal

Ancient astronomers observed points oflight that appeared to move among the stars. They called theseobjects planets, meaning wanderers, and named them after Romandeities -- Jupiter, king of the gods; Mars, the god of war;Mercury, messenger of the gods; Venus, the god of love andbeauty, and Saturn, father of Jupiter and god of agriculture. Thestargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, and meteorsor shooting stars apparently falling from the sky.     Science flourished during the European Renaissance.Fundamental physical laws governing planetary motion werediscovered, and the orbits of the planets around the Sun werecalculated. In the 17th century, astronomers pointed a new devicecalled the telescope at the heavens and made startlingdiscoveries.     But the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age ofsolar system exploration. Advancements in rocketry after WorldWar II enabled our machines to break the grip of Earth's gravityand travel to the Moon and to other planets.     The United States has sent automated spacecraft, thenhuman-crewed expeditions, to explore the Moon. Our automatedmachines have orbited and landed on Venus and Mars; explored theSun's environment; observed comets, and made close-range surveyswhile flying past Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.     These travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge andunderstanding of the solar system. Through the electronic sightand other "senses" of our automated spacecraft, color andcomplexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appearedto Earth-bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light.And dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered.     Future historians will likely view these pioneering flightsthrough the solar system as some of the most remarkableachievements of the 20th century.     AUTOMATED SPACECRAFT     The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's)automated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in manyshapes and sizes. While they are designed to fulfill separate andspecific mission objectives, the craft share much in common.     Each spacecraft consists of various scientific instrumentsselected for a particular mission, supported by basic subsystemsfor electrical power, trajectory and orientation control, as wellas for processing data and communicating with Earth.     Electrical power is required to operate the spacecraftinstruments and systems. NASA uses both solar energy from arraysof photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power itssolar system missions. Rechargeable batteries are employed forbackup and supplemental power.     Imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyedmillions of miles through space to fly but one time near aplanet, only to have its cameras and other sensing instrumentspointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target! To helpprevent such a mishap, a subsystem of small thrusters is used tocontrol spacecraft.     The thrusters are linked with devices that maintain aconstant gaze at selected stars. Just as Earth's early seafarersused the stars to navigate the oceans, spacecraft use stars tomaintain their bearings in space. With the subsystem locked ontofixed points of reference, flight controllers can keep aspacecraft's scientific instruments pointed at the target bodyand the craft's communications antennas pointed toward Earth. Thethrusters can also be used to fine-tune the flight path and speedof the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered atthe planned distance and on the proper trajectory.     Between 1959 and 1971, NASA spacecraft were dispatched tostudy the Moon and the solar environment; they also scanned theinner planets other than Earth -- Mercury, Venus and Mars. Thesethree worlds, and our own, are known as the terrestrial planetsbecause they share a solid-rock composition.     For the early planetary reconnaissance missions, NASAemployed a highly successful series of spacecraft called theMariners. Their flights helped shape the planning of latermissions. Between 1962 and 1975, seven Mariner missions conductedthe first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space.     All of the Mariners used solar panels as their primary powersource. The first and the final versions of the spacecraft hadtwo wings covered with photovoltaic cells. Other Mariners wereequipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonalbodies.     Although the Mariners ranged from the Mariner 2 Venusspacecraft, weighing in at 203 kilograms (447 pounds), to theMariner 9 Mars Orbiter, weighing in at 974 kilograms (2,147pounds), their basic design remained quite similar throughout theprogram. The Mariner 5 Venus spacecraft, for example, hadoriginally been a backup for the Mariner 4 Mars flyby. TheMariner 10 spacecraft sent to Venus and Mercury used componentsleft over from the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter program.     In 1972, NASA launched Pioneer 10, a Jupiter spacecraft.Interest was shifting to four of the outer planets -- Jupiter,Saturn, Uranus and Neptune -- giant balls of dense gas quitedifferent from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed.     Four NASA spacecraft in all -- two Pioneers and two Voyagers-- were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solarsystem. Because of the distances involved, these travelers tookanywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations.Barring faster spacecraft, they will eventually become the firsthuman artifacts to journey to distant stars. Because the Sun'slight becomes so faint in the outer solar system, these travelersdo not use solar power but instead operate on electricitygenerated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes.     NASA also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisitour neighbors Mars and Venus in the middle and late 1970s. TwinViking Landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weatherstations and as biology laboratories. Two advanced orbiters --descendants of the Mariner craft -- carried the Viking Landersfrom Earth and then studied martian features from above.     Two drum-shaped Pioneer spacecraft visited Venus in 1978.The Pioneer Venus Orbiter was equipped with a radar instrumentthat allowed it to "see" through the planet's dense cloud coverto study surface features. The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe carriedfour probes that were dropped through the clouds. The probes andthe main body -- all of which contained scientific instruments --radioed information about the planet's atmosphere during theirdescent toward the surface.     A new generation of automated spacecraft -- includingMagellan, Galileo, Ulysses, Mars Observer, the CometRendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini -- is beingdeveloped and sent out into the solar system to make detailedexaminations that will increase our understanding of ourneighborhood and our own planet.     The Sun     A discussion of the objects in the solar system must startwith the Sun. The Sun dwarfs the other bodies, representingapproximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system;all of the planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust and gas add upto only about 0.14 percent. This 0.14 percent represents thematerial left over from the Sun's formation. One hundred and nineEarths would be required to fit across the Sun's disk, and itsinterior could hold over 1.3 million Earths.     As a star, the Sun generates energy through the process offusion. The temperature at the Sun's core is 15 million degreesCelsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit), and the pressure thereis 340 billion times Earth's air pressure at sea level. The Sun'ssurface temperature of 5,500 degrees Celsius (10,000 degreesFahrenheit) seems almost chilly compared to its core-temperature.At the solar core, hydrogen can fuse into helium, producingenergy. The Sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streamsof charged particles, both extending far beyond the planets.     The Sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion yearsand has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years orso. At the end of its life, the Sun will start to fuse heliuminto heavier elements and begin to swell up, ultimately growingso large that it will swallow Earth. After a billion years as a"red giant," it will suddenly collapse into a "white dwarf" --the final end product of a star like ours. It may take a trillionyears to cool off completely.     Many spacecraft have explored the Sun's environment, butnone have gotten any closer to its surface than approximatelytwo-thirds of the distance from Earth to the Sun. Pioneers 5-11,the Pioneer Venus Orbiter, Voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecrafthave all sampled the solar environment. The Ulysses spacecraft,launched on October 6, 1990, is a joint solar mission of NASA andthe European Space Agency. After using Jupiter's gravity tochange its trajectory, Ulysses will fly over the Sun's polarregions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range ofstudies using nine onboard scientific instruments.     We are fortunate that the Sun is exactly the way it is. Ifit were different in almost any way, life would almost certainlynever have developed on Earth.     Mercury     Obtaining the first close-up views of Mercury was theprimary objective of the Mariner 10 spacecraft, launched onNovember 3, 1973, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After ajourney of nearly five months, which included a flyby of Venus,the spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers (437 miles) of thesolar system's innermost planet on March 29, 1974.     Until Mariner 10, little was known about Mercury. Even thebest telescopic views from Earth showed Mercury as an indistinctobject lacking any surface detail. The planet is so close to theSun that it is usually lost in solar glare. When the planet isvisible on Earth's horizon just after sunset or before dawn, itis obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere. Only radartelescopes gave any hint of Mercury's surface conditions prior tothe voyage of Mariner 10.     The photographs Mariner 10 radioed back to Earth revealed anancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling our ownMoon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing theplanet. These apparently were created when Mercury's interiorcooled and shrank, buckling the planet's crust. The cliffs are ashigh as 3 kilometers (2 miles) and as long as 500 kilometers (310miles).     Instruments on Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury has a weakmagnetic field and a trace of atmosphere -- a trillionth thedensity of Earth's atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon, neonand helium. When the planet's orbit takes it closest to the Sun,surface temperatures range from 467 degrees Celsius (872 degreesFahrenheit) on Mercury's sunlit side to -183 degrees Celsius(-298 degrees Fahrenheit) on the dark side. This range in surfacetemperature -- 650 degrees Celsius (1,170 degrees Fahrenheit) --is the largest for a single body in the solar system. Mercuryliterally bakes and freezes at the same time.     Days and nights are long on Mercury. The combination of aslow rotation relative to the stars (59 Earth days) and a rapidrevolution around the Sun (88 Earth days) means that one Mercurysolar day takes 176 Earth days or two Mercury years -- the timeit takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around theSun!      Mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock likethat of Earth. Scientists believe Mercury has a heavy iron-richcore making up slightly less than half of its volume. That wouldmake Mercury's core larger, proportionally, than the Moon's coreor those of any of the planets.     After the initial Mercury encounter, Mariner 10 made twoadditional flybys -- on September 21, 1974, and March 16, 1975 --before control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhaustedand the mission was concluded. Each flyby took place at the samelocal Mercury time when the identical half of the planet wasilluminated; as a result, we still have not seen one-half of theplanet's surface.     Venus     Veiled by dense cloud cover, Venus -- our nearest planetaryneighbor -- was the first planet to be explored. The Mariner 2spacecraft, launched on August 27, 1962, was the first of morethan a dozen successful American and Soviet missions to study themysterious planet. As spacecraft flew by or orbited Venus,plunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on Venus' surface,romantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid torest.     On December 14, 1962, Mariner 2 passed within 34,839kilometers (21,648 miles) of Venus and became the firstspacecraft to scan another planet; onboard instruments measuredVenus for 42 minutes. Mariner 5, launched in June 1967, flew muchcloser to the planet. Passing within 4,094 kilometers (2,544miles) of Venus on the second American flyby, Mariner 5'sinstruments measured the planet's magnetic field, ionosphere,radiation belts and temperatures. On its way to Mercury, Mariner10 flew by Venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to Earthshowing cloud circulation patterns in the Venusian atmosphere.     In the spring and summer of 1978, two spacecraft werelaunched to further unravel the mysteries of Venus. On December 4of the same year, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter became the firstspacecraft placed in orbit around the planet.     Five days later, the five separate components making up thesecond spacecraft -- the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe -- entered theVenusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet. Thefour small, independent probes and the main body radioedatmospheric data back to Earth during their descent toward thesurface. Although designed to examine the atmosphere, one of theprobes survived its impact with the surface and continued totransmit data for another hour.     Venus resembles Earth in size, physical composition anddensity more closely than any other known planet. However,spacecraft have discovered significant differences as well. Forexample, Venus' rotation (west to east) is retrograde (backward)compared to the east-to-west spin of Earth and most of the otherplanets.     Approximately 96.5 percent of Venus' atmosphere (95 times asdense as Earth's) is carbon dioxide. The principal constituent ofEarth's atmosphere is nitrogen. Venus' atmosphere acts like agreenhouse, permitting solar radiation to reach the surface buttrapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back intospace. As a result, the planet's average surface temperature is482 degrees Celsius (900 degrees Fahrenheit), hot enough to meltlead.     A radio altimeter on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter provided thefirst means of seeing through the planet's dense cloud cover anddetermining surface features over almost the entire planet.NASA's Magellan spacecraft, launched on May 5, 1989, has been inorbit around Venus since August 10, 1990. The spacecraft usesradar-mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh-resolution imagesof the surface.     Magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanicfeatures, faults and impact craters. Huge areas of the surfaceshow evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flowslying on top of previous ones. An elevated region named IshtarTerra is a lava-filled basin as large as the United States. Atone end of this plateau sits Maxwell Montes, a mountain the sizeof Mount Everest. Scarring the mountain's flank is a100-kilometer (62-mile) wide, 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) deepimpact crater named Cleopatra. (Almost all features on Venus arenamed for women; Maxwell Montes, Alpha Regio and Beta Regio arethe exceptions.) Craters survive on Venus for perhaps 400 millionyears because there is no water and very little wind erosion.     Extensive fault-line networks cover the planet, probably theresult of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonicson Earth. But on Venus the surface temperature is sufficient toweaken the rock, which cracks just about everywhere, preventingthe formation of major plates and large earthquake faults likethe San Andreas Fault in California.     Venus' predominant weather pattern is a high-altitude,high-speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid. Atspeeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers (225 miles) per hour,the clouds circle the planet in only four Earth days. Thecirculation is in the same direction -- west to east -- as Venus'slow rotation of 243 Earth days, whereas Earth's winds blow inboth directions -- west to east and east to west -- in sixalternating bands. Venus' atmosphere serves as a simplifiedlaboratory for the study of our weather.     Earth     As viewed from space, our world's distinguishingcharacteristics are its blue waters, brown and green land massesand white clouds. We are enveloped by an ocean of air consistingof 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent otherconstituents. The only planet in the solar system known to harborlife, Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of 150 millionkilometers (93 million miles). Earth is the third planet from theSun and the fifth largest in the solar system, with a diameterjust a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus.     Our planet's rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core giverise to an extensive magnetic field, which, along with theatmosphere, shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiationcoming from the Sun and other stars. Earth's atmosphere protectsus from meteors as well, most of which burn up before they canstrike the surface. Active geological processes have left noevidence of the pelting Earth almost certainly received soonafter it formed -- about 4.6 billion years ago. Along with theother newly formed planets, it was showered by space debris inthe early days of the solar system.     From our journeys into space, we have learned much about ourhome planet. The first American satellite -- Explorer 1 -- waslaunched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 31, 1958, anddiscovered an intense radiation zone, now called the Van Allenradiation belts, surrounding Earth.     Since then, other research satellites have revealed that ourplanet's magnetic field is distorted into a tear-drop shape bythe solar wind -- the stream of charged particles continuouslyejected from the Sun. We've learned that the magnetic field doesnot fade off into space but has definite boundaries. And we nowknow that our wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm anduneventful, seethes with activity -- swelling by day andcontracting by night. Affected by changes in solar activity, theupper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on Earth.     Besides affecting Earth's weather, solar activity gives riseto a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When chargedparticles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth's magneticfield, they collide with air molecules above our planet'smagnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and areknown as the auroras or the northern and southern lights.     Satellites about 35,789 kilometers (22,238 miles) out inspace play a major role in daily local weather forecasting. Thesewatchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms. Continuousglobal monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data andcontributes to a better understanding of Earth's complex weathersystems.     From their unique vantage points, satellites can surveyEarth's oceans, land use and resources, and monitor the planet'shealth. These eyes in space have saved countless lives, providedtremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering ourplanet in dangerous ways.     The Moon     The Moon is Earth's single natural satellite. The firsthuman footsteps on an alien world were made by Americanastronauts on the dusty surface of our airless, lifelesscompanion. In preparation for the human-crewed Apolloexpeditions, NASA dispatched the automated Ranger, Surveyor andLunar Orbiter spacecraft to study the Moon between 1964 and 1968.     NASA's Apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materialsand data. Six two-astronaut crews landed on and explored thelunar surface between 1969 and 1972, carrying back a collectionof rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms (842 pounds)and consisting of more than 2,000 separate samples.     From this material and other studies, scientists haveconstructed a history of the Moon that includes its infancy.Rocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4.0-4.3billion years old. The first few million years of the Moon'sexistence were so violent that few traces of this period remain.As a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified intodifferent kinds of rock, the Moon was bombarded by huge asteroidsand smaller objects. Some of the asteroids were as large as RhodeIsland or Delaware, and their collisions with the Moon createdbasins hundreds of kilometers across.     This catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately fourbillion years ago, leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge,overlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and brokenrock. Heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began tomelt the interior of the Moon at depths of about 200 kilometers(125 miles) below the surface. Then, for the next 700 millionyears -- from about 3.8 to 3.1 billion years ago -- lava rosefrom inside the Moon. The lava gradually spread out over thesurface, flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areasthat Galileo Galilei, an astronomer of the Italian Renaissance,called maria, meaning seas.     As far as we can tell, there has been no significantvolcanic activity on the Moon for more than three billion years.Since then, the lunar surface has been altered only bymicrometeorites, by the atomic particles from the Sun and stars,by the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft andastronauts. If our astronauts had landed on the Moon a billionyears ago, they would have seen a landscape very similar to theone today. Thousands of years from now, the footsteps left by theApollo crews will remain sharp and clear.     The origin of the Moon is still a mystery. Four theoriesattempt an explanation: the Moon formed near Earth as a separatebody; it was torn from Earth; it formed somewhere else and wascaptured by our planet's gravity, or it was the result of acollision between Earth and an asteroid about the size of Mars.The last theory has some good support but is far from certain.     Mars     Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solarsystem's prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life.Astronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw whatappeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface. Theseobservations -- later determined to be optical illusions -- ledto the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed asystem of irrigation canals on the planet. In 1938, when OrsonWelles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fictionclassic War of the Worlds  by H.G. Wells, enough people believedin the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic.     Another reason for scientists to expect life on Mars had todo with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet'ssurface. This phenomenon led to speculation that conditions mightsupport a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer monthsand cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods.     So far, six American missions to Mars have been carried out.Four Mariner spacecraft -- three flying by the planet and oneplaced into martian orbit -- surveyed the planet extensivelybefore the Viking Orbiters and Landers arrived.     Mariner 4, launched in late 1964, flew past Mars on July 14,1965, coming within 9,846 kilometers (6,118 miles) of thesurface. Transmitting to Earth 22 close-up pictures of theplanet, the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurringchannels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water.Mariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of1969 and returned 201 pictures. Mariners 4, 6 and 7 showed adiversity of surface conditions as well as a thin, cold, dryatmosphere of carbon dioxide.     On May 30, 1971, the Mariner 9 Orbiter was launched on amission to make a year-long study of the martian surface. Thespacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift-off, only tofind Mars in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm that madesurface photography impossible for several weeks. But after thestorm cleared, Mariner 9 began returning the first of 7,329pictures; these revealed previously unknown martian features,including evidence that large amounts of water once flowed acrossthe surface, etching river valleys and flood plains.     In August and September 1975, the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft-- each consisting of an orbiter and a lander -- lifted off fromKennedy Space Center. The mission was designed to answer severalquestions about the red planet, including, Is there life there?Nobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities, but it washoped that the biology experiments on the Viking Landers would atleast find evidence of primitive life -- past or present.     Viking Lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfullytouch down on another planet when it landed on July 20, 1976,while the United States was celebrating its Bicentennial. Photossent back from the Chryse Planitia ("Plains of Gold") showed ableak, rusty-red landscape. Panoramic images returned by thelander revealed a rolling plain, littered with rocks and markedby rippled sand dunes. Fine red dust from the martian soil givesthe sky a salmon hue. When Viking Lander 2 touched down on UtopiaPlanitia on September 3, 1976, it viewed a more rolling landscapethan the one seen by its predecessor -- one without visibledunes.     The results sent back by the laboratory on each VikingLander were inconclusive. Small samples of the red martian soilwere tested in three different experiments designed to detectbiological processes. While some of the test results seemed toindicate biological activity, later analysis confirmed that thisactivity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet's soilchemistry. Is there life on Mars? No one knows for sure, but theViking mission found no evidence that organic molecules existthere.     The Viking Landers became weather stations, recording windvelocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature andpressure. Few weather changes were observed. The highesttemperature recorded by either craft was -14 degrees Celsius (7degrees Fahrenheit) at the Viking Lander 1 site in midsummer.     The lowest temperature, -120 degrees Celsius (-184 degreesFahrenheit), was recorded at the more northerly Viking Lander 2site during winter. Near-hurricane wind speeds were measured atthe two martian weather stations during global dust storms, butbecause the atmosphere is so thin, wind force is minimal. VikingLander 2 photographed light patches of frost -- probablywater-ice -- during its second winter on the planet.     The martian atmosphere, like that of Venus, is primarilycarbon dioxide. Nitrogen and oxygen are present only in smallpercentages. Martian air contains only about 1/1,000 as muchwater as our air, but even this small amount can condense out,forming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl aroundthe slopes of towering volcanoes. Local patches of early morningfog can form in valleys.     There is evidence that in the past a denser martianatmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet. Physicalfeatures closely resembling shorelines, gorges, riverbeds andislands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet.     Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. They are small andirregularly shaped and possess ancient, cratered surfaces. It ispossible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured tooclose to Mars and were captured by its gravity.     The Viking Orbiters and Landers exceeded by large marginstheir design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days, respectively. Thefirst to fail was Viking Orbiter 2, which stopped operating onJuly 24, 1978, when a leak depleted its attitude-control gas.Viking Lander 2 operated until April 12, 1980, when it was shutdown because of battery degeneration. Viking Orbiter 1 quit onAugust 7, 1980, when the last of its attitude-control gas wasused up. Viking Lander 1 ceased functioning on November 13, 1983.     Despite the inconclusive results of the Viking biologyexperiments, we know more about Mars than any other planet exceptEarth. NASA's Mars Observer spacecraft, to be launched inSeptember 1992, will expand our knowledge of the martianenvironment and lead to human exploration of the red planet.      Asteroids     The solar system has a large number of rocky and metallicobjects that are in orbit around the Sun but are too small to beconsidered full-fledged planets. These objects are known asasteroids or minor planets. Most, but not all, are found in aband or belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Some haveorbits that cross Earth's path, and there is evidence that Earthhas been hit by asteroids in the past. One of the least eroded,best preserved examples is the Barringer Meteor Crater nearWinslow, Arizona.     Asteroids are material left over from the formation of thesolar system. One theory suggests that they are the remains of aplanet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago. Morelikely, asteroids are material that never coalesced into aplanet. In fact, if the estimated total mass of all asteroids wasgathered into a single object, the object would be only about1,500 kilometers (932 miles) across -- less than half thediameter of our Moon.      Thousands of asteroids have been identified from Earth. Itis estimated that 100,000 are bright enough to eventually bephotographed through Earth-based telescopes.     Much of our understanding about asteroids comes fromexamining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface ofEarth. Asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth arecalled meteoroids. When a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere athigh velocity, friction causes this chunk of space matter toincinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor. If themeteoroid does not burn up completely, what's left strikesEarth's surface and is called a meteorite. One of the best placesto look for meteorites is the ice cap of Antarctica.     Of all the meteorites examined, 92.8 percent are composed ofsilicate (stone), and 5.7 percent are composed of iron andnickel; the rest are a mixture of the three materials. Stonymeteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very muchlike terrestrial rocks.     Since asteroids are material from the very early solarsystem, scientists are interested in their composition.Spacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have foundthat the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids areseparated by very large distances.     Current and future missions will fly by selected asteroidsfor closer examination. The Galileo Orbiter, launched by NASA inOctober 1989, will investigate main-belt asteroids on its way toJupiter. The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassinimissions will also study these far-flung objects. Scheduled forlaunch in the latter part of the 1990s, the CRAF and Cassinimissions are a collaborative project of NASA, the European SpaceAgency and the federal space agencies of Germany and Italy, aswell as the United States Air Force and the Department of Energy.One day, space factories will mine the asteroids for rawmaterials.     Jupiter     Beyond Mars and the asteroid belt, in the outer regions ofour solar system, lie the giant planets of Jupiter, Saturn,Uranus and Neptune. In 1972, NASA dispatched the first of fourspacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of thesecolossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock. Jupiterwas the first port of call.     Pioneer 10, which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center inMarch 1972, was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroidbelt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system. InDecember 1973, it returned the first close-up images of Jupiter,flying within 132,252 kilometers (82,178 miles) of the planet'sbanded cloud tops. Pioneer 11 followed a year later. Voyagers 1and 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returnedspectacular photographs of Jupiter and its family of satellitesduring flybys in 1979.     These travelers found Jupiter to be a whirling ball ofliquid hydrogen and helium, topped with a colorful atmospherecomposed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium. Ammonia icecrystals form white Jovian clouds. Sulfur compounds (and perhapsphosphorus) may produce the brown and orange hues thatcharacterize Jupiter's atmosphere.     It is likely that methane, ammonia, water and other gasesreact to form organic molecules in the regions between theplanet's frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lyingbelow. Because of Jupiter's atmospheric dynamics, however, theseorganic compounds -- if they exist -- are probably short-lived.     The Great Red Spot has been observed for centuries throughtelescopes on Earth. This hurricane-like storm in Jupiter'satmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet. As ahigh-pressure region, the Great Red Spot spins in a directionopposite to that of low-pressure storms on Jupiter; it issurrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot andare sometimes consumed by it. The Great Red Spot might be amillion years old.     Our spacecraft detected lightning in Jupiter's upperatmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to Earth'snorthern lights at the Jovian polar regions. Voyager 1 returnedthe first images of a faint, narrow ring encircling Jupiter.     Largest of the solar system's planets, Jupiter rotates at adizzying pace -- once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds. Themassive planet takes almost 12 Earth years to complete a journeyaround the Sun. With 16 known moons, Jupiter is something of aminiature solar system.     A new mission to Jupiter -- the Galileo Project -- is underway. After a six- year cruise that takes the Galileo Orbiter oncepast Venus, twice past Earth and the Moon and once past twoasteroids, the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe intoJupiter's cloud layers and relay data back to Earth. The GalileoOrbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying closeto Jupiter's large moons, exploring in detail what the twoPioneers and two Voyagers revealed.     Galilean Satellites     In 1610, Galileo Galilei aimed his telescope at Jupiter andspotted four points of light orbiting the planet. For the firsttime, humans had seen the moons of another world. In honor oftheir discoverer, these four bodies would become known as theGalilean satellites or moons. But Galileo might have happilytraded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographsreturned by the Voyager spacecraft as they flew past theseplanet-sized satellites.     One of the most remarkable findings of the Voyager missionwas the presence of active volcanoes on the Galilean moon Io.Volcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a worldother than Earth. The Voyager cameras identified at least nineactive volcanoes on Io, with plumes of ejected material extendingas far as 280 kilometers (175 miles) above the moon's surface.     Io's pizza-colored terrain, marked by orange and yellowhues, is probably the result of sulfur-rich materials brought tothe surface by volcanic activity. Volcanic activity on thissatellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by thegravitational tug-of-war between Io, Jupiter and the other threeGalilean moons.     Europa, approximately the same size as our Moon, is thebrightest Galilean satellite. The moon's surface displays acomplex array of streaks, indicating the crust has beenfractured. Caught in a gravitational tug-of-war like Io, Europahas been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt --apparently producing a liquid-water ocean. This ocean is coveredby an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to thecold of space. Europa's core is made of rock that sank to itscenter.     Like Europa, the other two Galilean moons -- Ganymede andCallisto -- are worlds of ice and rock. Ganymede is the largestsatellite in the solar system -- larger than the planets Mercuryand Pluto. The satellite is composed of about 50 percent water orice and the rest rock. Ganymede's surface has areas of differentbrightness, indicating that, in the past, material oozed out ofthe moon's interior and was deposited at various locations on thesurface.     Callisto, only slightly smaller than Ganymede, has thelowest density of any Galilean satellite, suggesting that largeamounts of water are part of its composition. Callisto is themost heavily cratered object in the solar system; no activityduring its history has erased old craters except more impacts.     Detailed studies of all the Galilean satellites will beperformed by the Galileo Orbiter.     Saturn     No planet in the solar system is adorned like Saturn. Itsexquisite ring system is unrivaled. Like Jupiter, Saturn iscomposed mostly of hydrogen. But in contrast to the vivid colorsand wild turbulence found in Jovian clouds, Saturn's atmospherehas a more subtle, butterscotch hue, and its markings are mutedby high-altitude haze. Given Saturn's somewhat placid-lookingappearance, scientists were surprised at the high-velocityequatorial jet stream that blows some 1,770 kilometers (1,100miles) per hour.     Three American spacecraft have visited Saturn. Pioneer 11sped by the planet and its moon Titan in September 1979,returning the first close-up images. Voyager 1 followed inNovember 1980, sending back breathtaking photographs thatrevealed for the first time the complexities of Saturn's ringsystem and moons. Voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons inAugust 1981.     The rings are composed of countless low-density particlesorbiting individually around Saturn's equator at progressivedistances from the cloud tops. Analysis of spacecraft radio wavespassing through the rings showed that the particles vary widelyin size, ranging from dust to house-sized boulders. The rings arebright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock.     The rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing bodyventured too close to Saturn. The unlucky object would have beentorn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in itsinterior. Or the object may not have been fully formed to beginwith and disintegrated under the influence of Saturn's gravity. Athird possibility is that the object was shattered by collisionswith larger objects orbiting the planet.     Unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from eachother, individual ring particles appear to be held in place bythe gravitational pull of Saturn and its satellites. Thesecomplex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringletsthat make up the major rings.     Radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an AMcar radio during an electrical storm were detected by the Voyagerspacecraft. These emissions are typical of lightning but arebelieved to be coming from Saturn's ring system rather than itsatmosphere, where no lightning was observed. As they had atJupiter, the Voyagers saw a version of Earth's auroras nearSaturn's poles.     The Voyagers discovered new moons and found severalsatellites that share the same orbit. We learned that some moonsshepherd ring particles, maintaining Saturn's rings and the gapsin the rings. Saturn's 18th moon was discovered in 1990 fromimages taken by Voyager 2 in 1981.      Voyager 1 determined that Titan has a nitrogen-basedatmosphere with methane and argon -- one more like Earth's incomposition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of Mars andVenus. Titan's surface temperature of -179 degrees Celsius (-290degrees Fahrenheit) implies that there might be water-ice islandsrising above oceans of ethane-methane liquid or sludge.Unfortunately, Voyager's cameras could not penetrate the moon'sdense clouds.     Continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may beconverting Titan's methane to ethane, acetylene and -- incombination with nitrogen -- hydrogen cyanide. The lattercompound is a building block of amino acids. These conditions maybe similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval Earthbetween three and four billion years ago. However, Titan'satmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permitprogress beyond this stage of organic chemistry.     The exploration of Saturn will continue with the Cassinimission. The Cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and willalso deploy a probe called Huygens, which will be dropped intoTitan's atmosphere and fall to the surface. Cassini will use theprobe as well as radar to peer through Titan's clouds and willspend years examining the Saturnian system.     Uranus     In January 1986, four and a half years after visitingSaturn, Voyager 2 completed the first close-up survey of theUranian system. The brief flyby revealed more information aboutUranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned fromground observations since the planet's discovery over twocenturies ago by the English astronomer William Herschel.     Uranus, third largest of the planets, is an oddball of thesolar system. Unlike the other planets (with the exception ofPluto), this giant lies tipped on its side with its north andsouth poles alternately facing the sun during an 84-year swingaround the solar system. During Voyager 2's flyby, the south polefaced the Sun. Uranus might have been knocked over when anEarth-sized object collided with it early in the life of thesolar system.     Voyager 2 found that Uranus' magnetic field does not followthe usual north-south axis found on the other planets. Instead,the field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planet'scenter, a phenomenon that on Earth would be like having onemagnetic pole in New York City and the other in the city ofDjakarta, on the island of Java in Indonesia.     Uranus' atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen, with some 12percent helium and small amounts of ammonia, methane and watervapor. The planet's blue color occurs because methane in itsatmosphere absorbs all other colors. Wind speeds range up to 580kilometers (360 miles) per hour, and temperatures near the cloudtops average -221 degrees Celsius (-366 degrees Fahrenheit).     Uranus' sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind ofphotochemical "smog" believed to be a combination of acetylene,ethane and other sunlight-generated chemicals. Surrounding theplanet's atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers intospace is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as "electroglow."     Approximately 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) below Uranus'cloud tops, there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water anddissolved ammonia some 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) deep.Beneath this ocean is an Earth-sized core of heavier materials.     Voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons, 16-169 kilometers (10-105miles) in diameter, orbiting Uranus. The five previously known --Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon -- range in size from520 to 1,610 kilometers (323 to 1,000 miles) across. Representinga geological showcase, these five moons are half-ice, half-rockspheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of pastactivity, including faulting and ice flows.     The most remarkable of Uranus' moons is Miranda. Its surfacefeatures high cliffs as well as canyons, crater-pocked plains andwinding valleys. The sharp variations in terrain suggest that,after the moon formed, it was smashed apart by a collision withanother body -- an event not unusual in our solar system, whichcontains many objects that have impact craters or are fragmentsfrom large impacts. What is extraordinary is that Mirandaapparently reformed with some of the material that had been inits interior exposed on its surface.     Uranus was thought to have nine dark rings; Voyager 2 imaged11. In contrast to Saturn's rings, which are composed of brightparticles, Uranus' rings are primarily made up of dark,boulder-sized chunks.     Neptune     Voyager 2 completed its 12-year tour of the solar systemwith an investigation of Neptune and the planet's moons. OnAugust 25, 1989, the spacecraft swept to within 4,850 kilometers(3,010 miles) of Neptune and then flew on to the moon Triton.During the Neptune encounter it became clear that the planet'satmosphere was more active than Uranus'.      Voyager 2 observed the Great Dark Spot, a circular storm thesize of Earth, in Neptune's atmosphere. Resembling Jupiter'sGreat Red Spot, the storm spins counterclockwise and moveswestward at almost 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) per hour. Voyager2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast-moving cloud dubbedthe "Scooter," as well as high-altitude clouds over the mainhydrogen and helium cloud deck. The highest wind speeds of anyplanet were observed, up to 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) perhour.     Like the other giant planets, Neptune has a gaseous hydrogenand helium upper layer over a liquid interior. The planet's corecontains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of theother gas giants. Neptune's distinctive blue appearance, likeUranus' blue color, is due to atmospheric methane.     Neptune's magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet'sspin axis and is not centered at the core. This phenomenon issimilar to Uranus' magnetic field and suggests that the fields ofthe two giants are being generated in an area above the cores,where the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes theelectrical properties of a metal. Earth's magnetic field, on theother hand, is produced by its spinning metallic core and is onlyslightly tilted and offset relative to its center.     Voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of Neptune's rings.Observations from Earth indicated that there were arcs ofmaterial in orbit around the giant planet. It was not clear howNeptune could have arcs and how these could be kept fromspreading out into even, unclumped rings. Voyager 2 detectedthese arcs, but they were, in fact, part of thin, complete rings.A number of small moons could explain the arcs, but such bodieswere not spotted.     Astronomers had identified the Neptunian moons Triton in1846 and Nereid in 1949. Voyager 2 found six more. One of the newmoons -- Proteus -- is actually larger than Nereid, but sinceProteus orbits close to Neptune, it was lost in the planet'sglare for observers on Earth.      Triton circles Neptune in a retrograde orbit in under sixdays. Tidal forces on Triton are causing it to spiral slowlytowards the planet. In 10 to 100 million years (a short time inastronomical terms), the moon will be so close that Neptuniangravity will tear it apart, forming a spectacular ring toaccompany the planet's modest current rings.     Triton's landscape is as strange and unexpected as those ofIo and Miranda. The moon has more rock than its counterparts atSaturn and Uranus. Triton's mantle is probably composed ofwater-ice, but the moon's crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen andmethane. The moon shows two dramatically different types ofterrain: the so-called "cantaloupe" terrain and a receding icecap.      Dark streaks appear on the ice cap. These streaks are thefallout from geyser-like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gasand dark, fine-grained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers(1 to 5 miles). Triton's thin atmosphere, only 1/70,000th asthick as Earth's, has winds that carry the dark particles anddeposit them as streaks on the ice cap -- the coldest surface yetfound in the solar system (-235 degrees Celsius, -391 degreesFahrenheit). Triton might be more like Pluto than any otherobject spacecraft have so far visited.     Pluto     Pluto is the most distant of the planets, yet theeccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it insideNeptune's orbit, where it has been since 1979 and where it willremain until March 1999. Pluto's orbit is also highly inclined --tilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets.     Discovered in 1930, Pluto appears to be little more than acelestial snowball. The planet's diameter is calculated to beapproximately 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles), only two-thirds thesize of our Moon. Ground-based observations indicate that Pluto'ssurface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thinatmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planetmoves away from the Sun. Observations also show that Pluto's spinaxis is tipped by 122 degrees.      The planet has one known satellite, Charon, discovered in1978. Charon's surface composition is different from Pluto's: themoon appears to be covered with water-ice rather than methaneice. Its orbit is gravitationally locked with Pluto, so bothbodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other. Pluto'sand Charon's rotational period and Charon's period of revolutionare all 6.4 Earth days.      Although no spacecraft have ever visited Pluto, NASA iscurrently exploring the possibility of such a mission.     Comets     The outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay avisit to the inner planets. As asteroids are the rocky andmetallic remnants of the formation of the solar system, cometsare the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive onlyfar from the Sun. Most comet nuclei reside in the Oort Cloud, aloose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reachingperhaps halfway to the nearest star.     Comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they aregravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them closeto the Sun. As a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outerplanets, the volatile elements of which it is made graduallywarm; by the time the nucleus enters the region of the innerplanets, these volatile elements are boiling. The nucleus itselfis irregular and only a few miles across, and is made principallyof water-ice with methane and ammonia -- materials very similarto those composing the moons of the giant planets.     As these materials boil off of the nucleus, they form a comaor cloud-like "head" that can measure tens of thousands ofkilometers across. The coma grows as the comet gets closer to theSun. The stream of charged particles coming from the Sun pusheson this cloud, blowing it back like a flag in the wind and givingrise to the comet's "tails." Gases and ions are blown directlyback from the nucleus, but dust particles are pushed more slowly.As the nucleus continues in its orbit, the dust particles areleft behind in a curved arc.     Both the gas and dust tails point away from the Sun; ineffect, the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the Sun.The tails can reach 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) inlength, but the total amount of material contained in thisdramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase. Comets --from the Latin cometa, meaning "long-haired" -- are essentiallydramatic light shows.     Some comets pass through the solar system only once, butothers have their orbits gravitationally modified by a closeencounter with one of the giant outer planets. These lattervisitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly returnto the inner solar system.     Halley's Comet is the most famous example of a relativelyshort period comet, returning on an average of once every 76years and orbiting from beyond Neptune to within Venus' orbit.Confirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 B.C. This regularvisitor to our solar system is named for Sir Edmond Halley,because he plotted the comet's orbit and predicted its return,based on earlier sightings and Newtonian laws of motion. His namebecame part of astronomical lore when, in 1759, the cometreturned on schedule. Unfortunately, Sir Edmond did not live tosee it.     A comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passescomparatively close to Earth. Unfortunately, on its most recentappearance, Halley's Comet passed no closer than 62.4 millionkilometers (38.8 million miles) from our world. The comet wasvisible to the naked eye, especially for viewers in the southernhemisphere, but it was not spectacular. Comets have been sobright, on rare occasions, that they were visible during daytime.Historically, comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omensand have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky.     The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) spacecraft willbecome the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus andremain in proximity to it as they both approach the Sun. CRAFwill observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growingsunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off andform a coma and tails. Several spacecraft have flown by comets athigh speed; the first was NASA's International Cometary Explorerin 1985. An armada of five spacecraft (two Japanese, two Sovietand the Giotto spacecraft from the European Space Agency) flew byHalley's Comet in 1986.     Conclusion     Despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances ofspace through an obscuring atmosphere, scientists of the past hadonly one body they could study closely -- Earth. But since 1959,spaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on ourneighbors in space.      We have learned more about our solar system and its membersthan anyone had in the previous thousands of years. Our automatedspacecraft have traveled to the Moon and to all the planetsbeyond our world except Pluto; they have observed moons as largeas small planets, flown by comets and sampled the solarenvironment. Astronomy books now include detailed pictures ofbodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes forgenerations. We are lucky to be alive now to see these strangeand beautiful places and objects.     The knowledge gained from our journeys through the solarsystem has redefined traditional Earth sciences like geology andmeteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline calledcomparative planetology. By studying the geology of planets,moons, asteroids and comets, and comparing differences andsimilarities, we are learning more about the origin and historyof these bodies and the solar system as a whole.     We are also gaining insight into Earth's complex weathersystems. By seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and byinvestigating the Sun's activity and its influence throughout thesolar system, we can better understand climatic conditions andprocesses on Earth.     We will continue to learn and benefit as our automatedspacecraft explore our neighborhood in space. One current missionis mapping Venus; others are flying between worlds and will reachthe Sun and Jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments. Futuremissions are planned for Mars, Saturn, a comet and the asteroidbelt.     We can also look forward to the time when humans will onceagain set foot on an alien world. Although astronauts have notbeen back to the Moon since December 1972, plans are beingformulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for thehuman exploration of Mars and even the establishment of martianoutposts. One day, taking a holiday may mean spending a week at alunar base or a martian colony!- end -

Of course; sorry for the misunderstanding.  I was referring to the factthat far more aeronautical development took place in the '30's.  For muchof the '20's, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down theindustry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retiredand Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the pointwhere long-distance flights became practical.  It's important to note thatthe Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in 1927:  Lindbergh,Chamberlin and Levine, and Byrd's _America_.

Not off the top of my head; I'll have to dig out my reference books again.However, I will say that the most common arrangement in Prince Henry theNavigator's Portugal was for the prince to put up part of the money andmerchants to put up the rest.

The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire aMoon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporationscan even consider putting up.  The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft),Orteig's prize, Lord Northcliffe's prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required werewithin the reach of individual inventors, and the prize amounts were wellwithin the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  I think that onlya gov't could afford to set up a $1B+ prize for any purpose whatsoever.  Note that Burt Rutan suggested that NASP could be built most cheaply bytaking out an ad in AvWeek stating that the first company to build a planethat could take off and fly the profile would be handed $3B, no questionsasked.--  Keith Mancus    <mancus@butch.jsc.nasa.gov>                           | N5WVR           <mancus@sweetpea.jsc.nasa.gov>                        | "Black powder and alcohol, when your states and cities fall,          |  when your back's against the wall...." -Leslie Fish                  |

Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are seen coming equally from all directions.However, given the number of bright ones, there are too few faintones to be consistent with being equally dense for as faras we can see--it is as if they are all contained withina finite sphere (or a sphere with fuzzy edges) with us at thecenter.  (These measurements are statistical, and you canalways hide a sufficiently small number of a differenttype of GRB with a different origin in the data.  I am assumingthat there is only one population of GRBs).The data indicates that we are less than 10% of the radius of the centerof the distribution.  The only things the Earth is at the exact centerof are the Solar system (at the scale of the Oort cloud of cometsway beyond Pluto) and the Universe.  Cosmological theories, placingGRBs throughout the Universe, require supernova-type energies tobe released over a timescale of milliseconds.  Oort cloud modelstend to be silly, even by the standards of astrophysics.If GRBs were Galactic (i.e. distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy)you would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane ofthe Galaxy (for a 'disk' population), or towards the Galactic center(for a spherical 'halo' population).  We don't see this, so if theyare Galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years inradius, and we would probably start to see GRBs from the AndromedaGalaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.)  For comparison, theEarth is 25,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy.>my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering>hyperspace :-)The aren't concentrated in the known spacelanes, and we don'tsee many coming from Zeta Reticuli and Tau Ceti.>but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they>are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered>if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.There are more than 130 GRB different models in the refereed literature.Right now, the theorists have a sort of unofficial moratoriumon new models until new observational evidence comes in.-- David M.

I haven't read enough of either to comment, although>everyone tells me I should read Nietzche.I would have to say that the "greatest philosopher" title would have togo to Plato since the whole enterprise of philosophy was essentiallydefined by him.  Although he got most of his answers wrong, he did definitively identify what the important questions are.  I think itwas Descartes who said that "All philosophy is just a footnote to Plato."If I were to choose which philosopher made the most important advancesin human knowledge over his lifetime, that's simple...it is Aristotle.This is so much the case that many simply refer to him as "the philosopher".Regarding Nietzsche, he's one of the most entertaining, although since hisideas were so fragmented (and since his life was cut short) it is doubtfulthat his influence as a philosopher is likely to be very extensive 500 yearsfrom now.  They'll probably still be reading him in 500 years though.As for "modern" philosophers, I would have to say that Kant was the mostinfluential since he had such a strong influence on almost everyone whocame after him (and unfortunately, they maintained his errors and amplified them over time).I would say that the most influential "american" philosopher would have tobe Dewey.But as to the question of what philosopher will be most highly regarded in500 years, it may very well be Ayn Rand (who in every important respectwas "American", but was born in Russia).  But I guess that remains to be seen.--Brian
 76NASA Headquarters distributed the following pressrelease today (4/6). I've typed it in verbatim, for youfolks to chew over. Many of the topics recentlydiscussed on sci.space are covered in this.Gibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign GuidanceDr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science andTechnology Policy, outlined to the members-designate ofthe Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the SpaceStation on April 3, three budget options as guidance tothe committee in their deliberations on the redesign ofthe space station.A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7billion and a high option of $9 billion will beconsidered by the committee. Each option would coverthe total expenditures for space station from fiscalyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds fordevelopment, operations, utilization, Shuttleintegration, facilities, research operations support,transition cost and also must include adequate programreserves to insure program implementation within theavailable funds.Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved withinthe NASA budget for the President's new technologyinvestment. As a result, station options above $7billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions inthe rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a spacestation option of $9 billion would require $2 billionin offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.Gibbons presented the information at an organizationalsession of the advisory committee. Generally, themembers-designate focused upon administrative topicsand used the session to get acquainted. They alsoreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientationon the process the Station Redesign Team is followingto develop options for the advisory committee toconsider.Gibbons also announced that the United States and itsinternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, andCanadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give"full consideration" to use of Russian assets in thecourse of the space station redesign process.To that end, the Russians will be asked to participatein the redesign effort on an as-needed consultingbasis, so that the redesign team can make use of theirexpertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and thepossible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities andsystems. The U.S. and international partners hope tobenefit from the expertise of the Russian participantsin assessing Russian systems and technology. Theoverall goal of the redesign effort is to developoptions for reducing station costs while preserving keyresearch and exploration capabilities. Carefulintegration of Russian assets could be a key factor inachieving that goal.Gibbons reiterated that, "President Clinton iscommitted to the redesigned space station and to makingevery effort to preserve the science, the technologyand the jobs that the space station program represents.However, he also is committed to a space station thatis well managed and one that does not consume thenational resources which should be used to invest inthe future of this industry and this nation."NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said the Russianparticipation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science Center at the University of Marylandunder the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.

 38From the article "What's New" Apr-16-93 in sci.physics.research:........WHAT'S NEW (in my opinion), Friday, 16 April 1993  Washington, DC1. SPACE BILLBOARDS! IS THIS ONE THE "SPINOFFS" WE WERE PROMISED?In 1950, science fiction writer Robert Heinlein published "TheMan Who Sold the Moon," which involved a dispute over the sale ofrights to the Moon for use as billboard. NASA has taken the firsteps toward this hideous vision of the future.  Observers werestartled this spring when a NASA launch vehicle arrived at thepad with "SCHWARZENEGGER" painted in huge block letters on theside of the booster rockets.  Space Marketing Inc. had arrangedfor the ad to promote Arnold's latest movie. Now, Space Marketingis working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers ona plan to place a mile-long inflatable billboard in low-earthorbit.  NASA would provide contractual launch services. However,since NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates(WN 26 Mar 93) the taxpayers would bear most of the expense. Thismay look like environmental vandalism, but Mike Lawson, CEO ofSpace Marketing, told us yesterday that the real purpose of theproject is to help the environment! The platform will carry ozonemonitors he explained--advertising is just to help defray costs...........What do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalizethe night sky? It is not even April 1 anymore.What about light pollution in observations? (I read somewhere else thatit might even be visible during the day, leave alone at night).Is NASA really supporting this junk?Are protesting groups being organized in the States?Really, really depressed.

Have no statistical   basis for estimating how large software will be, how long it will   take to produce, how expensive it will be, or how reliable it will   be.  Most software production is at this level.2. stable process with statistical controls, rigorous project   management; having done something once, can do it again. Projects   are planned in detail, and there is software configuration   management and quality assurance.3. The process is defined and understood, implementation is   consistent. This includes things like software inspection, a   rigorous software testing framework, more configuration management,   and typically a `software engineering process group' within the   project.4. Statistical information on the software is systematically gathered   and analysed, and the process is controlled on the basis of this   information. Software quality is measured and has goals.5. Defects are prevented, the process is automated, software contracts   are effective and certified.Nick Haines nickh@cmu.edu

The other xthree instruments are focusing instruments, that, more or less, forman image, so positional errors are limited by craft attitude and the resolving power of the optics.  BATSE is an altogether differentbeast, effectively just 8 coincidence counters, one on each corner of the craft.  Positional information is triangulated from the differential signal arrival times at each of the detectors.Positional error would be predominantly determined by timing errorsand errors in craft attitude. Since none of the 8 BASTE detectors haveany independant angular resolution whatsoever, they can not be used todetermine parallax.  Indeed, parallax would just add a very small component to the positional error.  Demonstrating that these puppies are beyond the oort cloud would require resolution on the order of arcseconds, since the oort cloud is postulated to extend to about 0.5 parsec (all together now: "Parallax ARc SECond", a parsec is the distance of an object that demonstrates one arc second of parallax with a 2 AU base line).If the 3 degree accuracy reported above is true, we're going to have to add a BASTE to the pluto fast flyby to get enough baseline.The beauty of BASTE is that it both gives positional information andwatches the entire sky simultaneously, a realy handy combinationwhen you have no idea where the next burst is coming from.-Kevin

 33On Sat, 1 May 1993 23:13:39 GMT, henry@zoo.toronto.edu (Henry Spencer) said:> No.  A "dragless" satellite does not magically have no drag; it burns fuel> constantly to fight drag, maintaining the exact orbit it would have *if*> there was no drag.       Well, almost. It turns out that clever orbital mechanics can engineer things so that resonant interactions with the higher order harmonics of the Earth's gravitational field can pump energy into a satellite, and keep it from experiencing drag effects for periods of months to years.      My favorite example of this is the Soviet/Russian heavy ELINT satellites of the Cosmos 1603 class, which are in 14:1 resonance. In particular, C1833 has undergone two periods of prolonged *gain* in altitude, the current one having started in June 1991; the mean altitude of the satellite is now as high as it has ever been since launch on 18 March 1987. (Looking at the elements for C1833 also shows the limitations of NORAD's software -- but that's another story.)     This probably has little relevance to space stations, since the 71 degree orbits of the C1603 satellites are at 850 km, which is unacceptably far into the inner van Allen belt for manned platforms. But it's kind of interesting from the point of view of the physics of the situation.     (Orbital elements for these satellites are available on request.)

The    publication was enormously successful: we distributed 2000 copies to    space enthusiasts across the country and even sent a few to people in    Great Britain, Australia, and Ecuador. Due to the tremendous response to    the first edition, PPS has published an expanded, up-to-date second    edition of the guide.    The 40-page publication boasts 69 listings for summer and full-time job    opportunities as well as graduate school programs. The second edition of    "Space Jobs" features strategies for entering the space field and    describes positions at consulting and engineering firms, NASA, and    non-profit organizations. The expanded special section on graduate    schools highlights a myriad of programs ranging from space manufacturing    to space policy. Additional sections include tips on becoming an    astronaut and listings of NASA Space Grant Fellowships and Consortia, as    well as NASA Centers for the Commercial Development of Space.

Bussard, Journal ofPropulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990    Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion    systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the    thrust-power "gain" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, "high-thrust"    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local    gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer    "high-thrust" flight capability. One performance example shows a    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with    19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows    the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in    Earth/moon space."The QED Engine System: Direct Electric Fusion-Powered Systems forAerospace Flight Propulsion" by Robert W. Bussard, EMC2-1190-03,available from Energy/Matter Conversion Corp., 9100 A. CenterStreet, Manassas, VA 22110.    [This is an introduction to the application of Bussard's version    of the Farnsworth/Hirsch electrostatic confinement fusion    technology to propulsion. 1500<Isp<5000 sec. Farnsworth/Hirsch    demonstrated a 10**10 neutron flux with their device back in    1969 but it was dropped when panic ensued over the surprising    stability of the Soviet Tokamak. Hirsch, responsible for the    panic, has recently recanted and is back working on QED. -- Jim    Bowery]"PLASMAKtm Star Power for Energy Intensive Space Applications", byPaul M. Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of FusionEnergy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and    other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm    innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure    efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power    conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the    multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages    indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I    strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob    Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently    declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one    of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather    than Tokamak. Aside from the preceeding appeal to authority, the    PLASMAKtm looks like it finally models ball-lightning with solid    MHD physics. -- Jim Bowery]    ION DRIVES:Retrieve files pub/SPACE/SPACELINK/6.5.2.* from the Ames SPACEarchive; these deal with many aspects of ion drives and describe theSERT I and II missions, which flight-tested cesium ion thrusters inthe 1960s and 70s.

Therewas little involvement of federal funds, or except through support ofstate universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII.The US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding wasmainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not thatmany research universities, but they all provided their researchers withlow teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds fortravel to scientific meetings.  Not that much, but it was provided, and auniversity wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as wellas salary.During WWII, the military and the defense departments found that purescientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they were not exactly in the areas of the scientists' expertise.  This isprobably because of the "research mind" approach, which is not to tryto find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solutionemerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used todiscussion about their problems, the job got done.The military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for thefuture, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress wasunwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into thefuture supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as NSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedlykeep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations,making it more difficult for them to act to support research.The worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in whichthe government supports research the university will not provide funding,and in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose,as has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance ofa graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I askfor one?  The answer I will get is, "Get the money from NSF."  Now themoney at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level itcomes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member fromgetting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projectsget supported, and how much.  Also, the government decided that the "wealth" should be spread.  So insteadof having a moderate number of universities which were primarily researchinstitutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came intobeing.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluatingreseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposalhas to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator concealsalready done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I amproposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find impossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.  In addition, tomorrowI may get unexpected research results.  Possibly I may bet a bright ideawhich solves yesterday's too difficult problem, or a whole new approach tosomething I had not considered can develop.  This is the nature of the beast, and except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, itis not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring more than minimal attention of a good researcher.  I believe that at this time less quality research is being done than wouldhave happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the governmentis trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders.-- Herman Rubin, Dept. of Statistics, Purdue Univ., West Lafayette IN47907-1399Phone: (317)494-6054hrubin@snap.stat.purdue.edu (Internet, bitnet)  {purdue,pur-ee}!snap.stat!hrubin(UUCP)
