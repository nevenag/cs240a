At that village, whose name was publicizedthroughout the world, both sides suffered heavy casualties. We hadfour killed and nearly forty wounded. The number of casualties wasnearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers. The Arabtroops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy. The fightingwas thus very severe. Yet the hostile propaganda, disseminatedthroughout the world, deliberately ignored the fact that the civilianpopulation of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before thebattle began. One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationedat the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women,children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on theslopes of the hill.  By giving this humane warning our fighters threwaway the element of complete surprise, and thus increased their ownrisk in the ensuing battle. A substantial number of the inhabitantsobeyed the warning and they were unhurt. A few did not leave theirstone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. The fire of the enemywas murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquenttestimony. Our men were compelled to fight for every house; toovercome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. And thecivilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitablecasualties.    "The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years ofrevolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. Wenever broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, inaccordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. I amconvinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a singleunnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle. But those who throwstones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin [1] would dowell not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2].    "In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agencyfound it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah, whom Mr.Ben Gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called 'the wiseruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.' The 'wiseruler,' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung thebodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudalsuperciliousness. He rejected the apology and replied that the Jewswere all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of'dissidents.' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a waveof lying propaganda was let loose about 'Jewish attrocities.'    "The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. In theresult it helped us. Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel.Kolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of theHaganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting.Beit-Iksa was also evacuated. These two places overlooked the mainroad; and their fall, together with the capture of Kastel by theHaganah, made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem. In therest of the country, too, the Arabs began to flee in terror, evenbefore they clashed with Jewish forces. Not what happened at DirYassin, but what was invented about Dir Yassin, helped to carve theway to our decisive victories on the battlefield. The legend of DirYassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and theconquest of Haifa."[1] (A footnote from _The Revolt_, pp.226-7.) "To counteract the lossof Dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, Arab headquarters atRamallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre byIrgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewishofficials, fearing the Irgun men as political rivals, seized upon thisArab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was inducedto reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth. Out ofevil, however, good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend ofterror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were seized with panic atthe mention of Irgun soldiers. The legend was worth half a dozenbattalions to the forces of Israel. The `Dir Yassin Massacre' lieis still propagated by Jew-haters all over the world."[2] In reference to denunciation of Dir Yassin by fellow Jews.

Here is another one: Source: "Mitteilungsblatt, Berlin, December 1939, Nr. 2 and 5-6" Yet another historical fact: a fact that for years has been deliberately  forgotten, concealed, and wiped from memory - the fact of Armenian-Nazi  collaboration. A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. The  magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the magazine, which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation, is attention-getting. This magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind.  In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. They  occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices. The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered  "Aryan" and what befell them.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists                             a single Turkish soul.' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)

This includes, amongother things, the right to shoot or bomb *anyone* a national of the coun-try in question who is fighting them (which permits mass frontal assaulton all rock-throwers), along with the right to take out any installationof military importance (certain villages with too-good fortifications canbe handled by aerial bombing, as can waterways since they count as supplylines to the enemy), and the right to do anything whatsoever to whateverconstitutes a government that they can lay hands on (if Hamas is tryingto set up as the ruling party, let them beware). If this is not the scenario you want, I recommend you go back to callingit a civil war. Civil wars have to be handled nicer. You cannot say thePalestinians are a nation fighting a resistance war against a foreignnation and still call Israel a government who is treating its own peoplecruelly.

 105Today marks the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of2.5 million Turks and Kurds in Eastern Anatolia and x-SovietArmenia. The following letter, which represents a small portion of the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical documents, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs, was sent to President Bill Clinton, members of Congress, editors, program directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and radio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people. On April 23 of every year, the people of Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the lost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their lives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations may live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and prosperously.------------------------- letter ----------------------------------During the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day, Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland, which is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocidein order to shift international public opinion away from its politicalresponsibility.2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish Genocide.3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism throughthe ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-SovietArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence throughterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supportersof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community frommaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorialdemands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish peoplewill unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victimsof the Turkish Genocide demand:1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian Dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish andKurdish people;3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officiallyrecognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuseto succumb to all Armenian political pressure;5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of 2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in theefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new generation has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politicallymature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, throughall necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the armed struggle. Therefore, the victims of the Turkish Genocide call uponall Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in the political, cultural and religious activities of the 78th Anniversaryof the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

This is how the history between the two nations started some centuries ago.  Since then, it has been a continuous battle between the two nations.  From my perspective I can't see why I should say that Greeks have been responsible for what has happened  between the two nations.  Of course, it would not be reasonable to argue that the hostility should drag till we kick the Turks out of this area.  This isn't going to happen, so the best would be to improve the relations between the two countries.  A golden oportunity exists with Cyprus.

 11It is very encouraging that a number of people took so interest in my posting.I recieved a couple of letters too,some has debated the statement that events in Bosnia are unprecedented in the history of the modern world.Those who contest this statement present the figures of the World War II.However we must keep in mind that it was a World War and no country had the POWER to stop it,today is the matter not of the POWER but of the WILL.Itseems to be that what we lack is the will.Second point of difference (which makes it different from the holocast(sp?) ) is that at that time international communitydidnot have enough muscle to prevent the unfortunate event,today inspite of all the might,the international community is not just standing neutral but has placed an arms embargo whichis to the obvious disadvantage of the weeker side and therefore to the advantage of the bully.Hence indirecltly and possiblyunintentionally, mankind has sided with the killers.And this,I think is unprecedented in the history of the modern world.M.Rizvi

"When it comes to prisoners, old people                  and children, there were differences                  of opinion, but the majority was for                  liquidation of all the men in the village                  and any other force that opposed us,                  whether it be old people, women or children                  Benzion Cohen                  Commander of the attack on Deir Yassin,                  (J.A.T.)Let me put in some words here                a. premeditated                b. murderWhat do you say about the eyewitness testimony of the man in command?

In one place                  about eighty Arab prisoners were killed                  after some of them had opened fire and                  killed one of the people who came to give                  them first aid. Arabs who dressed up                  as Arab women were also found, and so                  they started to shoot the women also who                  did not hurry to the area where the                  prisoners were concentrated"                  (J.A.T.)Shooting prisoners, the wounded, as a warning to hurry? Sounds VERYfamiliar to me, how about you? Heard of other people other places doingthese things?                 "In one case - the Zahran family - only                  one out of twenty five survived. In                  another house they caught the sixteen                  year old son Fuad. His mother was holding                  him. They killed him with a knife. The                  mother spent twenty years after that in                  a mental hospital. A young woman and her                  two year old baby were shot in the                  street. Their bodies were left there.                  They moved to the centre of the village                  and started to kill everybody they saw or                  heard, as soon as anybody opened his                  door. They were using bombs [grenades],                  machine-guns, submachine-guns. My cousin                  escaped with bullet-holes in his clothes.                  One of the officers put his machinegun                  through a window and started shooting                  outwards, killing everybody who moved.                  They killed my uncle, Ali Hassan Zeidan,                  and my aunt Fatima. She heard him call                  'help me'. She ran to him and they killed                  her. Another neighbour Haj Yarah,                  heard some voices and came out. They killed                  him too. His son Muhammad, who was                  about seventeen, heard his father call                  him and went to the same place. They                  killed him. His mother heard her son cry                  for help. She ran out and they killed                  her. That was near my house.

Goodfor business, don't you know.  And BTW, not "everyone" wants to help theside that is less like us.I never said the two sides were morally equivalent, I said neither one isinnocent.There are just too many good reasons to stay away:1) The Europeans are perfectly able to deal with this dispute on their borders   in any way we do it.  Put another way, we have no assistance to offer the   Europeans which they do not already possess themselves.  It is not good to   promote the idea in anyone's mind that the United States is responsible   for cleaning up every bloody mess in the world.2) Clinton is not the man to lead this country into a military adventure.  Full   stop.3) It is by no means clear what intervention would accomplish, nor that it   would necessarily help the victims.  It is not clear what the goal is and   at what point any commitment could be ended.

Israelis top leaders in the past and present, always come acrossas arrogant with their tough talks trying to intimidate the Arabs.  The way I see it, Israelis and Arabs have not been able to achieve peaceafter almost 50 years of fighting because of the following two major reasons: 1) Arab governments are not really representative of their people, currently    most of their leaders are stupid, and/or not independent, and/or    dictators. 2) Israeli government is arrogant and none comprising.

You may ask : mistake ?Yes, I would say. Why is that the GREEKS DID NOT INVADE CYPRUS ?My response to the "shooting down" of a Turkish airplane over the Armenianair space was because of the IGNORANT posting of the person from your Country. Turks and Azeris consistantly WANT to drag ARMENIA into theKARABAKH conflict with Azerbaijan. The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have livedin their HOMELAND for 3000 years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are the ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION. Agression that has NO MERCY for INOCENT people that are costantly SHELLED with MIG-23's and othe Russian aircraft. At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER OCCUR again.

I don't mind us  helping out; but what invariably happens is that everybody expects  us to do most of the work and take most of the risks, even when these  events are occuring in other people's back yards, and they have the  resources to deal with them quite well, thank you.  I mean, it's   not like either Serbia, or Somalia represent some overwhelming  military force that their neighbors can't handle.  Nor are the   logistics a big deal -- it's a lot bigger logistical challenge   to get troops and supplies from New York to Somalia, than from   Saudi Arabia; harder to go from Texas to Serbia, than Turkey or   Austria to Serbia.---peter

Your comparison with the Warsaw Ghetto uprising is insulting,    and racist beyond belief.  The attempts to quiet any violence    in the Gaza Strip are just that.  The efforts to quell murder    and mayhem in the Gaza strip were the resluts of violence and    came AFTER the violence.  It was not an arbitrary racial move    like the nazi treatment of Jews.  Jews had NOT committed acts    of violence and murder as have the residents of Gaza.  I find     your eagerness to ignore the acts of murder nothing more than    anti-Israel bigotry.>The Gaza strip, this tiny area of land with the highest population>density in the world, has been cut off from the world for weeks.>The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of>Gaza, some 700.000 people, by denying them the right to leave the>strip and seek work in Israel.    It is NOT punishment, but protection from repeated attacks by    residents of Gaza.  You self-servingly omit any references to    WHY Israel has had to take action.  Apparaently the deaths of    innocent Israeli civilians do not enter into your equation, a    racist ommission on your part.>While Polish non-Jews risked their lives to save Jews from the>Ghetto, no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help>the Gazan resistance. The only help given to Gazans by Israeli>Jews, only dozens of people, is humanitarian assistance.>>The right of the Gazan population to resist occupation is>recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of>justice. A population denied basic human rights is entitled to>rise up against its tormentors.    The right of Israel to protect its citizens from murderers is    also recognized by international law.  Israeli civilians have    been getting stabbed to death on a daily basis.  If this wave    of murder does not matter to you, then your posturing for the    basic human rights you claim matter so much to you is nothing    but an anti-Israel charade.>As is known, the Israeli regime is considering Gazans unworthy of>Israeli citizenship and equal rights in Israel, although they are>considered worthy to do the dirty work in Israeli hotels, shops>and fields.     Do you know of residents of Gaza who have applied for Israeli    citizenship and were denied?  I have heard of no such denials    taking place.  Can you document this, or is this more of your    stupid and innacurate propaganda?  The truth is that if Gazan    residents applied for citizenship, HAMAS would murder them as    collaborators.     Many Gazans are born in towns and villages located in>Israel. They may not live there, for these areas are reserved for>the Master Race.    How dare you use such a disgusting phrase.  How very easy you    attack a people, when you omit facts which fly in the face of    your pure racism.  Perhaps you are judging a people to be the    racists that you are.  Do you believe that all Jews must have       the same bigoted makeup as you?          Here's another little fly in your ointment, about the 'master     race,' for you to avoid...    Two months ago a plane with 86 Bosnian Muslims left Bosnia to    seek asylum in the middle east.  Four Arab nations refused to    grant them asylum.  Then when Israli Arabs agreed to take the    responsibility for them, they were allowed into Israel.  Yes,    Israel.  But when the plane landed, the Israeli Arabs who had    previously agreed to take care of them refused to be involved    with the rescue project, because they felt that it would make    Israel look good.  It was more important to avoid any good PR    for Israel than to take care of fellow Muslims.  Israel moved    them to a kibbutz, where they are safe and secure.  The truth    is that time after time the Islamic world has turned its back    on Muslims in need more than Israel has.  Even in the case of    the 400 deportees, Lebanon was willing to let their so-called    Arab brothers freeze to death rather than give them sanctuary    in Lebanon.      Nearly twice as many Palestinians have been murdered by other    Palestinians than in confrontations with Israel.  Hundreds of    thousands of Palestinians had been deported from Kuwait, just    because they were Palestinian.  The truth is that your phoney    concern for the welfare of the Palestinians is nothing but an    excuse to attack Israel.  You are part of the ignorant effort    to confine all concern for the welfare of the Palestinians to    attacking Israel.  But the truth is there are greater reasons    than Israel for the plight of the Palestinians.  To disregard    Jordan or Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or any of the other oil-rich     nations who do nothing for these people, is to use the plight     of these poor people as a vehicle for your hatred of Jews, or    your hatred of Israel.  Anti-semitism and anti-Zionism is NOT    the same as pro-Palestinian and anyone who insists that it is    the same really does not give two hoots for their welfare.>The Nazi regime accorded to the residents of the Warsaw ghetto the>right to self- administration.  They selected Jews to pacify the>occupied population and preventing any form of resistance. Some>Jewish collaborators were killed. Israel also wishes to rule over>Gaza through Arab collaborators.    Your pathetic analogy is so absent of relevant fact that your    racism cannot be disguised.  Jews had never declared war on a    Polish people.  Jews had never attacked Poles with knives, or    had used the Ghetto as a staging ground for attacks.  To take    something like the Warsaw Ghetto(the creation of which you do    not even bother to discuss!)and the uprising that followed is    to degrade the dead, and to show that intelligent debate on a     difficult situation is beyond your intellectual purview.  You    clearly have never even read a single word of the Covenant of     the Islamic Resistance Movement.  Here is arguably the single    most anti-semitic genocidal document since Mein Kampf, yet it    is totally disregarded in your rantings.  Your racism is most    evident in your eagerness to avoid such documentation.  If it    were considered, you might actually have to deal with mideast    problems in a balanced manner, rather than in an anti-semitic    manner.>As Israel denies Gazans the only two options which are compatible>with basic human rights and international law, that of becoming>Israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for>self-determination, it must be concluded that the Israeli Jewish>society does not consider Gazans full human beings.     And just how was Gaza obtained?  Do you forget that Israel is    not in the habit of grabbing land for the hell of it, but had    taken Gaza in a war that it did not start?  Did you know land    Israel captures in wars, wars which other nations have ALWAYS    started, aren't the same as Israel, and they are subject to a     completely different set of international laws?  Since you do    continuously refer to international law, would you please say    what specific international laws Israel is violating?         This attitude>is consistent with the attitude of the Nazis towards Jews.     I can cite 6,000,000 reasons why it is not.>                                                             The>current policies by the Israeli government of cutting off Gaza are>consistent with the wish publicly expressed by Prime Mininister>Yitzhak Rabin that 'Gaza sink into the sea'.     Where is this quote?  I have never heard Rabin assert that he    wished such a thing.  Since you are in general a liar, you'll    have to provide the entire quote, with source, or this effort    will be regarded as just another one of your fabrications.>                                           One is led to ask>oneself whether Israeli leaders entertain still more sinister>goals towards the Gazans ? Whether they have some Final Solution>up their sleeve ?    Only you are led to ask such a loaded, racist, intellectually    dishonest question.  You inability to come to terms with what    you are has turned you into a racist of the highest order.>I urge all those who have slight human compassion to do whatever>they can to help the Gazans regain their full human, civil and>political rights, to which they are entitled as human beings.    Why do you not feel the same compassion for the Jews of Iran,    or Iraq, or Yemen, or Saudi Arabia, or Syria?  Do you have an    inkling of what they have endured over the past decades?  Or,    what about the plight of the Palestinians in Kuwait?  Or what    about the treatment of the Bosnian Muslims?  Do you think the    residents of Gaza are being subjected to what all the Muslims     in Bosnia are enduring?  Why are you indifferent to the death    and suffering of people?  Why do you not care that these folk    are being exterminated?  Why do you not care that only Israel    has given any of these people safe haven?  Could it be due to     the fact that it is not Israel who is doing the killing?  The    people in Gaza are not being exterminated.  They aren't being    killed.  They aren't being raped.  They aren't being starved.    They aren't being driven from their lands.  They are not kept    from receiving food or other supplies.  But the Bosnians are.    And the ONLY country which has provided some sanctuary to the    Bosnian Muslims is the same nation that you have devoted your     life to attacking, in the guise of compassion.        Your rantings are so unfettered by the burden of intellectual    honesty that you ought to take a deep breath and ask yourself    what your real motives are.  Do not flatter yourself into the    belief that truth or compassion are what drives you.  In your    case, it is clear that hate beats out love every time.  Maybe    you are burdened with some kind of guilt for having been born    a Jew.  It is obvious that your hatred of your own Judaism is    being dumped on all other Jews.  Why else would you suggest a    racist idea like breeding Jews out of existence?  Maybe these    fits of anti-semitism are a result of being cut off from your     own people for an extended period.  Whatever the case may be,     it is clear that you are not what you have labored so hard to     appear to be.  When you realize that you can't care for other     people while you hate yourself you might actually begin to do     some good.     But for now, you are a fruad.

But you've picked the wrong topic if you think a fewrigged "quotations" can sustain the legend and lie of the DeirYassin "massacre."You have a lot to learn when it comes to historical methodology.At the most basic level, you should know that there is a bigdifference between weighing evidence fairly and merely finding"quotations" that support your preset opinions.If you have studied the history of Israel at all you must know thatmany of the sources of your "quotations" have an axe to grind, andtherefore you must be very careful about whom you "quote."  Forexample, Meir Pa'il, whom you cite, was indeed a general, a scholar,and a war hero.  But that doesn't mean everything that comes out ofhis mouth is gold.  In fact (and here your lack of experienceshows), Pa'il is such a fanatic, embittered leftist that much of hisanti-Israel blathering (forget about anti-Irgun blathering) would beconsidered something like treason in non-Israel contexts.  But ofcourse you don't consider this AT ALL when you find a juicy"quotation" that you can use to attack Israel.Benny Morris (of Hashomer Hatzair) represents himself as a "scholar"when he rehashes the old attacks on the Irgun.  Don't be fooled.It's just the old Zionist ideological catfight, surfacing as anattack on the (then-) Likud government.  If you will look closely atthe section on Deir Yassin in his book on the War of Independence,you will see his "indictment" to be pure hot air.  And this is theBEST HE CAN DO after decades of digging for any sort of damningevidence.  Unfortunately for him, because his book parades itself as"scholarly," he is forced to put footnotes.  So you can clearly seethat his Deir Yassin account is based on nothing.The Deir Yassin "massacre" never took place as the propagandiststell it, any more than the Sabra and Shatila "massacres." Do you getthe feeling people like to blame the Jews for "massacres," even ifthey have to make them up?  It must sound spicy.  Even some Jewslike to do it, for reasons of their own.Please, don't confuse any of you Deir Yassin "massacre" stuffwith facts or scholarship.  You should stick to Begin's versionunless you find something serious to contradict it.Vic

In an  interview withthe Greek  newspaper "Ethnos" he said:  "I am a Greek  citizen ofTurkish origin. The individuals of the minority living in WesternTrace are also Turkish."Emphasizing  the education  problem for  the Turkish  minority inWestern  Thrace  Faikoglu said  that  according  to an  agreementsigned in 1951 Greece must distribute textbooks printed in Turkeyin Turkish minority schools in Western Thrace.Recalling his activities and those of Komotini independent MP Dr.SadIk  Ahmet  to  defend  the rights  of  the  Turkish  minority,Faikoglu said.  "In fact we  helped Greece. Because  we preventedGreece, the cradle of democracy, from losing face before Europeancountries by forcing the Greek  government to recognize our legalrights."On Turco-Greek relations, he pointed  out that both countries arepredestined  to live  in  peace for  geographical and  historicalreasons and said  that Turkey and Greece must  resist the foreignpowers  who  are  trying  to   create  a  rift  between  them  bycooperating, adding  that in  Turkey he  observed that  there waswill to improve relations with Greece.NEWSPOT, January 1993|3|MACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE.Two ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial inAthens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to aCourt Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS.  Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis)have been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments inan Athenian magazine.  Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weeklymagazine  "ENA"  on  March  11,  1992,  and  said  that  they  asMacedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and wouldfield  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greekgeneral election.  Bulev said in the interview: "I am not Greek, I am Macedonian."Sideropoulos said  in the  article that "Greece  should recogniseMacedonia.  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirationsagainst  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  theborder, at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EECare falling."  The  main  charge  against  the two,  according  to  the  courtsummons,  was   that  "they  have   spread...intentionally  falseinformation  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  thecitizens,  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  theinternational interests of the country (Greece)."  The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  aMacedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to1,000,000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece,  largelyconcentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek stateif anyone declares themselves Macedonian.  In  1913  Greece,   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partionedMacedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonianvillages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5million Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000in Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.  Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonianhuman rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker afew years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island inthe mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forcedthe Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town ofFlorina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where themajority of ethnic Macedonians live.  Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial inwhich  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent,especially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for itsnorthern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.  Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemnedGreece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (wholargely live in Western Thrace). But it remains to be seen if theUS government  will do anything until  the Presidential electionsare over.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

But did it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religionand national origin? By the way, you still haven't corrected yourself.During World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might andcringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publicationin Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1]"Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews) when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it  becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing." Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews -extracts from a letter dated December 11, 1983, published in the SanFrancisco Chronicle, as an answer to a letter that had been publishedin the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian. "...We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities  against our people (Jews)...Members of our family witnessed the   murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum, Turkey, by Armenian   neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish   and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see   the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors...  Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise   to grant them self government if, in return, the Armenians would   help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of  the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists. Mr. Amarian!  I don't need your bias."    Signed Elihu Ben Levi, Vacaville, California.[1] James G.

It is stressed in appeal that the experience of five-years of fightingfor independence from imperial chains shows a grim process . The waragainst Azerbaijan under the pretence of protecting the human rights of the Armenians of Ukhari (Upper) Garabag, has meant the destruction ofAzeri villages and towns, occupation of 10 percent of the territory, 60thousand new refugees in addition to 500 thousand already in place.This is all the price of fighting for liberty from Russian imperial rule,is said in the document.    Azerbaijan's government appeals to all compatriots to make everyeffort to inform the people of the world about the truth in Azerbaijan,and to assistance in solving the problems facing the young state.   It is stressed in the appeal that there is urgent need for medicine,food, experienced doctors and financial help to settle refugees fromKelbajar, Fizuli and Lachin regions, and to render medical aid for the sick and the wounded men.--O--60 REFUGEES FROM KELBAJAR PERISHED IN THEIR ESCAPE LORRIES      BAKU (APRIL 5) TURAN: Today, during the evacuation from Kelbajarregion, 60 refugees on board two lorries were killed in the fire from theArmenian Tanks on the only road to leave Kelbajar.

Evacuation helicopterscould not land near these villages because of shelling from theArmenian side and existence of fog. Measures are undertaken to air-dropfood and medicine to the encircled people.   Several hundred people succeed within the last twenty-four hours toget out of the region of Kelbajar via mountain range. Refugees are settled in the neighboring regions of Azerbaijan and in Ganja. Authorities face serious problem with rendering refugees medical aid and food. The number of refugees from Kelbajar is over 40,000 people.Azerbaijan is not capable of handling a disaster of this magnitude.--0--ARMENIAN ARMY CONTINUES ATTACK ON FIZULI   BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: The region of Fizuli of Azerbaijan, situated outside of the territory of Daglig (Nagorno) Garabag, has beensubjected to heaviest attacks of Armenian army for the fourth day. About30 armored technique and more than 500 soldiers of the enemy are takingpart in the attack.   Armenian units broke the defence line of the azeri forces and occupiedthe ruling height from where the town is shelled from "Grad" installations,this morning. There is heavy destructions in the town and more than 20people are dead.

Arif Aliev informed that as a result of the ongoing tragedy broughton by the latest aggression of Armenia, the leadership of Azerbaijanintends to appeal to Azerbaijanis and all those who treasure human lifeall over the world for help.   Concerning the reaction of the international community to aggression of Armenia, Aliev said the department of state of the USA has expressedits anxiety to leadership of Armenia.

Detailed information on latest events in the region ofKelbajar of Azerbaijan will be given at the press-conference.--0--AZERBAIJANIS PICKET IN FRONT OF MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF RUSSIA   BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Azerbaijanis, living in Moscow, picketedin front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia.Picket was conducted as a token of protest against participation ofRussian units in capture of the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan byArmenians. About 100 people took part in the picket, organized byAzerbaijani society "Dayag".--0--PICKET OF SADVALERS IN MOSCOW   BAKU (5 APRIL) 30-40 members of "Sadval" society picketed beforethe building of permanent representation of Azerbaijan in Moscow.Picketers were demanding the return of Lezghins lands, as if annexedby Azerbaijan.   Ambassador of Azerbaijan in Moscow, Hikmet Haji-zade classifiedthis action as provocation aimed at creating a further inter-ethnicconflict in Azerbaijan. He marked in his talk with the Turancorrespondent that he does not rule out a connection between theArmenian aggression in the region of Kelbajar and this anti-azerbaijani action of the "Sadval" society in Moscow. He alsomarked that 30-40 people do not mean the Lezghian nationality inthe whole.   Society of Lezghins, "Sadval", registered in Moscow in 1990,demands the creation of a Lezghistan state, which never existedbefore on the northern territories of Azerbaijan.--0--ATTACK OF ARMENIAN UNITS STOPPED   BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Attack of Armenian army on the town of Fizuli, which began in the last twenty-four hours, is stopped, informs the press-service of the Ministry of Defence of Azerbaijan.

Chairman of the parliament, Isa Gambar, visited the town of Fizuli and met with commanders of the units of the national armyand local citizens, today.--0--STATEMENT OF MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF AZERBAIJAN   BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan issued a statement in connection with aggression of Armenia in theregion of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan.   It is stated in the statement that regular units of the armedforces of Armenia captured the town of Kelbajar on April 3 .  Attack of Armenian units, which began on March 27 deep in theterritory of Azerbaijan still continues. Armenia has occupied atpresent 7500 sq.km of the territory of Azerbaijan.   Spreading of Armenian aggression far away from Ukhari (Upper)Garabag proves that the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflicts has entered aspecially dangerous phase. This is the result of non-recognition of Armenia as an aggressor by the international community, is markedin the document.   It is stressed in the statement that the units of the 7th Russianarmy are participating in the Armenian attack. This casts doubt onthe sincerity of Russian mediation efforts in finding a peacefulsolution to the conflict.   It is marked in conclusion that aggressive actions of Armenia have wrecked the negotiation process under aegis of CSCE.   The document contains the appeal to the world community to stopArmenian aggression and to use political and economic sanctionsagainst the aggressor.--0--Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

In fact, correct  me if I am wrong, Serbs are attacking Bosnians with their battle cries  "Death to the Turks!".   Is this so shocking? Years of communism apparently suppressed their   hatred and anger towards the Turks. But such hatred is obviously one that  dies hard.     Serbs must understand, Turks are no longer the good old barbarians world  has come to know by propaganda after propaganda.     Serbs must further understand that barbarism does not work.     Serbs must even further understand that barbarism would one day have  to face counter-barbarism. So, I urge those people [Serbs] to stop  killing Bosnian women and children.

 27Nntp-Posting-Host: watnxt04.ucr.eduWell everybody,After reading tons of notes by Serdar, I have come to the following conclusion.   Turkey is PERFECT, and no Turk has ever made a mistake.  He has proved to me at  least that the land occupied by Turkey today, was ALWAYS lived in peacefully by  Turks.  (Including Istanbul AKA Constantinople)  They treat their minorities  like gods and have only done good while all of their evil neighbors attacked  them.  Somehow, despite these evil neighbors capable of nothing but murder  their population has exploded to almost 60 million in Turkey alone. (Note,  Armenian worldwide population is approximately 7 million total)  I want to go  to this heaven on earth and meet the race that has made Serdar possible, that  has persevered, and has become a mecca for human rights lovers.  (Amnesty  International must have bad sources, Turkey would never torture its citizens,  treat minorities badly, or kidnap 7 foreign journalists last year alone, who  incidentally are still missing), what I am trying to say is I WANT TO BE A  TURK!!!!Now back to reality.  I have once again been astounded by Serdars ability to  ignore all truth, all truly difficult questions, and go on to his encyclopedia  of quotes and sources that can be pasted into any note BY THE PAGE!  Anybody at  all who has believed ANYTHING he has said, please step forward.  Let him know  he hasn't been wasting his time, that SOMEBODY out there can be convinced by  the volume of e-mail you can produce, not the quality of the content. Well I am  off now.  I will go dream  some more about that perfect place, that nirvana,  that utopia, that xanadu, that TURKEY!  n_w$$h

We ran into one of my relatives at the bus station and got to talking. A lot of people had gathered not far away,near the store. Well at first we didn't know what was happening, and then afellow I know comes up to me, an Azerbaijani guy, and says, "What are youstanding here for? Go home immediately!" I asked, "What's going on?" He says, "What's the matter, can't you see, they've overturned a car and they're killing Armenians!" He helped me catch a cab and we got home safely.We sat at home for two days. During that time a gang of bandits came into our courtyard. But the neighbors wouldn't let them in the building. There were about 80 of them. They had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands. Theywere shouting something, but you couldn't understand it. It wasn't one voice or two, all of them were shouting in a chorus. They turned toward Building 35.They went up to the third _floor, and we see that they're breaking glass and throwing things out the window. After a while they come out the entryway: one has a pair of jeans in his hands, another has a tape recorder, and a third a guitar. They went on toward the auto parts store.We had to save ourselves. After midnight on March 1 we went to hide at School No. 33, which is in Microdistrict 13. There were two other Armenian families there with us. There were 13 of us altogether. Out of all of them I had only known Ernest before, he had moved to Sumgait from Kirovabad. The Azerbaijani guard at the school let us in. At first he didn't want to, but there was nowhere else for us to go. We had to plead with him and talk him into it. We were told that on that day, the 1st, there would be an attack on our microdistrict.We went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor.On the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could beused to summon assistance or communicate anything important. I called one of them and the First Secretary of the Sumgait City Party Committee answered. Iasked him for assistance. I say, "We're in School No. 33, we need to be evacuated." Well he says, "Got it, wait there, I'm sending out help now."I know his voice. The First Secretary had been to our plant, I had spoken withhim personally. When I called he said, "Muslimzade here."About two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school. We looked outthe window and about 100 to 120 people were outside saying, "Armenians, come out, we're here to get you." They have clubs, axes, and armature shafts in their hands. The guard sat there with us, and asked, "Where should I go?" I say, "If your life is of any value to you you'll go down there and say that the Armenians were here and that they left." That's what he did. He went down there and said, "The Armenians were here," he said, "I let them out the back door, they went that way." And pointed with his hand. And with shouts and noise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed.So the assistance we had been promised did come. They sent us help, all right!Instead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own. I am positive thatMuslimzade did that. No one had seen us entering the school, no one knew that we were there. In any case, we stayed at the school until seven in the morning, and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid.In the morning we went to my relative's in Microdistrict 1, and the soldiers took us to the SK club from there. The club was jammed with people, and there were lots of people ahead of us--there was no space available. One small boy, about three months old, died right in my arms. There wasn't a single doctor, nothing. The boy was uninjured, there were no wounds or bruises on him. He wasjust very ill. They gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, they did everythingthey could under the circumstances, but were unable to save him. And his mother and father, a young Armenian couple, were right there, on the floor ...I searched for a spot for us in the SK, we have a small child of our own, Iwanted to find a room or something to put my family in. I went up to the thirdfloor, there were a lot of soldiers up there, bandaged, with canes, limping, with their heads broken open. They were a terrible sight. Young guys, all of them.There were a lot of bandaged Armenians, too. Everyone had been beaten, everyone was crying, wailing, and calling for help. I think that the CityParty Committee ignored us completely. True, there was a snack bar: a sausage was 30 kopeks or 40 kopeks, a package of cookies that cost 26 kopeks was beingsold for 50, a bottled soft drink cost a ruble . . . But there was no way to get the things any cheaper.I met my old uncle, Aram Mikhailovich, there. He saw me and tears welled up inhis eyes. My whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples, that we worked together, he always had Azerbaijanis over at his house. And now he saw me and there was nothing he could say, he just cried. You can understand his feelings, of course.

Ivica Ceresnjes, president of the Jewish Community of Sarajevo, says heand about 1,000 other Jews chose to remain in Sarajevo, rather than leavefor Israel, to keep a feeding center in the medieval old town districtrunning. Ceresnjes said that was partly in gratitude to the Muslims who hid Jews duringthe Nazi occupation and partly to keep intact the centuries-old presence of Jews living in Sarajevo. ``Some with guns are defending Bosnia, but I fight in Bosnia by keeping people alive,'' Ceresnjes said. As a student of Balkan history, Ceresnjes said he saw this war coming and had ready plans to evacuate children and the elderly. A year before the warerupted here last April, Ceresnjes said the Jewish center beganstockpiling supplies, ensuring everyone had passports and arranging forplaces in Israel and Europe for the evacuees. They were so well prepared, he said, that only five days after theshooting began the first plane left. Of about 2,000 Jews in Bosnia-Herzegovina, he estimates half have left. Many of those who stayed behindwork in Sarajevo's downtown synagogue, which has been turned into awartime feeding center that has so far given away 380,000 meals. The center, which has been shelled several times along with most ofSarajevo, also runs a radio station, mail center and distributes foodpackages sent by Jewish organizations around the world. While Muslims and Jews are fighting each other in the Mideast, Jews heresay there's a long tradition of cooperation, inter-marriage andtolerance between the two communities in Sarajevo that goes back tocenturies of Turkish occupation. Sarajevo's Jews trace their ancestry back to their expulsion from RomanCatholic Spain in 1492. The community numbered more than 14,000 beforeWorld War II. But only 10% survived the Holocaust -- which was carried outby the pro-Nazi Croatian Ustache in Yugoslavia. Many of the survivors werehidden by Muslim families in Mostar. -- Sharon Machlis GartenbergFramingham, MA  USAe-mail: sharon@world.std.com----------------------------------------Zafar.tippu hassan
 9Pete--That was uncalled for. I'm sure Andi Beyer or whatever his name iswas a product of his environment before he came to school, and isenjoying the mantle of THE UNIVERSITY to make his viewpoint seemlegitimate (well-reasoned). I'm at Virginia, too, and I think maligning UVA is in poor taste, even if Beyer did slip in here.Jesse

Chaihorsky) wrote:[A] David --[A] We can go throwing flames at each other -[A] nothing is easier. Why do not you just try to[A] see the situation from a different prospective?Not taking sides leaves one in a state of perpetual indecision because both sides in this issue have their own logic at any given time. As an Armenian I am partisan -- by definition. However, this does give me the license to lie, cover-up, or revise events under question as we have read on UseNet in postings by agents of the Turkish government. I understand both sides of the issue, but this does not mean I will advocate both sides when it suits me. Such a position would make me a hypocrite. I am also not being paid by agents of Turkey nor Azerbaijan as are many proponents of the Azeri side. I refer to agents such as Captioline International Group, Ltd., being paid in excess of $30,000/month by Azerbaijan. I state my case unencumbered by such advocacy or prostitution. [A] You do not have to change your mind for that - [A] just (as if you are playing chess) ask yourself -[A] what if? [A] What if your tone is so offensive that one type of[A] people loose control and start to erratically insult[A] you, and others emotionally detach themselves from[A] you writings and are not engaging in the discussion [A] with you?My tone is not offensive. If people are offended by what I say than I justmay be too bad. This conflict, as is human conflict in general, is rather bleak and is surrounded by the most barbaric actions of man. Given such conditions, dispassion is rather difficult, and artificial at best. This does not mean that discussion is out of the question. No conflict is ever resolved without discussion.[A] I'll try first. Recently I received a message from[A] a Russian guy who frequently visited Baku that [A] approximately after 1986 the old situation when [A] there were no anti-Armenian press had changed and[A] the press became very anti-Armenian and average[A] Azeri became an Armenian-hater. This is devastation [A] news for me because one of my cornerstones was the fact[A] that I MYSELF SAW ARMENIANS IN BAKU AMONG OTHER ETHNIC[A] GROUPS AND SAW, OR HEARD, OR READ NOTHING THAT WOULD[A] SEEM LIKE HATRED. You might say that an outsider never [A] sees, but by that time I was myself victimized as a member[A] of a minority by Russians and knew what to look for and[A] what innocent sign or remark might signify.I am sure. The Soviet Union effectively froze in time all ethnic problems itcreated or was brewing just after WWI. During the Soviet reign, officials tended to shape the frozen conflicts in such a way so when thawed, they would serve the purposes of the internal policies of the Soviet Union orsuccessor states.[A] Again - one of my cornerstones show cracks. I will investigate.[A] Another cornerstone of my thought is that Armenia started[A] hostilities against Azeris in Armenia before anything happened[A] in Sumgait (not at all I am trying to justify violence in Sumgait[A] or anywhere else - I bow my head with grief and respect and [A] did demand and will laways demand that criminals be severely[A] punished according to the law of the land.[A] I would like you to supply me with the information about that.[A] Does or does not the hostilities began in Armenia? Was thousands[A] od Azeris thrown out of their homes and forced to leave Armeina[A] before Sumgait or not? Sumgait took place in February of 1988. The Azeris of Armenia were expelledin the late fall of 1988. It took the entire summer of 1988 for thesituation to get so bad for Azeris in Armenian that the Russians had toevacuate them. I refer specifically to _Human Rights Violations in Armeniaand Azerbaijan_, A report of Pax Christi Netherlands 12 September 1991. Also,one need only read the newspaper to verify this. You do realize, perhaps unknowingly -- perhaps not -- you are mirroring Turkish propaganda and lies regarding what took place when and where first![A] Second - in your last message you used a very terrifying[A] phrase - "Artificial borders" when you were talking about [A] Armenian. Do you believe that Armenia have righteous territorial[A] claims? Do you believe that Armenia has rights to the lands that[A] currently belong to other countries? [A] Do you believe that this is stricktly Armenian priviledge or[A] everybody should start reclaiming what once was theirs?I had addressed this issue several time before -- perhaps I was not clear. Thecurrent borders of Armenia were not set as a result of the consolidation ofa high Armenian culture. Today's Armenia is about 1/10 the land mass thatsustained Armenians for nearly three millennia. It was the natural Armenianboundaries that sustained Armenians -- not the current boundaries. The currentborders of Armenia would never support a society nor sustain its growth. Does this mean that Armenia should expand? It might, if Armenia is not allowed to integrate into the region. If this past winter is any indication of the future status of Armenia, then Armenia must do what it will to survive. Unfortunately, in my opinion, and you can quote me on this, as I am sure you and others will, the combined forces of both Armenia and Karabakh should have taken Karabakh and the land in between in a matter of weeks in late 1991. This would avoided all the pain and suffering both sides endured and would remove a tool of Russian influence in the Caucasus. You may call me a war-monger -- so be it. If Armenians don't defend their right to live on the land they live on, those rights will be taken away. The Azeris should not have the right to remove these Armenians, but given the first chance to, they will, as was proven throughout all of Azerbaijan. If the Soviet Union didn't break apart, today Karabakh would be emptied of Armenians. Operation Ring, started in early 1991 emptied the northern 1/3 of Karabakh of Armenians, but the operation was suspended by the disillusionment of the Soviet Union. Lucky for the Armenians! If the Azeris feel as though they can expel all the Armenians of Karabakh, the Armenians will resist, if the Armenians can't live under Azeri oppression, then they will fight for the right to live their lives free from such oppression. If this means these Armenian demand independence, I support such a move. If you can't understand this, as an Azeri, that is truly unfortunate. Until this is understood by the Gray Wolves in Baku, more young Azeri men will die in the pursuit of the expulsion and ethnic cleansing of Karabakh Armenians. [A] Third thing - you keep saying about 3000 years of Armenian presence[A] in Karabakh. What exactly you mean by that? That there were Armenians[A] 3000 years ago in Karabah? Only Armenians? Or among other nations?[A] I saw (SAW) a Russian tax map of Karabah with all the landowners and[A] occupant names on it (the map was surveyed by Russian Army in 1810.[A] Would you believe that there were almost exclusivly Achmeds and Hu-[A] sseins? I also saw Armenian names, but the absolute majority of the[A] population was Muslim. If I am wrong - give me your sources, but[A] please, let us keep the rule that we only pay attention to third[A] party sources.[A] There are Russian diplomatic documents about the mission of the[A] Russian famous writer and diplomat Griboedov whose mission in Iran[A] was protection of Armenians that were persecuted by Persians and[A] RELOCATION these Armenians inside Russian Empire. According to[A] the Russian tax documents that was the time when the population of[A] Karabakh became predominantly (in some places) Armenian.Karabakh, or Artsakh as it is known in Armenian (and Urartian) is the onlypiece of Armenia that has a continuous Armenian occupation, from thetransformation of the Urartians to Armenians, nearly 3,000 years ago. Yourefer to Russian and Muslim rulers over Karabakh, not the population! Yousurely must know the rules of Muslim landownership over non-Muslims.[A] You write in your letter that "Azeris were shelling Stepanakert which[A] now is almost completely destroyed"  David - is it fair to say that [A] Stepanakert was destroyed by Azeris? There is that fine line between[A] propaganda and personal view, however bizzarre that view is - YOU KNOW[A] AS WELL AS ANYBODY WHO SAW TV IN THE TIMES OF THE EARTHQUAKE - that [A] Stepanakert was almost completely devastated by the quake. [A] But may be you believe that the damage from Azeri shelling is greater[A] than the damage from the quake? OK, no problem, AS LONG AS YOU MENTION[A] THE QUAKE. As I wrote in a short response to you regarding this earlier. You may beconfusing Spitak with Stepanakert. There were no effects of the earthquake in Karabakh.[A] I want dialog. I am not interested in mud-throwing. And in dialog I want[A] honest opinions (one might be wrong, but one MUST be honest). Honest [A] opinions may be based on emotions but in this case one should indicate[A] that. But mostly we are looking for information based opinions.[A] I always ask myself - why I think that? Is it because I was told so[A] bt so many people that it became a truth? Or I read a book? Who wrote[A] it? What was his/her intentions/interests/whatever? Fine. I stated my opinions and the reasons for them. If you put into action what you just stated above, you would understand my outrage at the posting of Farid who just posted items from some Islamic conference, etc., and just left it at that. He has done his numerous times. At least I responded to that posting, and was outraged that Farid simply copies other people`s text, posts it -- yet does not display the courage be responsible for what he posts. One can always stand behind the facade of claiming what I write is polemic, however, as a result such irresponsibility I am free to make a claim of cowardice. [A] Please, give me sources, facts, titles of the books of third party[A] writers, etc.I believe I have, and can support what I claim. I don't make up history, nordo I have to! I have done enough research regarding Turkish Genocide Apology to revisionism from good scholarship, and I will never fall victim to bottomless pit of making claims without a solid basis.[A] And please, answer my questions in the beginning of the letter.[A] And for you Armenian friends who do not like what I write - [A] sorry, but these are my thoughts and it is very disturbing[A] that you like people when they say what you like and dislike[A] them when they say something that you do not like. Alex, I stated my friends and associates where rather surprised as the tone ofyour posting considering the fact that I had categorized you as an open-minded Azeri. Perhaps I was fooled by you? Perhaps I should believe that you are like "all Azeris when it comes to Armenians". I chose not to accept such a statement. They were not surprised at what you said so much as it was coming from you, somebody from which they expected otherwise. You see, you didn't add anything to the issue, which was the expectation, only conforming oldsuspicions.[A] For me[A] it is most inportant that a guy makes a honest effort to find[A] the truth. If so, he/she might have whatever opinion he/she[A] wants. I believe that telling people the truth, seeking it - is [A] far more noble than just support your race because it is yours.[A] That is a way of animals, primitive tribes and criminal societies.[A] Civilized people seek truth.[A] Cheers,[A] AlexIf you think I am intellectually dishonest, please demonstrate it. As I statedabove, I am partisan on this issue, thus expect me to take a stand in theinterest of the Armenians, not against Armenians. This stance should not seem strange to you. I am not here to generate excuses for Armenians wanting to live on the land they live on, and wanting to live in peace. If Armenians must die for what they believe in, and make ultimate sacrifice, you had better listen to them. No amount of rhetoric -- not from Yerevan, Baku, the CSCE, nor paid prostitutes in Washington -- will convince Karabakh Armenians otherwise! -- David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | "Armenia has not learned a lesson inS.D.P.A.

No Muslim left alive - not a single one. Leading the first Armenian units who crossed the Ottoman border in the company of the Russian invaders was the former Ottoman Parliamentary representative for Erzurum, Karekin Pastirmaciyan, who assumed the revolutionary name Armen Garo. Another former Ottoman parliamentarian, Hamparsum Boyaciyan, led the Armenian guerrilla forces who ravaged Turkish villages behind the lines under the nickname "Murad", especially ordering that          'Kill Turks and Kurds wherever you find them and in           whatever circumstances you find them. Turkish children           also should be killed as they form a danger to the           Armenian nation.' (Hamparsum Boyadjian - 1914)[1] [1] M. Varandian, "History of the Dashnaktsutiun," p. 85.Another former Member of Parliament, Papazyan, led the Armenian guerrilla forces that ravaged the areas of Van, Bitlis and Mush.In March 1915, the Russian forces began to move toward Van. Immediately,in April 11, 1915 the Armenians of Van began a revolt, massacring all the Turks in the vicinity so as to make possible its quick and easy conquest by Russians. Little wonder that Czar Nicholas II sent a telegram of thanks to the Armenian Revolutionary Committee of Van in April 21, 1915, "thanking it for its services to Russia." The Armenian newspaper Gochnak, published in the United States, also proudly reported in May 24, 1915 that "only 1,500 Turks remained in Van the rest having been slaughtered."Source: Hovannisian, Richard G.: Armenia on the Road to Independence, 1918.University of California Press (Berkeley and Los Angeles), 1967, p. 13."The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem. Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the  Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897, however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character  notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian  Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the  southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia."  (See also Map 1. Historic Armenia and Map 4. Administrative subdivisions of  Transcaucasia).In 1920, '0' percent Turk. "We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as  ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work  of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village.  Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts  into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable  and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets  completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They  found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border  into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole  length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to  Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain  plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of  Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for  howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the  scattered bones of the dead."

Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common soldiers began deserting in droves.""With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy increased drastically.

The main legal principles of the Turkish State are summarized in Article 2 of the Constitution:"The Republic of Turkey is a democratic, secular and social Stategoverned by the rule of law; bearing in mind the concepts of publicpeace, national solidarity and justice; respecting human rights;loyal to the nationalism of Ataturk, and based on the fundamentaltenets set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution."Freedom of culture and religion prevailed during the Ottoman Empire, allowingthe many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous. Thefact that the Ottoman Empire was the longest lived in recent history may beattributed to these freedoms, despite the lack of any written Constitution.The first attempts to create a written Constitution occurred in 1839 and 1856.Although the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in forceonly temporarily, they provided the basic elements of a Constitution.The 1876 Constitution was the first legal document to force a Parliament andthe right of election to share the sovereignty of the Emperor. The Constitutionof 1906 placed some additional limitations on the Emperor, while increasingthe power of the Parliament and the government.The First World War (1914-1918) brought the Ottoman Empire to an end. By theoccupation of Istanbul, the Parliament was dissolved and the Constitution wasabolished. The members of Parliament were sent to exile to an island by theoccupying forces.During the Independence War, the "Turkish Grand National Assembly" held theirfirst meeting on April 23, 1920 to serve as the legislative body of the newTurkish state. This assembly prepared the new legal structure of the TurkishRepublic. The new Republic was proclaimed on October 29, 1923 and the newConstitution was adopted in 1924. That Constitution served as the legal backbone of today's modern Turkish Republic. In 1945, Turkey adopted a multi-party political system. The Constitution of 1924 was replaced byothers in 1961 and 1982. All three Constitutions of the Republic have beenbased on the principles of parliamentary democracy, human rights, nationalsovereignty, division of powers, private ownership and secularization."Major Principles of the Constitution"The constitution (with 177 Articles) establishes the structure of the Republicwithin the following principles:- The Turkish Republic is a democratic, secular and social state governed by   law;- It should be governed to maintain public peace, national solidarity, justice,  human rights and the objectives of Ataturk;- The language of the State is Turkish;- Sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions.  Sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation;- Legislative power is carried by the Parliament elected by the nation. This  power cannot be delegated (transferred) to any one else;- Executive power is exercised by the President, and Council of Ministers;- Judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the  Turkish nation;- All individuals are equal, irrespective of language, race, religion, color,  sex, or political beliefs;- Laws cannot be contradict those principles stated in the Constitution."Structure of the State"In accordance with the Constitution, the structure of the state is based on theprinciple of "division of power" to create a balanced and self-controlledsystem. The power is divided into "legislative power," "executive power," and"judicial power," balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control eachother (self-control). A. Legislative Power: The "Turkish Grand National Assembly" is a parliament with one House, elected by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on behalf of the nation. The basic functions of this Assembly are: - to adopt, to amend, or to repeal laws; - to approve or to dismiss the Council of Ministers; - to supervise and to question Ministers or the Council of Ministers; - to debate, to amend and to approve annual budgets; - to ratify international agreements; - to grant amnesty or pardons. Members of Parliament do not have any liability for their words (either oral or written) during the course of their legislative duties. The country is divided into constituencies. The number of representatives of each is calculated according to its population. Every Turkish citizen over the age of twenty-one can vote. Elections are supervised by the "Supreme Council of Elections," which solves all disputes or appeals. In each province, the local "Board of Election" runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the Supreme Council. Members of the Council and Boards are elected among  independent judges. B. Executive Power: The President of the Republic is the Head of State (not the head of government as in the Unites States). The main functions of the President are: - to represent the State and the Country; - to insure the implementation of the Constitution; - to coordinate legislative, judicial and executive functions; - act as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces; - to ratify laws and government decrees.  The President is elected by the Grand National Assembly for a period of seven years. The President may ratify or return the laws for a second debate, may  call for a referendum. Executive power is exercised by the "Council of Ministers," headed by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President from the members of Parliament. The Prime Minister names the Ministers for approval by the President. The new Government (Council of Ministers) reads their program at the Parliament and the vote of confidence follows. There are 21 (?) Ministers in the Council. Ministers and other members of the administration can be sued in independent "administrative" courts for their misuse of power, administrative errors or functions against any law. C. Judicial Power: Judicial power is exercised by independent courts. No authority or power can instruct the judges or public prosecutors of the courts. These cannot be  discharged, replaced or retired by executive authorities except for the reasons clearly stated by the appropriate laws. There are three categories of courts in the Turkish judiciary system: - Courts of justice deal with legal, commercial and criminal cases. The    decisions of these courts may be reviewed by the supreme court of justice   upon the appeal of the parties involved. - The decisions or functions of the executive power (including the Prime   Minister and Ministers or any governmental department) can be appealed in   administrative courts if these functions or decisions are against the law.   The decisions of these administrative courts may also be reviewed by the   high administrative court. The laws and decisions of the Grand National Assembly can be examined by the "Constitutional Court" if they contradict the Constitution. If found contradictory, this court may cancel the decisions or laws of the Parliament.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists                             a single Turkish soul.' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)

 85From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>Subject: Rabin and his Palestinians kaposRabin's plans for a Palestinian police(from The Other Front, Alternative Information Center,Jerusalem, 5 May 1993)"The decision to view the setting up of a local police force for (sic) the Palestinians as the central issue for deliberation at the peace talks to be resumed next week - even before subjects like elections in the territories and areas of juridiction in the framework of autonomy - is a sign of the Israeli government's serious attitude towards the peace process."The setting up of a police force is not part of the 'gesture package', but deals with the very heart and substance of the Palestinian struggle for national identity. As it turns out, the main objective guiding the prime minister in the setting up of a Palestinian police force - and apparently also supported by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres - is to ensure the holding of democratic elections in the territories."Thus writes Amnon Barzilai in his editorial (Israeli daily Hadashot, 23 April), and his position articulates the thinking of most of the commentators who dealt with this issue in the past two weeks. Over against them stand the settlers and rightwing parties, who also interpret the decision to encourage the establishment of a Palestinian police force as a significant step towards the instituting of real autonomy, something which will restrict what can be done by the Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. With a variety of demonstrations, including street theater on 'What will happen when there is a Palestinian police force', rightwing elements are attempting to frighten the Israeli public and to pressure Rabin to go back on his decision. Members of the Kach movement have even begun to organize a 'settler police force' in the Occupied Territories, as counter-balance to the future Palestinian police force.However, as Barzilai points out, the main function of the new police force - as far as the Israeli government is concerned - has nothing to do with the settlers, over whom they will apparently have no authority, but will control political groups within the Palestinian population, whom the government is interested in neutralizing. Writes Barzilai:"...According to ideas currently taking shape, the setting up of a local police force in the territories will precede, not only the stage of electsion, but also the final stages of the preparing of the interim autonomy agreement."The willingness of the Israeli government to set up a local Palestinian police force is evidence that the government is serious about arriving at a settlement with the Palestinians..."It's no wonder that the Palestinian public is also greatly worried about this new Israeli initiative. And it is inevitable that pressure will be brought to bear on Faisal Husseini and the rest of the delegation members, from a variety of directions, to refuse the gift which Rabin would like to give them. But at this stage, it looks like the Palestinians are cooperating in the fulfillment of his plans.----------------------------------------------------Add'l comment by E.D.:Numerous Palestinians fear that Israel might succeed in co-opting some Palestiniancircles by this idea. They fear that a Palestinian police force, controlled in fact by Israel, might act even more brutally than the IDF. The idea of using a surrogate police force is not new. It is used by Israel in Lebanon and was used by the Nazis to control Jewish ghetto-dwellers.

TORTURE." ---------- */FROM THE ISRAELI PRESS.Newspaper: Ma'ariv Date: 18. December 1992 Author: Avi RazSubject: TortureTitle of article: Moderate physical pressureSeveral times in the course of the long hours in the interrogationroom in Tulkarm prison, during which he says he was humiliated,beaten and tortured, Omar Daoud Jaber heard his interrogator, aShabak agent 'Captain Louis', chatting on the phone with his wife."At those moments", Omar said, "I felt that he was like ahumanbeing, but right after he finished talking, he would be beatme and say, 'You listened to the conversation and enjoyedyourself' and I understood that he was not really a human being".In late October 1992, after 38 days in detention at Tulkarmprison, Omar Jaber was released without charges. "Among the Jews,as among the Arabs, there are good people and bad people", he saidafter his release, "but there, in Tulkarm, in the interrogationsrooms, you cannot find even one person about whom you can say thathe is a human being". Although he left the detention installationin Tulkarm bruised and humiliated ("I sat at home for ten days. Myhands shook from nerves"), one may consider Omar Jaber lucky: Hegot out, not so healthy, but entire, and even ultimately returnedto normal functioning, at the small solar heater plant he owns.In contrast, Hassan Bader al-Zbeidi, for example, was releasedseven weeks ago from detention in Tulkarm after 33 days in theShabak wing, cut off from his surroundings. He doesn't speak orreact. Mustafa Barakat, aged only 23, who was arrested in earlyAugust and was brought to the Tulkarm detention installation, leftit one day later - dead. "We have recently received an especiallylarge number of testimonies concerning cruel tortures employed atthe Tulkarm detention installation by Shabak interrogators", notedDr. Niv Gordon, director of the Association of Israel andPalestinian Physicians for Human Rights. (...)The right to complain against the Shabak does not excite AnanSaber Makhlouf, a 20 year old student. In fact, he was extremelyfearful about describing the manner in which he was interrogatedin Tulkarm prison, in case the publication in the paper wouldreturn him to detention and lead to renewed mistreatment.(...follow description of tortures....)Omar, a tall bearded man, was silent. "I do not want to talk aboutit", he finally said, quietly. Some time later, embarrased andashamed, he spoke: "Sometimes he beats you and beats you untilyou'll kiss his hand, and not only his hand. Even the hands ofanother interrogator, and another, whom he calls into the room,and the last interrogator says:" Now you are kissing my hand, andlater if I want, you will kiss my ass."These things take place in an Israeli army detention installation,located within the military government compound in Tulkarm (WestBank). But the Shabak interrogation wing is a separate kingdom. Inearly March the IDF allowed representatives of B'Tselem, theIsraeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Territories, tovisit Tulkarm prison, but denied them access to the interrogationwing. "The interrogation wing is Shabak property, being solelyunder Shabak responsibility. All interrogations are performed byit", said Lieutnant Sharon Sho'an, the commander of theinstallation, according to the internal report written by B'tselemmember, Yuval Ginbar, following the visit. Major David Pe'er,governing commander of the prison system in the Central Command,was quoted in the report:  "There is an ethical problem here - noone can enter the interrogation wing".Transl. by I.

True, it may sometimes be difficult orStill living in an alternate universe? Numerous articles in major newspapers (London Times) and periodicals (Newsweek) during the war, had suggested the existence of a significant collaboration between Armenians and the Nazis. Arthur Derounian deserves credit for being the first person to deal with this issue extensively. Derounian's motives were twofold: his deeply held democratic convictions gave him a sense of duty and he felt obliged to shed light on this yet another dark chapter of Armenian history.Concurrently, Derounian embarked on what one would call 'crisis control' or face-saving. In order to forestall any potential attacks on the larger Armenian community in the United States, he marginalized collaboration as deplorable but insignificant.[1][1] John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), 'The Plotters,'    E. P. Dutton & Company, Inc., New York 1946, p. 182. Source: "Mitteilungsblatt, Berlin, December 1939, Nr. 2 and 5-6" Yet another historical fact: a fact that for years has been deliberately  forgotten, concealed, and wiped from memory - the fact of Armenian-Nazi  collaboration. A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. The  magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the magazine, which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation, is attention-getting. This magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind.  In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. They  occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices. The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered  "Aryan" and what befell them.Now wait, there is more.Source: "From Sardarapat to Sevres and Lausanne" by Avetis Aharonian. The Armenian Review, Vol. 16, No. 3-63, Autumn, Sep. 1963, pp. 47-57.p. 52 (second paragraph)."Your three chiefs, Dro, Hamazasp and Kulkhandanian are the ringleaders of the bands which have destroyed Tartar villages and have staged  massacres in Zangezour, Surmali, Etchmiadzin, and Zangibasar. This is intolerable. Look - and here he pointed to a file of official documents on the table - look at this, here in December are the reports of the last few months concerning ruined Tartar villages which my representative Wardrop has sent me. The official Tartar communique speaks of the destruction of 300 villages."p. 54 (fifth paragraph)."Yes, of course. I repeat, until this massacre of the Tartars is stopped and the three chiefs are not removed from your military leadership I hardly think we can supply you arms and ammunition.""...it is the armed bands led by Dro, Hamazasp and Kulkhandanian who during the past months have raided and destroyed many Tartar villages in the regions of Surmali, Etchmiadzin, Zangezour, and Zangibasar.

I said the phenomenon was race-related, which is not the same asracist.  Perhaps this distinction is too subtle for you to grasp) motives - Isaid the attention and outrage at the entire Yugoslavian situation was a resultof it being 1) closer to home, 2) happening to people we can identify with, and3) relentlessly harped on by the media.  I never said anything about which sidewould be preferred, which has a lot more to do with the presentation of theconflict than any psychological factors.  I think there is no doubt that despitethe fact we intervened in Somalia, the level of attention devoted to there wasconsiderably less than what is devoted to Bosnia, if the newspapers and tv newsI see are any guide.Dave
 59Only Brendan McKay, or maybe ARF, would come to the rescue of Naziracial theory.  Is it distressing Brendan?  The point is that anyeugenic solution to the Jewish Problem as Elias has proposed smacksof pure Nazism.  The fact that Elias' proposal cast the entire "problem"as one of the abnormal presence of Israeli society in the Middle East,and that he buried a slam against U.S. aid to Israel in the midst ofhis "even-handed" solution of the Jewish Question, made it obvious what he had in mind: disolving the Jewish polity.  That *is* a Nazi doctrine:rectification of the "abnormal presence" of the Jewish people within a larger body politic.  Whether your "solution" involves gas, monetary incentives to the poor Jews to marry out, or as Feisal Husseini has said, "disolve the Zionist entity by forcing it to engage the normal surrounding Arab culture," you are engaged in a Nazi project.Just as obvious is your statement: "I will not comment on the valueor lack of value of Elias's proposal."  Still striking the glancingblow, right Brendan?  You could easily see where he was going, but you"will not comment."

 223DEPOSITION of VITALY NIKOLAYEVICH DANIELIAN [1]          Born 1972          Attended 9th Grade          Middle School No. 17          Resident at Building 4/2, Apartment 25          Microdistrict No. 3          Sumgait [Azerbaijan]Really, people in town didn't know what was happening on February 27. I came home from school at 12 o'clock, being excused to leave before the last period in order to go to Baku. When we left, everything in town was fine. Life was the same as usual, a few groups of people were discussing things, soccer and other things. Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my first cousin's birthday, my father, my mother, and I. We spent the day in Baku, and on the 28th, somewhere around 6:00 p.m., we got on the bus for home, figuring that I'd have enough time to do my homework for the next day.When we were entering town, near the 12-story high-rises, our bus was stopped by a very large crowd. The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the bus. The driver says that there are no Armenians on board; then everyone on the busbegins to shout that there are no Armenians on board. The group comes up to the doors of the bus and has people get out one by one, not checking passports, just going by the way people look. We get off the bus, but are not taken for Armenians.We set out in the direction of home. At first we were going to go into an old building where we knew there'd be a place to hide, but the whole road was packed with groups of people, all the way from Block 41 to the 8th Microdistrict. These groups were emptying people's pockets and checkingpassports. People who didn't have passports with them were beaten as well.Then we decided to go home instead. Near the 12-story high-rises I saw burningcars and a great many people standing around the driveways, yelling. "Death tothe Armenians" was written on the cars.When we came into the courtyard--we live in an L-shaped building--it was stillquiet. We went on upstairs, but didn't turn on any lights. We tried to call Baku to warn our relatives, who were due to arrive on Wednesday, not to come. Then there was a knock at the door. It was our neighbors, who advised us to come down to stay at their place. We went down to their place, and they led usto the basement. They live on the first floor and have a basement which you enter across the balcony. We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman was beaten--she ran away naked. Our neighbors' daughter said that that's right, that's what the Armenians deserve, because in Stepanakert, allegedly, people were being killed, 11 girls from Agdam had been raped. We didn't stay very long in the basement. We tried to support one another as best we could, looking out the small window with the iron grating. Papa watched and said things now and then. He said that there was a fire near Building 5, probably acar on fire. Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that they be shown the apartments where Armenians lived. The neighbors said that there weren't any Armenians here, and the group set out for the other wing of the building. They appeared from the 5/2 side of the building, where, I later found out, a woman had been murdered. The woman who ran away naked died. YuriAvakian was killed, too.When the crowd left, the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go home. We went back up to our place and again didn't turn on the light. We started to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while. Wetried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait, but there was no answer. Wedecided she had already left.We sat at home. The phone rang, and the caller asked to speak with myfather. I called him to the phone. It was Jeykhun Mamedov, from my father'swork brigade. He said he was disgusted by what was happening in ourtown. He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us getout of the city. To be quite honest, Papa didn't want to give him our address,but my mother got on the phone and told him. Some 15 minutes after thecall a crowd ran into our entryway. Bursting into the building, they brokedown the door and came into the apartment . . .They came straight to our apartment, they knew exactly where the Armenians were. They came into our place. We tried to resist, but there was nothing we could do. One of them took my parents' passports and began to read them. He read the surname "Danielian," turned the page, read "Armenian," and that alonewas enough to doom us. He said that we should be moved quickly out into the courtyard, where they would have done with us. Another, standing next to him, pushed some of the keys on the piano and said "your death has tolled." They had knives and steel truncheons.I had a knife in my hand. Unfortunately, I didn't use it. I just knew that ifI didn't give up the knife things would be much worse. They struck my parents and said that I should put the knife on the piano. Then, one of them commandedthat we be taken outside. One person was giving orders. When we were taken outdoors I went in the middle, and my mother was behind me. Someone started topush her so she'd walk faster; I let her go ahead of me, and fell in behind her. When he tried to push me, I hit him, and at that moment they began beating my parents; I realized that resistance was completely useless.We are taken out into the courtyard, and the neighbors are standing on their balconies to see what will happen next. The crowd surrounds us. At first they strike me, and I'm knocked out; when I come to, they beat me again . . . I lose consciousness often . . . I don't see or hear my parents, since I was thefirst one hit and was out cold. When I come to I try to pick them up; they arelying next to me. The crowd is gone, the only people around are watching from their balconies. That's it. I try to pick them up, but can't. My left arm is broken. I start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call an ambulance. The bodies of my parents are still warm.We were attacked at around 9 o'clock. I regain consciousness at about 11 and try to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors' door, they push me back and tell me to go away. I go up to the third floor, our neighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; shesends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. I often look out the window to see if the ambulance has arrived, but I can't see very far as a result of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been taken away. Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken away, and everything will be OK.But they were still there. Later, at 8 in the morning as I found out, theambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. If they receivedattention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. Later, around 12 o'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with some "assistants." They call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives, and I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital. There they stitch the woundson my head and rebind my arm. At 3 o'clock I and the other Armenians who are in the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku.In my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people, all of themArmenians. The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians. The onlyAzerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events,before the 27th.Then I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku. I was there 38 days. When I was released, on the 40th day, I found out that my parents were dead. At first they told me that they were in Moscow being treated, but later I found out that they were dead. My father's older brother told me.My father's name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian. He was born in 1938. My mother, born in 1937, was Seda Osipovna Danielian. Papa worked at PMK-20, the leader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator.They were also beaten on the head. The coroner's report stated that theirheads were smashed open and bled profusely.At the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov, who had called. As it turned out later, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. He had called specifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address and dispatch the group. He knew the phone number, but didn't know the address.Before the events I had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on the phone, when he would ask to speak with my father. I knew him by name. He denies that I was the one who answered the phone, saying that my father answered it. He denies that he called from a public phone, saying that he called from home, which also isn't true. I heard noise and the sounds of automobiles. As I later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but had never served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. He was about 20 years old. I don't know if he has since confessed or not. I am sure that he was the one who tipped the crowd off. One-hundred percent sure.My parents were from Karabagh. Father was from the village of Badar, and was two years old when his family moved to Baku, where his elder brothers were togo to school. He was a student at the Naval School, but never graduated. Hewent off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agricultural projects instituted under Khrushchev.] When he returned he lived in Baku, and later moved to Sumgait, helping with the town's construction. Mamma was from the village of Dagdagan, also from Karabagh. She worked in Sumgait, first in a bookstore, and later, on a construction site.My sister is older than I. She lives with her husband here in Karabagh. Ialways loved my parents. That was why I went on to 9th grade, because itwas their dream that I would continue my studies. I finished 8th grade andwanted to enter the Baku Nautical School, and after that, the MilitarySchool. But later I changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon-sider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join the Naval School. I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole lifelong--since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor. My father wanted itmore than anything. He always recollected his youth, telling of the School,and he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it.Now I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here. I will stay at the home of my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days.While in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who hadsuffered as well, like Ishkhan [Trdatov]. He managed to hold them off [attheir residence in Microdistrict 3, Building 6/2, Apartment 6.] for a longtime, lost his father [Gabriel], and by some miracle managed to survive. Ialso learned of Uncle Sasha, from Building 5/2, whose daughter was raped. . . Besides them, Valery--I forgot his last name--was in the hospital too,about a year younger than I, he went to School No. 14. He was riding withhis parents in the car. People were throwing rocks at them, he was hit, andhis parents brought him to the hospital, and he was in our ward. We evencame to be friends. Before that we had just seen each other around town. Butin the hospital we got to know one another better. I learned of the fates ofothers, those who had died, or who were befallen by misfortune . . .Today Suren Harutunian, the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia,was shown on television. To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed to recognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.I was repelled, no, revolted, to hear the Baku announcer who read the decisionof the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of Armenia.After the events in Sumgait and those in Baku, the best solution is to giveKarabagh to Armenia, return it to Armenia, since the people want to livepeacefully with the Azerbaijanis, but everything has to be right before theycan do that.I arrived in Karabagh on April 11. I felt very bad. I had constant headaches.After a while my strength returned. My older sister, Suzanna, took me in. I think that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due.You can't take away what is their due. My parents and I often spoke of NagornoKarabagh, often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. We had even decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia, we would move here for sure. We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much, and that what had been done in 1921--removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia--waswrong. Sooner or later, mistakes should be corrected. And in order to correct a mistake, it must not be repeated; and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh lies in the hands of our government.June 13,1988Stepanakert -- David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | "How do we explain Turkish troops onS.D.P.A.

In Bosnia, "Muslim" is not merely a religious category, but an ethnicone as well.  Actually, here are the two contradictory argumentsmade by people on this subject:(1) There is only Serbian and Croatian nationality, and Bosnian Muslims    are simply Croats and Serbs of Islamic faith.(2) Bosnian Muslims are a separate nationality since they do not feel    themselves to be Croats nor Serbs.In 1968, argument (2) was accepted by former Yugoslavia as valid,and (1) was soundly rejected.  The reasons are pragmatic: even ifBosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam underTurkish rule centuries ago, none of the present generation has anyclue what was their ancestor's actual nationality.  In fact, althoughBosnian Muslims have felt drawn to Croatian or Serbian nationalallegiance, most of them feel they have a separate cultural andhistoric identity.  So, arguments like "yes, but your ancestors wereCroats or Serbs" carry very little weight.  Regardless of whattheir ancestors might have been, as long as Bosnian Muslims feelthat they are a separate national group, that ends the debate.What outsiders say is simply not relevant.>the way the western press use the word 'muslim' in this Bosnian debacle has >kept me wondering when the meaning of muslim/moslem i knew from childhood was >changed in the dictionary. this is just a question. no flames intended!In the case of former Yugoslavia, the date is 1971, when "Muslim nationality"appeared as a census category for the first time.  This was the resultof a sequence of decisions over the past decade, from recognizing"Bosniaks" as an ethnic group (1961) to February 1968 resolution (in B-H)declaring that Muslims are a separate nation, to formal endorsement of this in January 1969, and eventually to the 1971 inclusion of"Muslim nationality" choice in census forms.For comparison, in 1948 census there were three national categoriesavailable to Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina:Serb-Muslims:                        71,991Croat-Muslims:                       25,295Muslims, ethnically undeclared:     788,403This clearly demonstrates that Muslims feel themselves to be their ownnationality.  Only a tiny minority felt able to choose Serb or Croatnationality.  Census results show that Bosnian Muslims haveconsistently opted for a third category: in 1948 they chose "undeclared",in 1953 they chose "Yugoslavs", in 1961 both "Yugoslavs" and "Bosniak ethnic group", and in 1971, 1981 and 1991 they chose "Muslim nationality".Perhaps the term "Bosnian Muslim nationality" is too confusing forthe rest of the world.  But, in the present context, we ARE talkingabout Muslims as nationality; not as a religous group within someseparate national identity.  The reasons are mostly historical andcultural.  Religion plays a smaller role, as a part of culture in general,because the area is simply not known for religious fanaticism.  Politicalfanaticism, yes; religious fanaticism, no.  Group security and survivaldominate people's thinking; not fine points of theology.  In fact,Bosnia-Herzegovina is as well known for religious tolerance in peacetimeas it is known for terrible carnage in wartime.Sincerely,-Josip

Otherwise, back to your own league, son.  I have never seen such immaturity among semitophiles.  ThisAndi Beyer character shows no signs of anti semitism, yetbecause he deviates from the norm of accepted opinion, youattack him.  Why did not anyone venture to answer Andi'squestion in an intelligent and unoffending manner?  The onlyones guilty here of not backing up there viewpoints with factare the Israelophiles.  Now will we please start having someINTELLIGENT conversation?  You all are an insult to you race!{assuming you are also semitic}Now I have a comment concerning Israeli terrorismduring the 1930's and 1940's.  The Hirgun, and other branch -off militant groups, did fight the British do get them out ofPalestine.  Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form ofterrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by theArabs.  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent Britishsoldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were infavor of a compromise with the Palestinians.  In addition, theymassacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributingto the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared theirvery lives.I mention this not because I'm anti semitic [I'm partJewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of theIsraelites pisses me off so.  I'm not as critical of thePalestinians because they were indeed screwed over by theJews.  It 's a damn shame that the Palestinians had to pay forGerman and European anti semitism.Pissed off at Immature,                          Closeminded, Self righteousSemites

By inference, can we assume that you think that anyone of Arab lineage anywhere in the world poses a threat to Israel and, therefore, should be spied on?Perhaps, then, on the basis of Pollard spy case (not to mention theRosenbergs, etc.) you think that all Jewish Americans should be spied on by the ADC.Oh, never mind; this whole spying case has obviously so convoluted your sense of right or wrong in these matters that I have no wish confuse you further.>>Perhaps Yigal is a Greenpeace member?

The 27th was a short day atwork, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decidedto go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the EternalFlame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I hadwalked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakesbehind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24Volga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the car. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit,and the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn't have anything on her head, and her hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They're 40 to 45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to helpthem. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there?When I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn't see what it was, but it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the Eternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circlearound it. I ask, "What's going on?" Someone tells me, "Come listen." Wellthey were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: "BrotherMuslims, our time has come . . . " and something else along that line. Ididn't understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to get a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter. New people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. Andthe comments started: "Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!" and "There'sno need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us." I even heard that: "All Moscow is behind us." Well I watched and listened in and realized that this was no joke. I quietly left and went home.Now before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh, that there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of things, but I didn't have any idea what was really going on.My wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt's house in Baku. I didn't say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around twoo'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and shouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly,like they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a demonstration and move slowly.My wife asks what's going on out there. I say I don't know. I put on someoutdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowdpeople are shouting "Down with the Armenians!" and "Death to the Armenians!" Iwaited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street on the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned and went against the traffic--it's one way there--down the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there was a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same kind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside from the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only youngpeople in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.My wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind ofuneasy and said, "No, let's stay at home instead." An hour went by, or maybe an hour and a half. Well, I wasn't keeping track of the time, I can't sayexactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now onthe side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.I put outside clothes on and went out again. There's noise, an uproar outside,and the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time there were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more aggressive. No, I think, something's wrong here, this isn't any demonstration.They would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run again. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I followed them. I was thinking I'd just watch and see. Who knew where this was leading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one side, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square and heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There was some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals.I heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. "We don't need perestroika, we want to go on living like we have been." Now what did they mean by "living like we have been?" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else. But too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense of others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just in Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I've never seen it anywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.Now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians' apartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn't hear them say "kill them" over the microphone, I only heard "beat them and drive them out." I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, thenanother are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Offto the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and I think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB.There were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn't see any of them try to pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.Well I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was nodemonstration, and I had to protect my family.I left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was nextto the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai-lor's shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some-thing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look becauseafter all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weaponsin there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City Party Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I saw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the cases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15 to 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried off by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standingright next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe about the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha. When I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was about a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He has a package in his hand, and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out. I have never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I've seen a lot of people smoke it, I've seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled around and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.Before I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting. I turned around and saw them running. Well I'll just keep on going like I am, I thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags. And I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the street. He's a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag, which had "Ermeni oryum" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means "Death to Armenians!" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don't reallyknow what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father's name isRafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a darkblue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His family, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on Narimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars; their apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the left. Now Rafik's little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son was carrying a flag that said "Death to Armenians!" I was surprised because before this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being done not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.Well anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, "It's OK, it'll pass, they're young kids, they've just gotten all whooped up." Naturally I didn't want her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And this time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn't see where. Well I think, here we go, the machine's in motion. They weren't handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn't see people drinking and smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and hashish to put in a store window!So the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one would stop them now, they weren't even trying, although, I'll say it again, the police were there, I saw them. And it's not just that the police weren't breaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time. True, at the time I couldn't even imagine that under our government, our much-vaunted leadership--and I'm not afraid to say these words: so many people died, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I couldn't imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be specific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of Sumgait, I couldn't imagine that such things could take place.When they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: "Let's go upstairs." We went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the evening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more.I stopped at "The Corner," a place called that right next to the bazaar. I look and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to the bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old. The crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed toward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person, wheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as though it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more noise, and the glass was flying again.We spent the night at the neighbors'. My apartment was on the first floor,there was really no way to defend yourself there.In the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town. On the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or what happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the bread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying there hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standingyou couldn't even see him.That was on the morning of February 28.

 75       I would like to share with netters a few points I picked up from the PBS    Frontline program regarding Iran's nuclear activities, aired on Tuesday    April 13. For the sake of brevity, I'll present them in some separate    points.    1- As many other western programs, this program was laid on a bed of    misinformation throughout the program, to maximize the effect of the    program on the viewer. Some of the misinformations were as follows:    - It was alleged that:" Late Imam Khomeini objected to Shah's technological    advancements as anti-Islamic, but now things have changed and the proof of    change is that some Iranian merchants are now selling personal computers. "!    These are the most ridiculous lies, one can make about the objectives     of the Islamic Revolution in toppling the Shah and state of the technology    in Iran after revolution.    -Iran was equally accused of using chemical weapons against Iraqi aggressors    while there has never been any proof in this regard, and nobody has seen    Iraqi soldiers or civilians injured by Iranian chemical weapons, in    contrary to what the whole world has seen about Iranian soldiers and    civilians, injured by Iraqi chemical weapons.    - While the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against Iraqi    aggression has been officially announced to be about 117,000 and even most    radical counter-revolutionary groups claim that Iran and Iraq had a total    of one million dead, this program claims that Iran alone has one million    dead left from the war.    - The translation of Iranian officials' talks are not 100% true. For    example when Iranian head of Atomic Energy says that: " It hurts me to    see that Iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda." The     translator says: " It hurts to see that Iran is doing unfriendly     research."!    2- Almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought    by Iranians were of countless dual usage, while the program tries to     undermine their non-military uses, without any reference to Iran's    big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in    near future and its current deficit in electrical power.    3- The whole program is trying to show the Sharif University of     Technology as a nuclear research center, while even the cameramen of the    program know well that in a country like Iran without a so tightly closed    society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university! Taking in account    the scientific advancement of Sharif U. in engineering fields and its    potential role in improvement of Iran's industries and eventually the    lives of people, it is obvious that they are persuading other countries    to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones    in scientific and industrial efforts.    4- A key point in program's justifications is trying to disvalidate as    much as possible all efforts done by IAEA [*] in their numerous visits from    Iran's different sites. They say: "We are not sure if the places visited    by IAEA are the real ones or not" !, or " We can not rely on IAEA's    reports and observation, because they failed to see Iraq's nuclear    activities before" as if they didn't know that Iraq was trying to build    nuclear weapons!    5- As an extremely personal opinion, the most disgusting aspect of the    program was the arrogance of the member of US Senate foreign Affairs,    William Triplet, in his way of talking, as if he was the god talking    from the absolute knowledge!       I hope all Iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their    country in western media, and I hope Iranian authorities continue to    their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs    and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations.Mohammad      [*] International Atomic Energy Agency

We are in the middle ofthe genocide process that Mr. Major has given yet another "green light"to.  Mladic seems to have most of what he wants, but Boban is justgetting his appetite whetted. Because Mladic refuses to allowinternational observers to inspect mass-grave sites and killing centersin places like Foca, Brcko, and Visegrad, it will be years before we havean accurate account of the number killed. In practical terms, it would be impossible to kill all 2,000,000.  Therejust isn't the kind of machinery of crematoria and gas chambers andtransportation lines that the Nazis took 8 YEARS to develop.  Andremember, the Nazis killed minorities in the countries they occupied.  Toactually kill 42% of the population requires extreme genocidalorganization.   But I do claim that the goal of the genocide is the systematicannihilation of Bosnian Muslim culture, by killing as many as isfeasible, by rape, by torture, by the demolition of mosques, libraries,and culture artificts, the burning and renaming of villages, the shellingof civilians.  So that there won't be any of the 2,000,000 or so Muslimswhose lives have not been shattered by the genocide, though they stillmay be alive.And Mr. Major not only finds this acceptable, he helps it along by makingsure that the victims don't have arms to defend themselves.>>-Nick>Mike.--Michael Sells, Department of Religion, Haverford CollegeHaverford, Pa 19041-1392

 207Referring to notes from the personal diary of Russian General L. Odishe Liyetze on the Turkish front, he wrote,"On the nights 11-12 March, 1918 alone Armenian butchers  bayoneted and axed to death 3000 Muslims in areas surrounding Erzincan. These barbars threw their victims into pits, most likely dug according to their sinister plans to extinguish  Muslims, in groups of 80. My adjutant counted and unearthed 200 such pits. This is an act against our world of civilization."On March 12, 1918 Lieut-colonel Griyaznof wrote (from an officialRussian account of the Turkish genocide),"Roads leading to villages were littered with bayoneted torsos, dismembered joints and carved out organs of Muslim peasants... alas! mainly of women and children."Source: Doc. Dr. Azmi Suslu, "Russian View on the Atrocities Committed        by the Armenians Against the Turks," Ankara Universitesi, Ankara,        1987, pp. 45-53.        "Document No: 77," Archive No: 1-2, Cabin No: 10, Drawer         No: 4, File No: 410, Section No: 1578, Contents No: 1-12, 1-18.        (Acting Commander of Erzurum and Deveboynu regions and Commander        of the Second Erzurum Artillery Regiment Prisoner of War,        Lieutenant Colonel Toverdodleyov)"The things I have heard and seen during the two months, until the liberation of Erzurum by the Turks, have surpassed all the allegations concerning the vicious, degenerate characteristic of the Armenians. During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian was permitted to approach the city and its environs. While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to  attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers who had remained in the rear during the war. One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud, and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud and dirt... It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The  Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently. Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days. The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned. ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief, Odishelidge. They were as follows: The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades... More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless  Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood  near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses: 'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.' Thus ten more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when the hole was full it would be covered over with soil. The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one. Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and destroyed the entire population, together with the villages. During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the  Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the  Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with hatred and loathing. Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping him with the iron heel of his boot. Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following: There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads. Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about 25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140  centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age, children and old people. The women's bodies had obvious marks of rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder. A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be  proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel's disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle, instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers, the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and claimed they had laughed because they were nervous. An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command narrated the following incident which took place on February 20: The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head. The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men  of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people among this group were able to save their lives as the result of my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were  released when they learnt that I understood what was going on.  Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered on the streets. On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for murdering an innocent Turk.  When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would  be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: 'How dare you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?' In Erzurum, the  Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same  day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible act. However no result was achieved. In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the  Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular.  The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre. However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders of the leading Armenian figures and commanders.  I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority. Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by the Russians of infamy, would say the following: 'You are Russians. You can never understand the Armenian cause.' The Armenians had a conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear of the Turkish soldiers."Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists                             a single Turkish soul.' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)

Translation of Ha'aretz article.Racism in the Knesset---------------------Coalition requirements on one hand, and the presence of progressive MKsfrom _Meretz_ in the coalition on the other, have compelled Rabin andhis friends to change, to some extent, their attitude towards the Arabpublic and their representatives in the Knesset.  Although he did refuseto view them as partners, taking part in the coalition and joining thegovernment, he did agree to meet with them and to give them a documentof intentions which included a commitment to "work towards a decrease inthe discrimination between Jewish and Arab citizens".  [Decrease WHAT?!?!But posters have told us time and again that such discrimination doesnot exist *at* *all*!  Is Rabin, too, a closet self-hater??? - Yigal].However, racism has not disappeared.  When the Knesset sat to considerwho would staff its various committees, a request was made to put an MKfrom Hadash [the Communist party, one of the "Arab" parties - Yigal] onthe State Comptroller's Committee.  And oh, did that ever stir up astorm -- including in the ranks of Labor -- since many Knesset membersfind it unthinkable that an Arab MK sit on one of the important housecommittees.  "Security secrets" are liable to fall into their hands...This attitude -- which until recently had not even aroused criticism,being so natural and so deeply-embossed upon people's hearts -- holdsthat there are Knesset members who, despite having been elected by tensof thousands of votes, are not entitled to be full partners in the bodywhich represents the people of Israel.  We are not speaking here ofpolitical discrimination -- which would be bad enough in itself -- butof racial discrimination.  The proof: one of the compromises proposedwas that MK Mahamid [an Arab - Yigal] should be replaced by TamarGojanski [a Jew - Yigal] from the same party.  It was not the member'sparty which was considered unfit, but his race...[* Here is a documented case in a respected Israeli newspaper. *]It is worth noting that for the first time since the state's founding, apublic debate has arisen on this subject, as witness the followingarticle:A TEST OF SELF-CONFIDENCEBy Gid'on Levi, Ha'aretz, July 26, 1992Revelations of discrimination against Arabs have become such an integralpart of our daily routine that there is not much effort made to dealwith them.  [Do you hear that, -----?  Please contact this Levi fellowand explain to him how little he knows about Israel.  Please! - Yigal].Except that sometimes the demon bursts out from behind the government'swindow dressing, and then the phenomenon is seven times more serious.Last week provided two more such examples: the Israeli Knesset isfinding it very difficult to allow Arab representation on its moreimportant committees; and Israel Television is finding it no lessdifficult to give a platform to Arabs from the territories.  Seeminglytwo entirely different matters, but in fact they are one and the same.The 13th Knesset proved last week that, even though one third of itsmembers are new faces, it has not renewed its own face at all, at leaston one issue.  Parliamentary traditions may be modernized andparliamentary traditions may become obsolete, and only one traditionendures forever: no Arab shall set foot in the more important committeesof the house.  There has never been and never will be an Arab MK on theExternal Affairs and Defense Committee or on the Finance Committee.Worlds have been overturned over the question of whether or not "togive" Arabs, for the first time, a place on the State Comptroller'sCommittee.The arguments are old and well-known: In all three of the abovecommittees innumerable secrets are revealed -- and woe unto us if anArab should hear them.  One must not make light of such arguments, buttheir significance should also not be exaggerated.  Every Arab MK is notspending all his time waiting for the opportune moment to hand overinformation from the Knesset committee room to Black Pantherheadquarters in Jenin; and not all the aforementioned committees arecontinually occupied in the discussion of top-secret matters, whichcould safely be revealed, for example, to MKs supportive of the JewishUnderground, but not to an Arab MK from the Likud, Labor, or even fromHadash.The Arabs themselves would probably forego membership in the Subcommitteeon Secret Service Matters, but what would happen, one may ask, if MKNawaf Masalha were to hear, God forbid, a review of the Foreign Ministerin an open meeting of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, or evena review of the Army Chief of Staff which, in any case, are regularlyleaked to the next edition of the news.  And what would happen if MKHashem Mahamid were to report on what he had seen with his own eyes atal-Najah?Their non-participation [in important committees] and that of theircolleagues, creates an intolerable situation, where Arab members of theelected house have only semi-positions.  They are good enough foraddressing plenary sessions, and for voting for or against thegovernment and participating in the deliberations of the Immigration andAbsorption Committee.  But they must not, for example, participate inthe process of formulating the state budget in the Finance Committee orin the allocation of resources to local authorities.  In any case, theyhave little part in that.Labor's dependence on the support of the Arab parties has brought aboutsome improvement: MK Hashem Mahamid, will, it seems, participate in theState Comptroller's Committee.  Earlier, there had been a ridiculousattempt made to dictate to Hadash who their representative should be,and thus to prevent the Arab from entering this dubious holy-of-holies,but it soon became clear that there was no legal or constitutionalbacking for such a step.But not to worry: even now the Jewish mind is contriving devices.  Thenew Committee Chair, Roni Milo, has already announced that he will set upsubcommittees aplenty for his committee.  Thus he will decide where itis permissible for Mahamid to participate and where not.  A solutionsuch as this could, by the way, also have been adopted for the rest ofthe committees, thereby completely eliminating the fear of state secretsbeing leaked to the enemy and removing the stain of discrimination fromthe Knesset.[. . .]End ArticleDo you accept that as documentation?Joseph Askew-- Joseph Askew, Gauche and Proud  In the autumn stillness, see the Pleiades,jaskew@spam.maths.adelaide.edu  Remote in thorny deserts, fell the grief.Disclaimer?

This was appraently attempted in thecase of Vanunu and failed.  It has happened before, and there is reasonto believe it still goes on.Read this:From Ma'ariv, February 18 (possibly 28), 1992PUBLICATION BAN        The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many        years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were        sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of        their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever        being made public.By Baruch Me'iriAll those involved in this matter politely refused my request, one wayor another: "Look, the subject is too delicate.  If I comment on it, Iwill be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specificcase, even hint at it, I might be guilty of making public somethingwhich may legally not be published".The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many yearsthere have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced tolong prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or thecrimes of which they were accused ever being made public. Moreprecisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact oftheir arrest, and later on their imprisonment.In Israel of 1993, citizens are imprisoned without us, the citizens ofthis country, knowing anything about it.  Not knowing anything aboutthe fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison,for security offenses, in complete secrecy.In the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA]affair -- we heard about "the third man" being in prison.  But manyyears have passed since then, and what existed then can today nolonger be found even in South American countries, or in the formerCommunist countries.But it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993.The Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution andJustice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early thisweek to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the CabinetLegal Advisor.  Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter:"During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have beenimprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some ofthese cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on thespecifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, buteven on the mere fact of their imprisonment.  In those cases, afterbeing legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prisonwithout public awareness either of the imprisonment or of theprisoner", asserts MK Zucker.On the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, "There isabsolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it isimperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics ofsecurity offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such casesthe Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstancesunder which a trial will not be held in public."However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban onthe mere fact of a person's arrest, and on the name of a personsentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State ofIsrael.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public toknow are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from publicsight and his descent into the abyss of prison."Zucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister ofJustice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they considerthe question.  "The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand thecost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment.  TheState of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detentionand its cause is kept secret", wrote Zucker.The legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney MordechaiShiffman said that, "We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of anycases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned,and whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situationwhich, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy.  Just likecensorship is an unhealthy matter"."The Union is aware", says Shiffman, "of cases where notification of asuspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I amspeaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detaineewas not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the wholefirst month of arrest.  That is done because of the great secrecy."The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist --can challenge the publication ban in court.  But there are cases wherethe family members themselves are not interested in publicity.  Thejournalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone ishappy..."Attorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given thelaws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of aperson for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible. "Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban, and that'sthat.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend longyears in prison without us knowing anything about it."-- Do you find this situation acceptable?Attorney Arnon: "Definitely not.  We live in a democratic country, andsuch a state of affairs is impermissible.  I am well aware thatpublication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- buttotal non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. Consider the trial ofMordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was chargedwith aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  Thetrial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except forthose who were authorized to.  It is somehow possible to understand,though not to accept, the reasons, but, as I have noted, we at leastare aware of his imprisonment."-- Why is the matter actually that serious?  Can't we trust thediscretion of the court?Attorney Arnon: "The judges have no choice but to trust thepresentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools toinvestigate.  This gives the government enormous power, power whichthey can misuse."-- And what if there really is a security issue?Attorney Arnon: "I am a man of the legal system, not a security expert. Democracy stands in opposition to security.  I believe it is possibleto publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- withoutentering into detail.  We have already seen how the laws concerningpublication bans can be misused, in the case of the Rachel Hellermurder.  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without thematter being made public."Attorney Shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security canbe a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect'sarrest, or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment.  "A healthysituation?  Definitely not.  But I am aware of the fact that merepublication may be harmful to state security".A different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal, formeradvisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and GoldaMeir.  "Clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases.  Suchsituations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding mustbe held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedomof expression.  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedomwhich is also harmed by the prohibition of publication."Nevertheless", adds Shtendal, "the legislator allowed for thepossibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where thedamage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than thatwhich may follow from an abridgment of the principles I've mentioned.The authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest withthe Prime Minister or the security services, but with the court, whichwe may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it hasbeen convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt."Nevertheless, attorney Shtendal agrees: "As a rule, clearly such aphenomenon is undesirable. Such an extreme step must be taken only inthe most extreme circumstances."--Yigal ArensUSC/ISI                                                TV made me do it!arens@isi.edu

 33I always believed the statement 'those who do not know their historyare condemned to repeat it (Will Durant ?), but I am beginning tobelieve the opposite is true.Here in t.p.m and in other newsgroups it seems that history ismainly remembered to foment hatred or to be used as a club. In thehistory of my own people there are ample acts of shame, both doneby my people and done to my people. Since I was not party to anyof those acts, I refuse to accept blame for the evil acts that myancestors committed, nor do I direct hatred toward the descendantsof those who committed evil acts against my ancestors.Will all of this discussion rebuild a single mosque? Will it rebuildthe Temple? Somehow I doubt that it will.A post in another group, on the Bosnian war, asked us all to loveeach other, that love would conquer hate. Sadly, I remember a TVinterview with a young woman in Sarajevo (sp?) who was as I remember,a former olympic calibre contestant in the rifle shoot. She was nowtrying to pick-off Serbian snipers. During the communist years shehad married a Serb, who was now fighting against her people. So itseems that hate will conquer love.Is there an odd chance that we might all forget past wrongs and tryand see how we might all live together? It's a damn small planet,which we have come very close to turning into a radioactive ball,glowing softly in space. We seem to have been spared that prospect,shall we now bathe it in each other's blood?Shalom, Salam, and PeaceREB

Armenians have never achieved statehood and independence, they have always been subservient, and engaged in undermining schemes against their rulers. They committed genocide against the Muslim populations of Eastern Anatolia and Armenian Dictatorship before and during World War I and fully participated in the extermination of the European Jewry during World War II.

Where were they?                An Appeal to MankindDuring the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinationalpopulation are vainly fighting for justice within the limits ofthe Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rightsguaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of HumanRights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums,documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated.The USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijanthough they are all empowered to take necessary measures toguarantee life and peace.The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow'stacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation againstAzerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupiedand annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanlydeported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland.Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have alsobeen driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan.Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the CentralAsia where the President and government bodies did not guaranteethem the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only againstAzerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is theArmenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientificexperimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance,for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis areviolated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled,its people are shot. There is persistent negative image ofAzerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over the whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in theUSSR and the United States. One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves andgenerated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerancewhile the truth is that all these shootings and recent events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia onAzerbaijan.It is a well documented fact that before the conflict therewere no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on theissue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidlyand calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had theirrepresentatives in all government bodies of the AzerbaijanSSR.We are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by oneof the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon theSoviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionistsencouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the neighboring lands.The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales,suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.But what about the lives of seven million human beings?If these people are Muslims, does it mean that they areless valuable? Can people be discriminated by their colour of skin or religion, by their residence or otherattributes?All people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothersfor help and understanding. This is not the first appealof Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previousappeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hopethat the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propagandawill one day reveal the extent of our suffering andstimulate at least as much help and compassion forAzerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.THE COMMITTEE FOR PEOPLE'S HELP TO                 KARABAKH (OF THE) ACADEMY OF SCIENCES                 OF THE AZERBAIJAN SSR>   Everyone knows this, even the Turks know this, you know this.

The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians 78 years ago in the Ottoman Empire is being reenacted again - this time in Azerbaijan. There are remarkable similarities between the plots, the perpetrators, and the underdogs. Report taken from The New York Times, Tuesday, March 3, 1992                    MASSACRE BY ARMENIANS BEING REPORTED     Agdam,Azerbaijan,March 2 (Reuters) - Fresh evidence emerged today of a massacre of civilians by Armenian militants in Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian enclave of Azerbaijan.     The republic of Armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed1,000 people in the Azerbaijani populated town of Khojaly last week and massacred men, women and children fleeing the carnage across snow-coveredmountain passes.     But dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to Azerbaijanireports of a massacre.                         Scalping Reported     Azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the regionby helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of theirheads blown off. They said shooting by Armenians has prevented them from retrieving more bodies.     "Women and children have been scalped," said Assad Faradshev, an aideto Nagorno-Karabakh's Azerbaijani Governor. "When we began to pick up bodies,they began firing at us."     The Azerbaijani militia chief in Agdam, Rashid Mamedov, said: "The bodiesare lying there like flocks of sheep. Even the fascists did nothing like this."                                                  Truckloads of Bodies     Near Agdam on the outskirts of Nagorno-Karabakh, a Reuters photographer,Frederique Lengaigne, said she had seen two trucks filled with Azerbaijanibodies.     "In the first one I counted 35, and it looked as though there were asmany in the second," she said. "Some had their head cut off, and many hadbeen burned.

A1.NEW DETAILS OF EXTENSIVE ADL SPY OPERATION EMERGE* INQUIRY: Transcripts reveal nearly 40 years of espionage  by a man who infiltrated political groupsBy Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.SAN FRANCISCO -- To the outside world, Roy Bullock was a small-timeart dealer who operated from his house in the Castro District.  Inreality, he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage andamassed secret files for the Anti-Defamation League for nearly 40years.His code name at the prominent Jewish organization was Cal, and he wasso successful at infiltrating political groups that he was once chosento head an Arab-American delegation that visited Rep. Nancy Pelosi(D-San Francisco) in her Washington, D.C., office.For a time, Cal tapped into the phone message system of the WhiteAryan Resistance to learn of hate crimes.  From police sources heobtained privileged, personal information on at least 1,394 people. And he met surreptitiously with agents of the South African governmentto trade his knowledge for crisp, new $100 bills.These are among the secrets that Bullock and David Gurvitz, a formerLos Angeles-based operative, divulged in extensive interviews withpolice and the FBI in a growing scandal over the nation-wideintelligence network operated by the Anti-Defamation League.Officials of the Anti-Defamation League, while denying any improperactivity, have said they will cooperate with the investigation.  Theyhave refused to discuss Bullock and Gurvitz.Transcripts of the interviews -- among nearly 700 pages of documentsreleased by San Francisco prosecutors last week -- offer new detailsof the private spy operation that authorities allege crossed the lineinto illegal territory.At times, the intelligence activities took on a cloak-and-dagger airwith laundered payments, shredded documents, hotel rendezvous withforeign agents and code names like "Ironsides" and "Flipper."On one occasion, Gurvitz recounts, he received a tip that apro-Palestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for Haifa,Israel.  Although the Anti-Defamation League publicly denies any tiesto Israel, Gurvitz phoned an Israeli consular official to warn him. Shortly afterward, another official called Gurvitz back and debriefedhim.The court papers also added to the mystery of Tom Gerard, a former CIAagent and San Francisco police officer accused of providingconfidential material from police files to the Anti-Defamation League.Gerard fled to the Philippines last fall after he was interviewed bythe FBI, but left behind a briefcase in his police locker.  Itscontents included passports, driver's licenses and identificationcards in 10 different names; identification cards in his own name forfour American embassies in Central America; and a collection of blankbirth certificates, Army discharge papers and official stationery fromvarious agencies.Also in the briefcase were extensive information on death squads, ablack hood, apparently for use in interrogations, and photos ofblindfolded and chained men.Investigators suspect that Gerard and other police sources gave theADL confidential driver's license or vehicle registration informationon a vast number of people, including as many as 4,500 members of onetarget group, the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee.Each case of obtaining such data from a law enforcement officer wouldconstitute a felony, San Francisco Police Inspector Ron Roth noted inan affidavit for a search warrant.The Anti-Defamation League, a self-described Jewish defense and civilrights organization, acknowledges it has long collected information ongroups that are anti-Semitic, extremist or racist. The ADL'sfact-finding division, headed by Irwinn Suall in New York, enjoys areputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information withpolice agencies and journalists. However, evidence seized from Bullock's computer shows he kept fileson at least 950 groups of all political stripes, including theAmerican Civil Liberties Union, Earth Island Institute, the UnitedFarm Workers, Jews for Jesus, Mother Jones magazine, the Center forInvestigative Reporting, the Bo Gritz for President Committee, theAsian Law Caucus and the AIDS activist group ACT UP.The computer files also included information on several members ofCongress, including Pelosi, House Armed Services Committee ChairmanRon Dellums (D-Berkeley) and former Republican Rep. Pete McCloskeyfrom the Bay Area.In their statements, Bullock and Gurvitz said the Anti-DefamationLeague has collected information on political activists in the LosAngeles area for more than 30 years.  They said they worked closelywith three Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies who specialized inintelligence work, a Los Angeles Police Department anti-terrorismexpert and a San Diego County Sheriff's Department intelligenceofficer.A spokesman for the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said he knewnothing of any contact between the deputies and the ADL.  The LosAngeles Police Department, which earlier refused to cooperate with theinvestigation, and the San Diego Sheriff's Department declinedcomment.Bullock, 58, is one of the most intriguing characters in the spydrama.  Although he is not Jewish, he began working undercover as avolunteer for the ADL and the FBI in Indiana in 1954 after reading abook about a man who infiltrated the Communist Party.Bullock moved to Los Angeles in 1960 and was given a paid position bythe ADL as an intelligence operative, he told authorities.  In themid-1970s, he moved to San Francisco and continued his spy operationsup and down the West Coast.To keep his identity secret, his salary has always been funneledthrough Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman -- who has nevermissed a payment in more than 32 years, Bullock said."I was an investigator for the ADL.  I investigated any and allanti-democratic movements," Bullock said.  ". . . Officially, I'm onlya contract worker with Bruce Hochman.  That way, the league would notbe officially connected with me."Bullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from Communiststo Arab-American to gay radicals to skinheads, usually using his ownname but once adopting the alias Elmer Fink."I'm one of a kind," he told police.In recent years, however, his ADL affiliation has increasingly becomeknown, and at one point he was confronted by a skinhead armed with ashotgun who threatened to kill him.In the mid-1980s, he helped San Francisco police solve a bombing at asynagogue by combing through the trash of extremist Cory Phelps andmatching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained bypolice.  In part because of this investigation, he became closefriends with Gerard, who at the time was working in the San Franciscopolice intelligence division.Bullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups.  AnFBI report noted how he investigated one Palestinian group:"Bullock would write reports based on what he found in the trash, andwould share the reports with Gerard.  Bullock also gave the trash toGerard for Gerard to examine.  Gerard would later return the trash toBullock."From a wide range of sources, Bullock compiled files on 9,876individuals and more than 950 political groups.  Gerard, whose filescontained many identical entries, kept files on 7,011 people.In 1987, Bullock and Gerard began selling some of their vast wealth ofinformation to the South African government.  Bullock tells ofmeetings secretly with South African agents at San Francisco hotelsand receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new $100bills.Bullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culledonly from public sources. Once he rewrote an innocuous item publishedby San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen about South AfricanBishop Desmond Tutu and the wife of prominent attorney Melvin Belli --and submitted it as his own work.Bullock said it was Gerard who sold official police intelligence. Bullock said he split about $16,000 from the South African governmentevenly with Gerard, telling him at one point, "I may be gay but I'm astraight arrow."In his interviews with the police and FBI, Bullock talked freely aboutengaging in certain activities that prosecutors say would appear toviolate the law.For example, Bullock admitted to receiving driver's license recordsand criminal histories from Gerard on about 50 people -- a fraction ofthe confidential police data found in his computer.  And he saidGerard gave him complete San Francisco Police Department intelligencefiles on various Nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed underdepartment policy.Bullock said he also received a confidential FBI report on the Nationof Islam that he later shredded at the Anti-Defamation League's SanFrancisco office.Bullock seemed proud of his "Operation Eavesdrop," in which he used apaid informant, code-named Scumbag, to help tap into a White AryanResistance phone message network, listening to the messages left bymembers of the right-wing group.  "For a short time, it waswonderful," he told police.In Los Angeles, ADL operative Gurvitz was hired about four years agoas a "fact-finder" to keep intelligence files and occasionally goundercover to the meetings of target groups.Among other things, he told San Francisco authorities, the Los AngelesADL office kept a record of any Arab-American who had "anti-Israelleanings" or who wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing suchsentiment.Gurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which heattempted to misuse the ADL intelligence network to seek revenge on arival who got a job Gurvitz wanted at the Simon Wiesenthal Center forHolocaust Studies.  Gurvitz got confidential police data on the rivaland threatened to expose him as a Jewish spy to a right-wing hategroup.Gurvitz has since begun cooperating with police and the FBI in theprobe, providing considerable information about the ADL operation. Unlike Bullock, he has been assured he is not a subject of theinvestigation.Gurvitz declined through his father in Los Angeles to be interviewedby The Times. Bullock's attorney said his client would not comment.--Yigal ArensUSC/ISI                                                TV made me do it!arens@isi.edu

Just put this line into your>global kill file:Well, does it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religionand national origin?Between 1914 and 1920, 2.5 million Turks perished of butchery at the hands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only the killing of innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian Armenia. They were persecuted, banished, and slaughtered while much of Ottoman Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines genocide as acting with a   'specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a    national, ethnic, racial or religious group.' History shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate the Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the Armenians. International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time - including U.S. Ambassador Bristol - denounced the x-Soviet Armenian Government's policy as a massacre of the Kurds, Turks, and Tartars. The blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the extermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor those who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians. The eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established,beyond any doubt, that the massacres against the Muslim peopleduring the war were planned and premeditated. The aim of the policywas clearly the extermination of all Turks in x-Soviet Armenian territories.The Muslims of Van, Bitlis, Mus, Erzurum and Erzincan districts andtheir wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed.The massacres in Trabzon, Tercan, Yozgat and Adana were organized andperpetrated by the blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian Government.The principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims wereDro, Antranik, Armen Garo, Hamarosp, Daro Pastirmadjian, Keri,Karakin, Haig Pajise-liantz and Silikian.Source: "Bristol Papers", General Correspondence: Container #32 - Bristol         to Bradley Letter of September 14, 1920."I have it from absolute first-hand information that the Armenians in  the Caucasus attacked Tartar (Turkish) villages that are utterly  defenseless and bombarded these villages with artillery and they murder the inhabitants, pillage the village and often burn the village."Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

But do we write about historical ownership of anyplace - Palestine, Pakistan, Cyprus, Aegean Islands (and the oil thatmay lie beneath them), whatever - for any reason other thanjustification for stomping others?DOES IT TRULY MATTER whose ancestor lived where 20, 200, or 2000 yearsago?  More than how you treat the land and each other?Who is wise enough to decree that a person's right to life, libertyand pursuit of happiness in a particular place depends on accidents ofbirth?  Who can even be sure about the precise tracks of the spermthat birthed the people we wish to despise?IMHO, the American Indians have it right.  We belong to the earth, itdoes not belong to us.  Failure to understand that is a good way tocause lossage all the way around.  My guess is that once we trash ourenvironment sufficiently we shall die along with it - the baby eatingand killing its mother, then dying for lack of milk.Death and disease do not respect national boundaries, not as toxins,disease vectors,  lost farmland/wetlands/forest cover/water supplies,nor any other way.  When we fight over which national group owns whichpiece of turf, we are merely contending for the best vantage pointfrom which to kill others, "our" land and eventually ourselves.That is something of which to be proud.  Very proud.  Makes me glad tobe human.I'm not mindlessly rejecting all nationalism.  Maybe it's fair to askwhether a recent immigrant deserves a share of the infrastructure thatall _my_ ancestors (hah!) labored to produce.  But it's an artificialdistinction: is the recent immigrant, even a refugee, less likely tocontribute to the next generation's legacy than anyone else?  [Inhistory the reverse is often the case: recent immigrants strivehardest.  If nothing else, they fill open eco(l/n)ogic niches.]Then again, my tribe is infinitely better than your tribe, so I canunderstand you all have nothing but plot to knock me off.  While I, ofcourse, will make sure it doesn't happen, even if I must shoot Musliminfants (or bash Jewish ones against the walls of schoolhouses) to doso.  That'll prove my moral superiority, by golly, as well as therightness of my cause.Clearly, there is no higher purpose in life than killing othersbecause they are not like you.  I would never get in the way of suchfun.Let's see:  soc.culture.turkish - Why don't you Turks go back to LakeBaikal where you came from, and leave the land to theGreeks, who stole it fair and square from theScythians?soc.culture.pakistan - Why don't you guys redistributeyourselves over India, as God meant for you to do?soc.culture.jewish, soc.culture.arabic - we stick together,fight together, die together.  We are brothers, andinseparable.talk.politics.mideast - oh well, had to be there.Oded[Planning on being a Scythian irredentist, as soon as I finish mypresent assignment.]P.S.:I can't get a semi-decent death threat anymore?P.P.S.:Yeh, the Native Americans had it right.  We had to kill themoff to keep their sedition from spreading.

 72The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians 78 years ago in x-Soviet Armenia is being reenacted again - this time in Azerbaijan. The stories of survivors of Karabag massacre are in 'Milliyet' today.69 year old Hatin Nine telling:-''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. They toldme: We won't kill you. But the babies have to die in front of your eyes.''72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu:- ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours.  While killing children and babies mercilessly they said: You are  Turks, you must die.''28 year old Gulsum Huseyin:- ''They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of    my eyes.''Are these stories lies? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming?Were these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region?The nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of BritishJournalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Timesarticle. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even beforeTurkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Picturesof people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off.Even the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these "lies." They are saying"exaggeration." That means ''somethings'' have happened but thesituation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalutown was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach...The massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects ofthis massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word.Some of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, abilityto ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre.Yesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's printno news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were theFrench TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabagwas ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.''The age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lotsof organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Securityand Cooperation in Europe), and rules, all designed to fight against humanrights violations. International reactions must be made with internationalcooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claimingto be civilized.Could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of theright to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Whereis the cooperation? Where are the reactions? And the intellectuals,journalists, writers, TV stations of certain western countries suchas France who are fast to claim leadership of "human rights?"Where are you?Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

 5What gives Isreal the right to keep Jeruseleum?  It is the home of the muslim as well as jewish religion, among others.  Heck, nobody ever mentions what Yitzak Shamir did forty or fifty years ago which is terrorize westerners much in the way Abdul Nidal does today.  Seems Isrealis are nowhere above Arabs, so therefore they have a right to Jerusaleum as much as Isreal does.

(Sahak Melkonian - 1920 - "Preserving the Armenian purity")  "The crime of systematic cleansing by mass killing and extermination   of the Muslim population in Soviet Republic of Armenia, Karabag,   Bosnia and Herzegovina is an 'Islamic Holocaust' comparable to the   extermination of 2.5 million Muslims by the Armenian Government   during the WWI and of over 6 million European Jews during the WWII."                  (Tovfik Kasimov - Azeri Leader - September 25, 1992)                  "Today's ethnic cleansing policies by the Serbian dictatorship against  Croatians and Muslims of Yugoslavia, as well as the Soviet Republic  of Armenia's against the Muslim population of neighboring Azerbaijan,  are really no different in their aspirations than the genocide   perpetrated by the Armenian Government 78 years ago against the  Turkish and Kurdish Muslims and Sephardic Jews living in these  lands."

You can defend your position and ideology with documented factsand arguments rather than the crap you regularly post.

That is not Greecebusiness to join the island to Greece. That is up to people in the islandto live or not to live together. They made their decision and they areliving  separetely now.There is a peace there.

We can declare our 12 miles territorialwater which can come close to Athens. How would you like it?If you have any guts why don't you shoot at some Turkish shipsin your dream 12 mile territorial waters?We do not have any city called Konstantinople. We have a citycalled ISTANBUL!!!! All the greeks in Istanbul are beingtreated just any other Turks. There is no difference among peoplein Turkey. You look at your own backyard first before talkingabout human rights in Turkey. What are the rights of Turks in Greece?Nothing. They do not even have basic human rights like right tohave property, fredom of religion, fredom of press, fredom ofvote elect their community leaders. Government of Greece publiclyencourages people to destroy and burn schools, religious places,houses, and farms belong to turkish minority. Then, Greek governmentforces these minorities to go to Turkey without anything with them.You will dream to see Aegean sea as Greek lake but it will neverhappen.

Since,  however, I agree with those who  claim the West Bank, I think I can answer your question thusly: the West  bank was what is called the spoils of war. Hussein ordered the Arab Legion  to attack Israel, which was a poor move, seeing as how the Israelis  promptly kicked his butt. The territory is therefore forefeit.  Retaining  possession of ALL of the West bank is  not desirable, but it beats  national suicide for the Israelis. Put another way, one could ask why it  is that so many Palestinians seem to think that Tel-Aviv belongs to them  and the future state of Palestine. As long as this state of affairs  continues, it seems that to give the Palestinians a place from which they  can launch attacks on Jews is a real poor idea. Giving up the entire West  Bank would be idiotic froma security standpoint.  In addition, there is  the small matter of Jerusalem, which is considered to be part of the West  Bank. The chances of the Israelis giving up Jerusalem are nil. Even  leftists who think Yasser is a really cool dude, like Yossi Sarid, aren't  going to propose giving up Jerusalem. If he did, he'd get run out of town  on a rail.chag sameach!jeff

So far, Israe continues to propose that they remain. The Palestinians propose that they leave. Why should either change their view? It is worth pointing out that the only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require areduction in the Israeli presence. Israel proposes no such reduction....and in fact may be said to *not* be negotiating.------------------------------------------------------------------------Tim: There seem to be two perceptions that **have to be addressed**. Thefirst is that of Israel, where there is little trust for Arab groups, sothere is little support for Israel giving up **tangible** assets in exchange for pieces of paper, "expectations", "hopes", etc. The secondis that of the Arab world/Palestinians, where there is the demand thatthese "tangible concessions" be made by Israel **without** it receivinganything **tangible** back.  Given this, the gap between the two stancesseems to be the need by Israel of receiving some ***tangible*** returnsfor its expected concessions. By "tangible" is meant something that1) provides Israel with "comparable" protection (from the land it is to give up), 2) in some way ensures that the Arab states and Palestine **will be** accountable and held actively (not just "diplomatically) responsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory (by citizens or "visitors").In essence I do not believe that Israel objections to Palestinianstatehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now IF Israelwas assured that any new Palestinian state *would be committed to** co-existing with Israel and held responsible for ALL attacks on Israel from its territory.Aside from some of the rather slanted proposals above,how *could* such "guarantees" be instilled? For example,how could such "guarantees"/"controls" be added to thePalestinian PISGA proposals?Israel is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minuteit lets go (gives lands back to Arab states, no more "buffer zone", givesfull autonomy to Palestinians), ANY and/or ALL of the Arab partiescould (and *would*, if not "controlled" somehow) EASILY return to the traditional anti-Israel position.

Don't take the Bosnian muslims' word for it.     Ask the Holoucost survivors who helped them, you will hear that     the Bosnian muslims (among others) helped them.     I also do object to the term ethnic cleansing, since what is happening     in Bosnia is not ethnic cleansing, they all have the same ethnicity,     what is different is religion. they are Orthodox christians, Catholic      christians, and Muslims.     It's religious cleansing.     Also watching people being rounded up and slaughtered by the slitting of      the throat, raped collectively and systematically, driven out of their     homes by the millions (!!!!), tortured in concentration camps, maimed     and ..... does indeed amount to moral rape.

ThatFatwah is as legitimate as this one. With that kind of "Clergy", it mightbe an Islamic duty to separate religion and politics, if religionmeans "official Clergy".  CAIRO, Egypt (UPI) -- The Cairo-based Arab Organization for Human  Rights (AOHR) Thursday welcomed the establishement last week of the  Committee for Defense of Legal Rights in Saudi Arabia and said it was  necessary to have such groups operating in all Arab countries.  The London-based and Saudi-owned Al Sharq Al Awsat daily newspaper  reported Thursday in a dispatch from Riyadh that the Higher Council of  Ulema (Muslim scholars) on Wednesday had unanimously proclaimed the  formation of the group illegitimate and unacceptable.  In a statement issued in the Saudi capital, the council, Saudi  Arabia's highest religious authority, said it ``unanimously proclaims  illegitimate the creation of this committee and the inadmissibility of  endorsing it because the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is guided by God's  sharia (law) and the Islamic courts are widespread nationwide.''  The statement said no one in the kingdom is prevented from taking  grievances to those courts or to other concerned authorities and that   ``the authors of the bulletin (announcing the founding of the committee)  are well aware of this.''  The council of 21 senior clergymen, which ended its 40th session  Tuesday under chairmanship of Sheikh Abdel Aziz Ben Baz, warned that the  formation of the group will have ``serious consequences,'' but did not  elaborate....>declarations and treaties protecting human rights, particulalrly those>concerning discrimination against women.

 20I have read -just today- two articles dripping of hate and offence toa great deal of people. I could  find as much matching hatred in yourarticles as I have found in some of the self-righteous "Kill-in-the-nameof God" people.I don't know why you are so attcaking to everyone, is it a reaction tothe hatred calls on this newsgroup, or is it a reaction to hardshipsyou have seen and experienced from before...I have learnt not to judge people by only what they say, but rathertry to put myself in their place and aspire to understand theirfeelings.I hope you would be able to do the same with everyone, starting by yourownself, because only through that you could be able to understand yourfeelings and act in a the manner you would aspire everyone to adopt.Thanks for your timeNABIL

 27The honest answer to your question about Arabs who were expelledfrom Jaffa, and/or who fled Jaffa, or anywhere else in Israel, havingthe right to return is:  Yes, unfortunately, they have the right toreturn.  They may apply for citizenship like any other non-Israeli andthen go to >Jaffa and try to buy their house back from the Jews who nowown it.  And now a question and answer for you:  Can the Jews who wereborn and raised in Hebron, or their descendants go back to THEIR homesin Hebron?  The answer is: absolutely NOT, because they were almost allmurdered by their Arab neighbors - the "palestinians".Now, do I think the Arabs should be allowed to even visit"their" homes in Jaffa?  Hell, no.  Bring back the Jews of Hebron, PetahTikva, Jerusalem, Safed, etc. Then, perhaps I would be in favor of Arabsreturning to their Jaffa homes.  However, seeing as no Arab has yet beenable to bring people back from the dead, I'd say that's out.With all the hope in the world,Nissan Ratzlav-Katznraclaw@jade.tufts.edu

Israel also wishes to rule overGaza through Arab collaborators.As Israel denies Gazans the only two options which are compatiblewith basic human rights and international law, that of becomingIsraeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right forself-determination, it must be concluded that the Israeli Jewishsociety does not consider Gazans full human beings. This attitudeis consistent with the attitude of the Nazis towards Jews.

 20I don't know anything about this particular case, but *other*governments have been known to follow events on the Usenet.  Forexample after Tienanmien Square in Beijing the Chinese governmentbegan monitoring cyberspace.  As the former Director of PeaceNet,I am aware of many incidents of local, state, national andinternational authorities monitoring Usenet and other conferencessuch as those on the Institute for Global Communications.  Butwhat's the big deal?  You shouldn't advocate illegal acts in thismedium in any case.  If you are concerned about being monitored,you should use encyrption software (available in IGC's "micro"conference).  I know for a fact that human rights activists in theBalkan-Mideast area use encryption software to send out theirreports to international organizations.  Such message *can* bedecoded however by large computers consuming much CPU time, whichprobably the Turkish government doesn't have access to.Howard Frederick, University of California, Irvine Department ofPolitics and Society

 12Message-ID: <1rgnhb$aqj@usenet.INS.CWRU.Edu>NNTP-Posting-Host: thor.ins.cwru.edu   Anas Omran has claimed that, "the Israelis used to arrest, andsometime to kill some of these neutral reporters."  The assertionby Anas Omran is, of course, a total fabrication.  If there is anonce of truth iin it, I'm sure Anas Omran can document such a sadand despicable event.  Otherwise we may assume that it is anotherpiece of anti-Israel bullshit posted by someone whose family doesnot know how to teach their children to tell the truth.  If Omranwould care to retract this 'error' I would be glad to retract theaccusation that he is a liar.  If he can document such a claim, Iwould again be glad to apologize for calling him a liar.  Failingto do either of these would certainly show what a liar he is.

I think the answer to Mr. Mayamsky's question can be found in the  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^(Mr. Mamaysky's)   first amendment to the US Constitution.   Amendment I                                           (1791)   Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of   religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or   abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the   right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition   the government for a redress of grievances.   SteveI do not say that freedom of speech should be banned. Far from it.I am merely suggesting that there are certain things which can beuniversally agreed to be morally incorrect. There are not many suchthings. But there are some. As an example:(1) murder is morally incorrect(2) the idea that one group of people is somehow racially inferior toanother is morally incorrectetc.The point is that any action which serves to promote a morallyincorrect action should be forbidden. This implies that no one has theright to say that an innocent person should be murdered. Regardless offreedom of speech, I may not stand on a street corner and advocate themurder of innocent people. The reason for this is that murder is amorally incorrect action.In the same way, since bigotry is morally incorrect in the narrowdefinition which we have given it, (2), I, nor any one else, has theright to stand on a street corner and promote bigotry. Such anenforcement does in no way deny any one their rights as guaranteed bythe first amendment. It merely ensures that no person may be thetarget of an attempt to deny him a fundamental moral right, such asthe right to not be murdered, and the right not to be discriminatedagainst.I believe, Mr. Berson, that to blindly accept the constitution is aterrific mistake. We must cinstantly question the constitution andinterpret it in a way befitting the society in which we live. Anythingshort of such an effort would render us little more than trainedmonkeys, who are able to merely repeat what they have heard withoutpaying the slightest bit of attention to the intent of the document inquestion.Would you disagree, Mr.Berson?Harry.

My point is that it will inevitably turn out that way, and we can saveourselves a lot of pain and trouble by simply letting people sort out theirproblems on their own. Colonial interventions, even in Haiti, haven't worked in the past. They had a 102 coups from 1845-1915. The US invaded in 1915. And leftin 1933, almost 17 years after they had intended to. Was it a success? Well,look at Haiti today and of the past 40 years and decide for yourself. It _was_a success so long as the US was in, from what I remember. But it didn't lastlong, obviously.|> >There is an implicit assumption here that we as outsiders have a right to sit|> >in judgement of another people, and to then act on it.

History shows that within the last 170 years, Greeks played that game twice: They used Istanbul Patriarch Grigorios in 1822 to instigate the Morea rebellion that resulted in the massacres of the Muslim people. Again, the Orthodox Patriarch Constantine V invited the Russian Czar Nicholas II to invade the Ottoman Empire 'in the name of Jesus,' and save his flock from Ottoman rule.

They construct a wooden figure, cover it with    clothing which they claim is that of the ancient Jews, and they    burn it publicly in the middle of a multitude of the ignorant and    the fanatic. It often happens that this multitude, already excited    by the tales of the suffering of Christ that has been made to them    at the Church, is exaulted at the appearance of the execution of he    who is supposed to have betrayed Christ, and works up a great anger    against the Jews...For a long time we have known that each year,    on such a day, they will cut off the heads and arms of the corpses    in our cemetery and will burn them with great solemnity.

We ourselves see the flames and hear the cries of    hatred and vengeance against the Jews.''[42]>>[42] Ashkenazi Community, Corlu, to AIU no.8783, 2 May 1902, in AIU     Archives (Paris) II C 8, with report printed in El Tiempo of 1 May 1902.Source: Professor Stanford J. Shaw, 'The Jews of the Ottoman Empire and the        Turkish Republic,' New York University Press, New York (1991). pages 202-203:  <<In 1865, immediately after enactment of the new Organic Statute for the  Jewish community, and just as Jewish capital from Europe was beginning  to have an effect in Istanbul, local Armenians and Greeks started a pogrom  against Jews immediately across the sea of Marmara at Haydarpasa, terminus  of the Anatolia railroad, with three hundred Jews massacred and many more  beaten and raped before the disturbance was stopped after the Sultan sent  his personal guard across the bay to protect the Jews [39].  In later years, ritual murder attacks against Jews, carried out mostly  by native Greeks, Armenians, and, in Arab provinces, by Maronites and  other Arab Christians, often with the assistance of the local European  consuls, took place throughout the empire. There were literally thousands  of incidents continuously until World War I, in Southeastern Europe as far  west and north as Monastir and Kavalla, in Istanbul, at Gallipoli and  the Dardanelles, at Salonica, and in all the Arab provinces as far south  as Damascus and Beirut and in Egypt at Cairo and Alexandria. These  invariably resulted from accusations spread among Ottoman Christians  by word of mouth, or published in their newspapers, often by Christian  financiers and merchants anxious to get their Jewish competitors out of  the way or to divert onto the Jews Muslim anger at reports of Christian  massacres of Muslims in Southeastern Europe or Central Asia, resulting  in individual and mob attacks on Jews, and the burning of their shops  and homes.  Individual experiences were horrible. Jews constantly went in fear of  Armenian or Greek attacks in the streets of Ottoman cities. In Egypt  and Syria, it was usually the Greeks who led the way, in many cases  with the assistance of local Armenians and Syrian Christians, whose  Greek, Arabic and French-language newspapers often printed all the  rumors they could find regarding Jews, evidently with the desire of  instigating violence. The Syrian Arab Christians in particular spread  their long-standing anti-Semitic hatreds from Syria to Egypt, where  their monopoly of the local press and their espousal of popular causes  such as Egyptian nationalism and opposition to the British rule, enabled  them to spread their anti-Jewish message among the Muslim masses with  little question or opposition.  On 20 June 1890, thus, Sir Evelyn Baring (later Lord Cromer), British  High Commissioner in Egypt, received the following report from David  and Nissim Ades, in Cairo:    ''Sir,      I beg sir to draw to your attention to the violent articles which      has (sic) appeared in an Arabic paper called El Mahroussa which      contained nothing but lies and false accusations against the Jews,      especially those (the issues) of the 14th, 17th and 19th instant.      Now, Sir, are we to have here an anti-Semitic party amidst fanaticism,      Greeks, Armenians, etc., or is he to be allowed to continue to poison      the people's minds with exaggeration and painted words? In an article,      he asserted that the Jews use Christian blood for Passover, of course      this has caused a deal of excitement.'' [40]  Whenever Greek and other Orthodox religious authorities or prominent  Greek business leaders or consuls were asked to help to stem the violence  or reduce tension, they invariably indicated their cooperation and then  failed to do anything to prevent attacks or punish those who stimulated  or led them. [41]  The leader of the Ashkenazi community of Corlu complained to the  president of AIU [Alliance Israelite Universelle] in 1902 about  persistent Greek attacks against its Jewish quarter:    ''The fanatic Greeks of our city, as of other places in Thrace,    have the habit of, contrary to the spirit of real Christianity,    making a replica of Judas Iscariote and of burning it on the night    of Holy Saturday. They construct a wooden figure, cover it with    clothing which they claim is that of the ancient Jews, and they    burn it publicly in the middle of a multitude of the ignorant and    the fanatic. It often happens that this multitude, already excited    by the tales of the suffering of Christ that has been made to them    at the Church, is exaulted at the appearance of the execution of he    who is supposed to have betrayed Christ, and works up a great anger    against the Jews...For a long time we have known that each year,    on such a day, they will cut off the heads and arms of the corpses    in our cemetery and will burn them with great solemnity. We make    no complaint about this in order not to create differences between    the two communities. But this audacious madness of these fanatics    has increased. We ourselves see the flames and hear the cries of    hatred and vengeance against the Jews.''[42]>>[39] El Tiempo, 28 April 1926; Galante, Istanbul I, 185; Galante, Documents V,     340-41.[40] FO 78/430, enclosed in Baring no.207 to Lord Salisbury, Cairo,     25 June 1890, reprinted in Landau, 'Ritual Murder Accusations', p.450.[41] Jacob Landau, 'Ritual Murder Accusations and Persecutions of Jews     in Nineteenth Century Egypt', Sefunot V (1961), 425-427; for example     see report in BAIU [Bulletin de l'Alliance Israelite Universelle:     Deuxieme Serie (Paris)], first semestre 1881, pp.66-67.

 42Nntp-Posting-Host: euclid.ucsd.edu WASHINGTON - A stark reminder of the Holocaust--a speech by Nazi SS leader Heinrich Himmler that refers to "the extermination of theJewish race"--went on display Friday at the National Archives.The documents, including handwritten notes by Himmler, areamong the best evidence that exists to rebut claims that theHolocaust is a myth, archivists say."The notes give them their authenticity," said Robert Wolfe,a supervisory archivist for captured German records.  "He wassupposed to destroy them.  Like a lot of bosses, he didn't obey hisown rules."The documents, moved out of Berlin to what Himmler hopedwould be a safe hiding place, were recovered by Allied forces afterWorld War II from a salt mine near Salzburg, Austria.Himmler spoke on Oct.4, 1943, in Posen, Poland, to more than100 German secret police generals.  "I also want to talk to you,quite frankly, on a very grave matter.  Among ourselves it should bementioned quite frankly, and yet we will never speak of it publicly.I mean the clearing out of the Jew, the extermination of the Jewishrace.  This is a page of GLORY in our history which has never beenwritten and is never to be written."  [Emphasis mine--rje]The German word Himmler uses that is translated as"extermination" is *Ausrottung*.Wolfe said a more precise translation would be "extirpation"or "tearing up by the roots."In his handwritten notes, Himmler used a euphemism,"Judenevakuierung" or "evacuation of the Jews."  But archivesofficials said "extermination" is the word he actuallyspoke--preserved on an audiotape in the archives.Himmler, who oversaw Adolf Hitler's "final solution of theJewish question," committed suicide after he was arrested in 1945.The National Archives exhibit, on display through May 16, isa preview of the opening of the United States Holocaust MemorialMuseum here on April 26.The National Archives exhibit includes a page each ofHimmler's handwritten notes, a typed transcript from the speech andan offical translation made for the Nuremberg war crimes trials.---From p.A10 of Saturday's L.A.

 47 The Armenians were deeply anti-semitic as well. In the May 10, 1936 edition of 'Hairenik Weekly' the vice-mayor of Bucharest, Rumania is quoted as saying:"The Armenians helped us not to become the slaves of the Jewish elements in our country."In another edition, an author named Captain George Haig writes:"And the type of Jew who is imported to Palestine...is not anything to be proud about. Their loose morals, and other vices were unknown to the Arabs prior to Balfour Declaration, on top of  all communist activities were the cause of most of the Arab criticism."[1]As Uzun exposed, the Armenians were fascist. Before Pearl Harbor, the Dashnak daily 'Hairenik' (not to be confused with the Tzeghagrons'Hairenik Weekly') expressed pro-Nazi sentiments:"And came Adolf Hitler, after herculean struggles. He spoke to the racial heart strings of the German, opened the  fountain of his national genius, strock down the spirit of defeatism...At no period since the World War had Berlin conducted so realistic, well organized, and planned policy as now, since Hitler's assumption to power...And whatever others may think concerning Hitlerism and Fascism as a  system of Government, it is proved that they have revitalized and regenerated the two states, Germany and Italy."[2][1] Captain George Haig, 'The Case of Palestine,' in Hairenik    Weekly, Friday, September 25, 1936.[2] 'Hairenik,' official organ of the Dashnaktsuitune, Sept.     17, 1936; quoted in John Roy Carlson, 'The Armenian Displaced    Persons' (see endnote 1), p. 21.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

Obviously,in presenting it, he (quite legitimately and deliberately) takes a pointof view to an extreme which might not have been what you intended, butthat is one of the best ways to demonstrate a "slippery slope" type ofargument, which I believe was his aim.I very frankly believe that the ADL will be proved innocent in thiscase.  I doubt there's enough evidence to weigh against them even in acivil court, where preponderance of the evidence, not evidence beyondany reasonable doubt, is the standard for "winning" such a case.  That,however, does not prevent me from seeing the merit in Anwar's point.

There are situations where a few extremely vocal, and usually radical, people **do** drive people away, effectively stifleall other ("opposing") views and generally "take over". *Clearly*,the purpose behind such actions is *to deprive* others of *their*freedom of speech through overt and covert coercion and domination of the "media form" in question.

More particularly, how can this be controlled within the structure of these newsgroups?--Tim Clock                                   Ph.D./Graduate studentUCI  tel#: 714,8565361                      Department of Politics and Society     fax#: 714,8568441                      University of California - IrvineHome tel#: 714,8563446                      Irvine, CA 92717

That said, one could draw a parallel between>    the Russians in Turkestan, and the Serbs in Bosnia.A typical Nazi/racist Armenian of 'ASALA/SDPA/ARF'. Can it be thatcriminal/Nazi Armenians of ASALA/SDPA/ARF hate Muslims for ideological reasons regardless of what they do? Between 1914 and 1920, your criminalArmenian grandparents committed unheard-of crimes, resorted to all conceivable methods of despotism, organized massacres, poured petrol over babies and burned them, raped women and girls in front of their parents who were bound hand and foot, took girls from their mothers and fathers and appropriated personal property and real estate. And today, they put Azeris in the most unbearable conditions any other nation had ever known in history.                               Source: The Times, 2 March 1992CORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKHANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES TO INVESTIGATE THE MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS...As we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw the scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as they ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to journalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts of the hills.The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians last week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death or missing... Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there was a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer ripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We swung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.We had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round again, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a valley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung round again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired repeated blasts.Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in fact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter. I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window, its cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on "our side". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a search-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two M24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed flying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second crocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters were there to give covering fire if necessary.The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani official told us that there were now five former Soviet military helicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. "They have signed contracts to fly for us," he said. The helicopter we engaged in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian pilot, but fighting for the Armenians.We had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an heated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer white wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four corpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies on the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back towards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.Back at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the civilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were covered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor mortis. They had been shot.What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave, and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN, POLITELY DECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS, AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

Oh great.  Today's headlines tell us that the Croatians and Bosnians are fighting  each other throughout central Bosnia, in battles that the UN describes  as "out of control" and atrocities being reported from both sides.  These people are crazy.  Right now the Serbians are Number One in violations of human rights  and general carnage but crazed violence in the Balkans is like the  car-rental business - if you're Number Two you just try harder.  The region doesn't need military aid; it needs psychiatric help!  We should bomb them with Thorazine and then air-drop several   regiments of psychotherapists.  There is no justification for US military involvement because there  is no reasonable, definable goal we can achieve militarily.  Sure,  if send in several divisions of mechanized infantry we can probably  stop the more egregious fighting; but only as long as we are willing  to stay in there and play policeman and get shot at.  The minute we   leave or turn our backs they'll be at each other's throats again.                                  BTW, with Bosnia's large Moslem population, why have nations like   Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Egypt, and others with either money   or strong military forces not spoken out more forcibly or offered   to help out Bosnia?   The Turkish ambassador has ocassionally said  a thing or two, but that's all; I see no great enthusism from any   of those places to get *their* hands dirty.    Why does the US always  get stuck with this stuff?  Besides, there's no case that can be made for US military involvement  there that doesn't apply equally well to, say, Liberia, Angola, or  (it appears with the Khmer Rouge's new campaign) Cambodia.

Earlier, the leadership of the Milli Mejlis called the proposal to summona special session of the Supreme Soviet a coup attempt. But the deputy forthe Parliament, Rahimzade, doesn't consider that the deputates have the objective of removing Milli Mejlis and its chairman from the power. It concerns theserious analysis of the social, economic and foreign policy activity of therepublic's authority. Rahimzade said that the deputates for the Parliament,ejected from their duties one year ago have the rights to express their opinionon these questions.   The Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan (340 deputates) was dissolved one year ago,when it attempted to bring Ayaz Mutalibov back to the power.   The functions of S.S. were handed over to Milli Mejlis, consisting of 50deputates (25 "democrats" and 25 "partocrates"). At that time "democrats" and"partocrates" came to an agreement that Milli Mejlis wouldn't exist for a long time and would be dissolved after parliamentary elections. At the same time,the deputates ejected from their duties were guaranteed that they could summona session of the Supreme Soviet any time and went in for political activity outof the Parliament. --0--THE PROSPECTS OF TRADE/ECONOMIC COOPERATION BETWEEN AZERBAIJAN AND ESTONIA    Baku (May 19) Turan: The prospects of signing trade-economic agreementbetween Azerbaijan and Estonia were discussed in the meeting of the Foreign Minister Tofig Gasimov with the group of experts of the Ministry of Economics,Minister of Foreign Affairs and Estonian Bank administration on May 18.

Vahid Ahmedov considers that the CIS economic zone proposal to create a common tax system contradicts independent economic policy of the republic. According to Abbas Abbasov, the pact of cooperation proposals, submitted forthe discussion of the leaders of CIS states in Moscow on May 14, has a numberof unfavorable points for Azerbaijan.   Such announcements of two deputy prime-ministers sound sensational on thebackground of the fact that the president of Azerbaijan and the chairman ofthe Parliament noted the necessity of the republic on joining the CIS economiczone.--0--THE QUESTIONS OF GRANTING CREDIT TO AZERBAIJAN WILL BE DISCUSSED IN MOSCOW     Baku (May 19) Turan: Today, Azerbaijani delegation headed by the directorof the foreign relation department of the Ministry of Finance of the republicalong with the representatives of the National Bank will leave for Moscow tohold consultation with Russian government on granting credit to Azerbaijan.

Accounts of the witnesses and the confessions of the condemned themselves,prove that their crimes were committed together with the Armenian military unitsand with the knowledge of the headquarters of the Russian army unit, where theyserved.    The announcement points out that the attempts to represent these soldiersas ordinary mercenaries who have nothing to do with the Russian army are also unfounded. For there are irrefutable evidences that these soldiers were on thelist of one of the military unit's of Russian commandos in Yerevan.   Certain Russian circles try to conceal the fact of direct participation ofthe Russian army in the undeclared war of Armenia against Azerbaijan from theRussian community. Azerbaijan's prosecutor's announcement follows, that thistype of actions can make the situation in the region much more complicated.--0--AZERBAIJAN'S PARLIAMENT INTENDS TO APPEAL TO RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT REGARDING THESIX ACCUSED SOLDIERS     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed, parliament of Azerbaijanis considering the question of appealing to Russian parliament about the sixaccused soldiers' fortune.

The North Caucasus is regarded as an integral part of Armenia in the documents of this organization. Admitting the non-realizability of "reunion" ofthe North Caucasus and "Armenia proper" at present, the front is appealing to the UN, presidents of Russia, Armenia and the United States to consider theneed to establish Armenian autonomies on the Caucasus.     To attain these goals, the Armenian organization considers it necessary tocarry out on the North Caucasus the forms and methods of activity "identical tothose in Nagorno Karabakh". Besides the decision to fund cells of Armeniannational-liberation fronts in every settlement and to appeal to leaders ofArmenian terrorist groups in Greece and Iran to sent to the North Caucasus instructors for training of Armenian youth to wage secret wars was adopted.

The Armenians living in Russia appealed to the president Yeltsinwith a request "to display firmness in asserting the rights of Russiansoldiers". At the same time, Armenian mass media call legal proceedingson the case in Baku as "a farce aimed at getting more arms from Russia".     The Karabakh Armenians have issued a threat recently. If one couldbelieve the Yerevan agency "Snark", the Armenians in Karabakh presentedan ultimatum to authorities in Azerbaijan. The essence of this ultimatumis that if Russian soldiers are not shown mercy, three Azeri prisoners inKarabakh will be shot dead.     It is simple to explain such "touching attitude of Armenians" tothe six Russian soldiers' fate. If by chance the sentence is executedit will cause not anti-Azeri but anti-Armenian reaction, as the accusedRussian soldiers were recruited in Yerevan by the former Defence Ministerof Armenia and then transferred to Karabakh.     If the soldiers get mercy, Armenian side will think highly of itssaving of lives of "innocent Russians". --O--NEW PROVOCATIONS OF ARMED FORCES OF ARMENIA     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: According to the Defence Ministry ofAzerbaijan on May 20-21, the firing on the territories of Azerbaijanfrom the military bases on the territory of Armenia was in progress.

Thus one gives 1100 Rubles or 120 Manats for one US dollar.Taking into account the official exchange-value of the Manat with respect to Ruble which is 1-10, the national currency fell in value10 percent. Meanwhile the exchange-value of the Manat to the Ruble isthe same at banks, state establishments and in trade.     According to the representatives of the business circles andexperts, the present situation is explained by the fact that the rublesare bought by the local businessmen. They need rubles for financialoperations in Russia. As the remittance of payments from the republicsof the former USSR to Russia is a great problem now, many businessmenarrange deals in cash. Taking into consideration the volume of business with Russia, counted by billions, it is not hard to imagine how much Rubles in cash the businessmen need. --O--THE DISCUSSION OF PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION BILL WILL LAST TILL MID JULY    Baku (May 22) Turan: According to the president's decree, theexpert group, including representatives of the Parliament and presidential apparatus, are working out new wording of the Constitutionof the Republic of Azerbaijan.

Baku (May 22) Turan: As Turan agency was informed, Russian representativeto the talks on Karabakh, Vladimir Kazimirov, doubted in realization of the Trilateral initiative. He expressed this opinion during a telephone talk withthe representatives of Azerbaijan. At the same talk he declared, that in casethe peace process deadlocked, Russia would pursue Yeltsin's initiative itself.     Such statement from the Russian diplomat, who is one of the authorsof the Trilateral initiative, suggests that the Russian leadership ispaving the way for complete exclusion of the USA and probably Turkey fromthe peacemaking process. This statement can also mean, that Russia andUS having achieved understanding on Bosnian problem, have agreed on partialUS departure from Transcaucasia.--0--FATE OF 645 MILLION TONS OF OIL WILL BE DECIDED THIS SUMMER   Baku (May 22) Turan: The president of Azerbaijan State Oil Company,Sabit Bagirov, declared recently that complete treaty on development ofoil fields Chirag, Azeri and Guneshli would be signed this summer.As it is known, western oil companies AMOCO, BP-STATOIL, PENNZOIL-RAMCO have an interest on development of these three richest Caspianfields.

Specialists value total reserves of these three fields to be 645million ton. 310 million of them fall on Azeri field, 180 mln.tonon Geneshli and 150 mln.ton on Chirag.   The exploitation of these fields is to last tens of years and it is tobring in Azerbaijan 100 billion dollars in revenue. In addition to the neteconomic profit, Baku calculates upon the political support of the West inthe defence of its interests at the international scene.   As president Elchibey said in his closest encirclement "the May of1993 will be one of the most difficult periods for Azerbaijan and itsindependence and we have to stand these tests".--0--THE SCIENTIST-LAWYERS OF RUSSIA APPEALED TO THE PRESIDENT OF AZERBAIJAN   BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: As the press-service of the president of Azerbaijaninforms, today, the appeal of the Institute of the Government and law of theRussian Academy of Sciences to president Elchibey was received.The appeal contains the call "to display mercy, humanism and clemency on the death sentences of the former servicemen of the Russian ArmedForces".   The authors of the appeal point out, that they don't justify theparticipation of the Russian servicemen in the war against the azeri people,don't call in question the lawfulness of the passed sentence, denouncethe mercenary according to the UN principals, and they are sorry about theRussian servicemen being drawn in such grave crime.    At the end of their letter, scientists, mentioning the soldiers'mothers' tears and grief, their praying day and night of safety, ask thepresident of Azerbaijan to "save those guys".   It should be noticed, that unlike lawyers, soldiers' mothers,taking part in the inquiry, called the cause of their grief onlyRussian policy. According to their words, the leaders, that lay downlives of Russian men to achieve their political aims, must be madeanswerable.    Unfortunately, the appeal didn't mention the grief of the mothersof Azerbaijani soldiers, killed by sentenced Russian servicemen.--0--ARMENIAN ARTILLERY CONTINUES FIRING ON AZERI DISTRICTS     BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: On May 22, two soldiers of National army ofAzerbaijan were killed during the "Grad" shelling of the villages ofKolly Gyshlag, Shaifly, Shotaraz, Nyachaflar of Zangelan district ofthe republic from the territory of Kafan district of Armenia.

The transportation of man power and military equipmentto this district is in progress. According to reports the enemy is settingup a new weapon emplacement to fire on the regional centre and near byvillages.     According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the concentrationof man power and military equipment is observed in Krasnoselskydistrict of Armenia which borders on Azerbaijan as well as on thefrontier with Fizuli district. --O--AZERI PRIME-MINISTER IS LEAVING FOR GREAT BRITAIN  BAKU ( MAY 22 ) TURAN : The Minister of Foreign Economic Relations,Rauf Garayev, in his interview to Turan agency said, that"Great Britain is the biggest foreign economic partner of Azerbaijanafter Iran". The business cooperation between the two countriesdevelops in such spheres as oil - industry, the manufacture of oilextraction equipment, communication and agriculture.  According to the Minister's words, the forthcoming visit ofAzerbaijani Prime-Minister, Panah Huseynov, to Great Britain on May23-24, is very important. It is expected, that the visit willhelp, to solve the problems of opening in Azerbaijan the branchoffices of some British banks, insurance firms; to concludecontracts on the sphere of manufacture of agricultural equipment; onbuilding in Azerbaijan off shore oil platforms, and reconstruction of theentire communication system of Azerbaijan.   In Garayev's view, the expansion of the cooperation with Great Britainwill have a great political meaning for Azerbaijan.   According to politicians and reviewers in Baku, at present, GreatBritain as an European state is close to Azerbaijan. The continuation ofthe economic and political cooperation of the two states is foreseen. --O--           \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\              T U R A N    N E W S    A G E N C Y                     Baku - Azerbaijan                      Phone: (8922) 66-7977  66-7833                    Fax: (8922) 66-2009                   Telex: 142168 META SU           \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\                  Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

Just trying to get this clear, so please bear with me.  As far as  I can tell, you're proposing the following rules of engagement  between Israel and the Palestinean resistance.  Please feel  revise this preliminary draft as necessary:  1) Israeli military personnel are fair game at any time, in uniform     or out, on duty or off.  In practice, since any male or female     Israeli of military age (18-?) may be off-duty military, all but     young children are acceptable targets.  Since the existence of     Israel constitutes indication of hostile intent, no further     provocation is required.  2) To avoid inpermissable violations of the rights of non-combatant     Palestineans, Israeli forces must not engage Palestineans     without positive identification as military personnel, clear     indication of aggressive intent, and a clear field of fire.    a) Positive identification may be assured by either checking for       Palestinean military uniform, by posession of exclusively       military armament (ie, T78 MBTs or MiG-29 aircraft), or       self-identification (either verbal or documentary).  Note       that dual-use military/civilian weaponry such as hand grenades,       AK-47 rifles, and RPG launchers do not constitute positive       military identification and require closer inspection such       as document checks.    b) Aggressive intent (as distinct from merely 'hostile' intent,       which is the normal condition) may be assured by not less       than three rounds of incoming fire separated by intervals       of not less than ten seconds between rounds.  Note that a       single burst of automatic-weapon fire counds as one round,       as does a volley of rocket fire from more than one source.       As noted above, dual-use weaponry may NOT be assumed to       originate from military personnel, and thus do not justify       armed response.    c) A clear field of fire can be guaranteed by making a positive       military identification of all personnel in the target area of       the weapons to be used.  Note that aggressive intent need not       be proven for all possible targets.  Thus, if IAF aircraft       are attacked by a SAM crew it is not necessary to check the       papers of each crew member so long as none are obviously       civilians (as indicated, for instance, by the posession of       uniquely civilian weaponry such as stones, axes, and Molotov       coctails.)  Since it is often difficult for IAF elements to       land and make the necessary checks, ground forces should       first screen prospective strike areas before AGM fire.       For ACM purposes, a cockpit-to-cockpit pass within 5 meters       is usually sufficient for this purpose, but may be repeated       if necessary.--- D. C.

The image-conscious Armenians sorely feel a missing glory in their background. Armenians have never achieved statehood and independence, they have always been subservient, and engaged in undermining schemes against their rulers. They committed genocide against the Muslim populations of Eastern Anatolia and x-Soviet Armenia before and during World War I and fully participated in the extermination of the European Jewry during World War II. Belligerence, genocide, back-stabbing, rebelliousness and disloyalty have been the hallmarks of the Armenian history. To obliterate these episodes the Armenians engaged in tailoring history to suit their whims. In this zeal they tried to cover up the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds before and during World War I.And the justice is long overdue.Source: Documents: Volume I (1919).

And rightly so. The author of this crap is a racist, pure  and simple. He obviously has no qualms about being open with it, either,  unlike some other Arab- and Mulsim-bashers on the Net. Now, I for one, am not going to look at Joachim's posting and infer from it  that all Jews think this way. Sure, there might be some, but this view is not  a part of Judaism, and it is stupid to believe that all Jews' minds are this  twisted. However, some Muslims might look at Joachim's flame as a  reaffirmation of their worst fears about Jews: that they all hate Arabs and  are racists.For this reason, I am alarmed that not more Jews on the Net have spoken out  against what Joachim has said. They have the chance to possibly change the  anti-semitic views of some people on the net, to show them that all Jews do  *not* hate all Arabs and Muslims, just like all Muslims do *not* hate all  Jews. Yet they are missing that chance.

(One shouldremember that the Golan Heights had been part of the area that was tobe in Britain's Palestine Mandate, slated to become part of the Jewishstate, until Britain traded it to France for other considerations.

Now, please provide us with your corrections.Source: Stanford J. Shaw, on Armenian collaboration with invading Russianarmies in 1914, "History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey (VolumeII: Reform, Revolution & Republic: The Rise of Modern Turkey, 1808-1975)."(London, Cambridge University Press 1977). pp. 315-316."In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city  of Van, whose 33,789 Armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population,  closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire...Leaving Erivan  on April 28, 1915, Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized  and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during  the next two days.""Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions, Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims. Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common soldiers began deserting in droves.""With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks, Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations, who in turn massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of expected arrival of the invading Russian armies.""...Meanwhile, Czar Nicholas II himself came to the Caucasus to make final plans for cooperation with the Armenians against the Ottomans, with the  president of the Armenian National Bureau in Tiflis declaring in response: 'From all countries Armenians are hurrying to enter the ranks of the   glorious Russian Army, with their blood to serve the victory of Russian  arms...Let the Russian flag wave freely over the Dardanelles and the  Bosporus. Let, with Your will, great Majesty, the peoples remaining  under the Turkish yoke receive freedom. Let the Armenian people of Turkey  who have suffered for the faith of Christ receive resurrection for a new  free life under the protection of Russia.'[155]Armenians again flooded into the czarist armies.

The entire Turkish population of Armenia (which Armenians called Tartars) constituted at least about 40% of the total population of Armenia was deliberately exterminated. (For the population statistics, please look to the book of Richard Hovannessian, "Armenia on the Road to Independence.") I listed three books earlier of such a monstrous crime by the writings of one Armenian, one American, and one British. They are: "Men Are Like That" by Leonard R. Hartill; "Adventures in the Near East" by A. Rawlinson; "World Alive, A Personal Story" by Robert Dunn. Also, I personally have copies of documents of this crime by the writings of two Armenians and also one American. The official British report about this massacre mentioned in one of these documents (Lord Curzon-Aharonin interview) is the report of the British High Commissioner to Caucasia, Sir Oliver Wardrop."An appropriate analogy with the Jewish Holocaust might be the systematic extermination of the entire Muslim population of  the independent republic of Armenia which consisted of at  least 30-40 percent of the population of that republic.

 12Providing safety and security for one's own people is the mostfundamental responsibility of any political entity. For the Palestinianleadership to refuse to accept this responsibility, i.e. take theresponsibility to protect their people from radical Palestinian elementswho are opposed to the peace process, is reprehensible. To argue that aPalestinian police force would be established in order to control peacefulpolitical groups only reinforces the reality that the Palestinianleadership, so far, can not exercise control over radical Palestinianelements nor effectively deal with the killing of Palestinians byPalestinians. This is a problem that can only be solved by thePalestinian people.

 71From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>Subject: rejoinder. Questions to IsraelisTo:  shaig@Think.COMSubject: Ten questions to IsraelisDear Shai,Your answers to my questions are unsatisfactory.In the answer to my first question, concerning the nonexistence ofIsraeli nationality, your answer conflicts with information I havereceived from other quarters, according to which there are twodistinct categories of classifying Israelis:  Citizenship(Ezrahut) and Nationality (Le'um). The former is used on passportsetc, and the later for daily identification in Israeli society. Iam told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at alltimes and present them at many public places, almost every day.These ID cards make clear who the holder is, a Jew or an Arab.You maintain that this mainly because of religious servicesprovided. But do you really believe that this is the reason ?Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that itserves no other purpose ?In the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact thatIsrael has no fixed borders, you state that Israel's borders were'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace'. According to what Iread, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, hadplans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and intoTransjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish ofBen-Gurion to not declare Israel's borders, when Israel wasestablished, as this might restrict Israel's opportunities forlater expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on thefact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised theland to them. But according to biblical sources, the area Godpromised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were theborders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to usetoday ?  Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can't it declare whatit considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be abase for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, onecannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as anumber of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist publicofficial. I don't think your answer is honest.  You refer me toVanunu's revelations about Israel's nuclear arsenal withoutevaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he saidthe truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, whyshould he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty.Somebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning'hidden prisoners' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article fromMa'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners doexist in Israel. What do you think about that ?You imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such away to 'cast aspersions upon Israel'. Such terms have often beenused by the Soviet Union against dissidents: They call the SovietUnion into disrepute. If my questions are not disturbing, theywould not call forth such hysterical answers. My questions areclearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts. I would bevery happy if you could convince me that what I am told aboutIsrael were just fabrications, but alas you have failed to do so.I suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honestdiscussion. This is a sign of weakness, not of strength.I hope you will muster the courage to seek the full truth.

As usual, the bias of the 'Center for Policy Research' echoes    through this newsgroup.  Here we have an enraged Likudnik who    is venting his spleen, and you portray it as if this is going    to become policy.  You don't say what the response to Matza's    suggestion was.  Do do not mention whether he was refering to    terrorists caught in the act, which could be a clear cut case    of self-defence.  Would you care to elaborate on this, or was    this all you wanted to say on the matter.  Why don't you give    up this 'Center for Policy Research' crap, and just post your      biases without trying to legitimize them with a pompous name?>Ha'aretz, 16 March1993:>>Today a private security firm and units from the IDF Southern>Command will begin installation of four magnetic gates in the Gaza>strip, as an additional stage in the upgrading of security>measures in the Strip.>>The gates will aid in the searching of [non-Jewish] Gaza residents>as they leave for work in Israel.

A laudable precaution.          Every single thing you post about Israel is posted to portray    Israel as negatively as you can.  Deliberate omissions are an    integral part of the shtick.  And it's not only the incidents    that you do not mention, but even the stories you do post are    fraught with omissions, which change the entire meaning.  The    absurdity of your respectable name cannot hide your bias.    In your effort to portray Israel in an unfavorable light, you     have accomplished nothing, except to prove that a respectable     sounding label like the Center for Policy Research is nothing     but a smoke screen for someone with a heavily biased attitude     against Israel and the need to vent it.  You         This 'Center for Policy Research' stuff is nonsense.
 56It is appropriate to add what Himmler said other "inferior races" and "human animals" in his speech at Posen and elsewhere:From the speech of Reichsfuehrer-SS Himmler, before SSMajor-Generals, Posen, October 4 1943["Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression", Vol. IV, p. 559]-------------------------------------------------------------------One basic principal must be the absolute rule for the SS man: wemust be honest, decent, loyal, and comradely to members of our ownblood and to nobody else. What happens to a Russian, to a Czech,does not interest me in the slightest. What the nations can offerin good blood of our type, we will take, if necessary by kidnappingtheir children and raising them with us. Whether nations live inprosperity or starve to death interests me only in so far as weneed them as slaves for our culture; otherwise, it is of no interestto me. Whether 10,000 Russian females fall down from exhaustionwhile digging an anti-tank ditch interest me only in so far asthe anti-tank ditch for Germany is finished. We shall never be roughand heartless when it is not necessary, that is clear. We Germans,who are the only people in the world who have a decent attitudetowards animals, will also assume a decent attitude towards thesehuman animals. But it is a crime against our own blood to worryabout them and give them ideals, thus causing our sons andgrandsons to have a more difficult time with them. When someonecomes to me and says, "I cannot dig the anti-tank ditch with womenand children, it is inhuman, for it will kill them", then Iwould have to say, "you are a murderer of your own blood becauseif the anti-tank ditch is not dug, German soldiers will die, andthey are the sons of German mothers. They are our own blood".Extract from Himmler's address to party comrades, September 7 1940["Trials of Wa Criminals", Vol. IV, p. 1140]------------------------------------------------------------------If any Pole has any sexual dealing with a German woman, and by thisI mean sexual intercourse, then the man will be hanged right infront of his camp. Then the others will not do it. Besides,provisions will be made that a sufficient number of Polish womenand girls will come along as well so that a necessity of thiskind is out of the question.The women will be brought before the courts without mercy, andwhere the facts are not sufficiently proved - such borderlinecases always happen - they will be sent to a concentration camp.This we must do, unless these one million Poles and thosehundreds of thousands of workers of alien blood are to inflictuntold damage on the German blood.

 105Today marks the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of2.5 million Turks and Kurds in Eastern Anatolia and x-SovietArmenia. The following letter, which represents a small portion of the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical documents, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs, was sent to President Bill Clinton, members of Congress, editors, program directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and radio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people. On April 23 of every year, the people of Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the lost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their lives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations may live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and prosperously.------------------------- letter ----------------------------------During the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day, Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland, which is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocidein order to shift international public opinion away from its politicalresponsibility.2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish Genocide.3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism throughthe ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-SovietArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence throughterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supportersof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community frommaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorialdemands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish peoplewill unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victimsof the Turkish Genocide demand:1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian Dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish andKurdish people;3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officiallyrecognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuseto succumb to all Armenian political pressure;5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of 2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in theefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new generation has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politicallymature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, throughall necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the armed struggle. Therefore, the victims of the Turkish Genocide call uponall Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in the political, cultural and religious activities of the 78th Anniversaryof the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

This cease fire agreement was violated by Jordan,who did not allow Jews to visit holy sites under their control.  TheJordanians also bulldozed every synagoge in the city.  They turned aJewish cemetary into a hotel, and used the gravestones in theirlatrines.Israel has allowed individuals of all religions intoJerusalem, protected holy sites, and demonstrated its fitness tocontrol the city.Also, I should point out that Islam is not centered inJerusalem, but has holy sites there.  The home of Islam is Mecca,where all Muslims should make a pilgramage (the hajj).

I'll let the rest of the net judge this on its own merits.Source: 'The Sunday Times,' 1 March 1992 (a British Weekly, written by         Thomas Goltz, from Agdam, Azerbaijan.)    ARMENIAN SOLDIERS MASSACRE HUNDREDS OF FLEEING FAMILIES.    The spiralling  violence gripping the  outer republics of  the formerSoviet Union gained new impetus  yesterday with cold-blooded slaughter ofhundreds of women and children in war-racked Nagorno-Karabakh.    Survivors  reported that  Armenian soldiers  shot and  bayoneted morethan 450  Azeris, many of  them women and  children, who were  fleeing anattack  on their  town. Hundreds,  possibly thousands,  were missing  andfeared dead.    The attackers  killed most of  the soldiers and  volunteers defendingthe women  and children.  They then  turned their  guns on  the terrifiedrefugees. The few  survivors later described what  happened:" That's whenthe real  slaughter began," said  Azer Hajiev,  one of three  soldiers tosurvive. "The  Armenians just shot and  shot. And then they  came in andstarted carving up people with their bayonets and knives."    " They were shooting, shooting, shooting", echoed Rasia Aslanova, whoarrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way throughArmenian lines. She said her husband, Kayun, and a son-in-law were killedin front of her. Her daughter was still missing.    One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off.    The survivors  said 2000  others, some of  whom had  fled separately,were still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from theirwounds or the cold.    By late  yesterday, 479 deaths had  been registered at the  morgue inAgdam's morgue,  and 29 bodies  had been buried  in the cemetery.  Of theseven corpses  I saw awaiting  burial, two  were children and  three werewomen, one shot through the chest at point blank range.    Agdam hospital was  a scene of carnage and terror.  Doctors said theyhad 140 patients who escaped slaughter, most with bullet injuries or deepstab wounds.    Nor were they safe in Agdam. On friday night rockets fell on the citywhich  has a  population  of 150,000,  destroying  several buildings  andkilling one person.Now wait, there is more.           IT'S INHUMANE TO IGNORE THIS VIOLENCEThe stories of survivors of Karabag massacre:69 year old Hatin Nine telling:-''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. They toldme: We won't kill you. But the babies have to die in front of your eyes.''72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu:- ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours.  While killing children and babies mercilessly they said: You are  Turks, you must die.''28 year old Gulsum Huseyin:- ''They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of    my eyes.''Are these stories lies? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming?Were these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region?The nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of BritishJournalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Timesarticle. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even beforeTurkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Picturesof people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off.Even the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these "lies." They are saying"exaggeration." That means ''somethings'' have happened but thesituation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalutown was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach...The massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects ofthis massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word.Some of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, abilityto ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre.Yesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's printno news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were theFrench TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabagwas ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.''The age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lotsof organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Securityand Cooperation in Europe), and rules, all designed to fight against humanrights violations. International reactions must be made with internationalcooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claimingto be civilized.Could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of theright to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Whereis the cooperation? Where are the reactions?

If a 'dog's prayers were answered, bones would rain from the sky.Did you know that the word 'Karabag' itself is a 'Turkish' name? Before 1827, before the Russians and their 'zavalli kole' Armenians, drove all the Turks/Muslims out, it was a Turkish majority town. Well,anyway, it is not surprising that Armenians also collaborated with the Nazis. "Wholly opportunistic the Dashnaktzoutun have been variously  pro-Nazi, pro-Russia, pro-Soviet Armenia, pro-Arab, pro-Jewish,  as well as anti-Jewish, anti-Zionist, anti-Communist, and   anti-Soviet - whichever was expedient."[1][1] John Roy Carlson (Arthur Derounian), 'Cairo to Damascus,'     Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1951, p. 438.  As a dear friend put it, the Tzeghagrons (Armenian Racial Patriots) was the youth organization of the Dashnaktzoutun. It was based inBoston (where ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle is located) but had followers in Armenian colonies all over the world. LiterallyTzeghagron means 'to make a religion of one's race.' The architectof the Armenian Racial Patriots was Garegin Nezhdeh, a Nazi Armenianwho became a key leader of collaboration with Hitler in World War II.In 1933, he had been invited to the United States by the CentralCommittee of the Dashnaktzoutun to inspire and organize the American-Armenian youth. Nezhdeh succeeded in unifying many localArmenian youth groups in the Tzeghagrons. Starting with 20chapters in the initial year, the Tzeghagrons grew to 60 chaptersand became the largest and most powerful Nazi Armenian organization.Nezhdeh also provided the Tzeghagrons with a philosophy: "The Racial Religious beliefs in his racial blood as a deity.  Race above everything and before everything. Race comes first."[1][1] Quoted in John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), "The    Armenian Displaced Persons," in 'Armenian Affairs,' Winter,    1949-50, p. 19, footnote.Now wait, there is more.THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armeniansin the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of thefour-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officialsand casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aidworkers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one ofthe last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full controlof Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiationsin Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fightingretreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of thedead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was firstsuppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-strickenAzerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000dead.The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  "HojaliDisaster", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum onpreliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  ElmanMemmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed inthe Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and morethan 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswomanof the Azeri Ministry of Defence.FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the InternationalRed Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city ofAgdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosquefrom  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. "We  did  not count  thebodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy," MrZen Ruffinen said. "We have some idea since we gave the body bagsand products to wash the dead."Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  thenumber of  dead in the  massacre. "Don't  get worked up.  It willtake  several months  to  get a  final  figure," the  43-year-oldlawyer said at his small office.Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years toreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalistuprising in Baku in January 1990.Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  powerthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactlywhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, beingthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by therepublic's forensic department. "This  is just a small percentageof the dead," said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensicscientist. "They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember thechaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and buryour dead within 24 hours."Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 andaxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highlandsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs ofdeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penisescut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov'sreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of thosebelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  stilldisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, sixpolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, thenames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. Themost heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so farcomes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  ahelicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27February."There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground tocount properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the streamand the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village," MrManafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopterpilot."People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children andone  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  waspulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land butArmenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had toreturn."There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  incirculation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last fewmonths and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojaliat the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villagestaken over by Armenian forces.THE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

The estimated population of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem. Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the  Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897, however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character  notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian  Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the  southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia."  (See also Map 1. Historic Armenia and Map 4. Administrative subdivisions of  Transcaucasia).In 1920, '0' percent Turk. "We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as  ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work  of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village.  Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts  into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable  and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets  completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They  found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border  into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole  length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to  Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain  plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of  Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for  howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the  scattered bones of the dead."                              Ohanus Appressian                            "Men Are Like That"                                   p. 202. "In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists a single Turkish soul.  It is in our power to tear away the veil of illusion that some of us  create for ourselves. It certainly is possible to severe the artificial  life-support system of an imagined 'ethnic purity' that some of us  falsely trust as the only structure that can support their heart beats   in this alien land."            (Sahak Melkonian - 1920 - "Preserving the Armenian purity") <1993Apr24.042427.29323@walter.bellcore.com>ddc@nyquist.bellcore.com (Daniel Dusan Chukurov 21324)>           The world's inaction when the conflict began over the mostly>Christian Armenian enclave inside Muslim Azerbaijan might have>encouraged the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, said the>Moscow-based activist, who's part Armenian.No kidding. The Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces,massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between 1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocentTurks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia today.A merciless massacre of the civilian population of the small Azeri town of Khojali (Pop. 6000) in Karabagh, Azerbaijan, is reported to have taken place on the night of Feb. 28 under a coordinated military operation of the 366th mechanized division of the CIS army and the Armenian insurgents. Close to 1000 people are reported to have been massacred. Elderly and children were not spared. Many were badly beaten and shot at close range. A sense of rage and helplessness has overwhelmed the Azeri population in face of the well armed and equipped Armenian insurgency. The neighboring Azeri city of Aghdam outside of theKarabagh region has come under heavy Armenian artillery shelling. City hospital was hit and two pregnant women as well as a new born infant were killed. Azerbaijan is appealing to the international community to condemn such barbaric and ruthless attacks on its population and its sovereignty.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

I will not comment on thevalue or lack of value of Elias's "proposal".  I just want to saythat it is very distressing that at least two people here areprofoundly ignorant of Nazi racial doctrine.  They were NOTlike Elias's idea, they were more like the opposite.  Nazis believed in racial purity, not racial assimilation.  An instructive example is the Nazi attitude to Gypsies.  According to Nazi theoreticians, Gypsies were an Aryan race.  They were persecuted,and in huge numbers murdered, because most European Gypies wereconsidered not pure Gypsies but "mongrels" formed from the pure Gypsy race and other undesirable races.  This was the key difference between the theoretical approach to Jews and Gypsies, by the way.  It is also true that towards the end of WWII even the "purist" Gypsies were hunted down as the theory was forgotten.Brendan.(email:  bdm@cs.anu.edu.au)

They are news because they are the exceptions. And the 'Islamic Holocaust'is much the topic of the day. The historical evidence proves that during the period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion and national origin. Armenians perpetrated acts of sabotage, destroyed telephone cables, blew up bridges, blocked passes, set up ambushes, attacked security stations and small Turkish outposts behind the Ottoman Army lines on the one hand, and on the other ruthlessly attacked Turkish and Kurdish villages, slaughtering the Turkish population indiscriminately, women, children, old and young alike. Innocent Muslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death, or massacred with axes and swords, or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burntalive as can be seen below.Widespread Armenian massacres of innocent Muslims took place in regions of Van, Kars, Sivas, Erzurum, Bitlis, Erzincan, Mus, Diyarbakir and Maras. The Ottoman Army, while fighting to prevent the Russian invasion,also had to deal with Armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from behind. The Armenian genocide of the Muslims spread to all parts of Eastern Anatolia. Starting from late 1914, Armenians committed widespread massacres and genocide in Eastern Anatolia, because the arenawas left to the Armenians. Almost every Turkish town and village from Erzincan up to Azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide by Armenians and the Turkish genocide has been documented by Armenian, Russian, American, British, Ottoman, German, Austrian and French journalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this centurycommitted by the blood-thirsty Armenian genocide squads.The Ottoman Army, liberating Trabzon, Bayburt, Erzincan, Erzurum, Kars and other regions from the Russians, saw that the cities and their villages had been destroyed and burnt, people slaughtered, massacred.The massacres conducted by Armenians, which became a black stain forhumanity, shocked and disgusted even the Russian, British, German,Austrian, French and American authorities.Almost every Ottoman document is related to Armenian massacres and cruelties. The inhuman treatment, cruelties, atrocities, genocide by Armenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent Moslem Turkish and Kurdish people, are sufficiently reflected in historical documents. Even today over seventy-five years later, the terrifying screams of the victims of these cruelties can be heard.Source: Documents: Volume I (1919).

Although two months have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of Armenian gangs, I have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the Armenians at  almost every step. All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people  well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun. They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the  Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs.  I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is  destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air. Although there are  speculations that Armenian gangs murdered Austrian and German prisoners as  well, I could not get the supporting evidence in this regard, but there is  proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war."

 131From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>Subject: Unconventional peace proposalA unconventional proposal for peace in the Middle-East.---------------------------------------------------------- by  Elias DavidssonThe following proposal is based on the following assumptions:1.      Fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, toeducation, to establish a family and have children, to humandignity, the right to free movement, to free expression, etc. aremore important to human existence that the rights of states.2.      In the event of a conflict between basic human rights andrights of collectivities, basic human rights should prevail.3.      Between the collectivities defining themselves asJewish-Israeli and Palestinian-Arab, however labelled, anunresolved conflict exists.4.      This conflict has caused great sufferings for millions ofpeople. It moreover poisons relations between communities, peoplesand nations.5.      Each year, the United States expends billions of dollarsin economic and military aid to the conflicting parties.6.      Attempts to solve the Israeli-Arab conflict by traditionalpolitical means have failed.7.      As long as the conflict is perceived as that between twodistinct ethnical/religious communities/peoples which claim theland, there is no just nor peaceful solution possible.8.      Love between human beings can be capitalized for the sakeof peace and justice. When people love, they share.Having stated my assumptions, I will now state my proposal.1.      A Fund should be established which would disburse grantsfor each child born to a couple where one partner is Israeli-Jewand the other Palestinian-Arab.2.      To be entitled for a grant, a couple will have to provethat one of the partners possesses or is entitled to Israelicitizenship under the Law of Return and the other partner,although born in areas under current Isreali control, is notentitled to such citizenship under the Law of Return.3.      For the first child, the grant will amount to $18.000. Forthe second the third child, $12.000 for each child. For eachsubsequent child, the grant will amount to $6.000 for each child.4.      The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources whichhave shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to theIsraeli-Arab conflict, including the U.S. Government, Jewish andChristian organizations in the U.S.  and a great number ofgovernments and international organizations.5.      The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed'marriages in Israel/Palestine, all of whom would have relatives on'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose itsethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of atruly civil society. The existence of a strong 'mixed' stock ofpeople would also help the integration of Israeli society into theMiddle-East in a graceful manner.Objections to this proposal will certainly be voiced. I willattempt to identify some of these:1.      The idea of providing financial incentives to selectedforms of partnership and marriage, is not conventional. However,it is based on the concept of affirmative action, which isrecognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse theperverse effects of segregation and discrimination. Internationallaw clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed atreducing racial discrimination and segregation.2.      It may be objected that the Israeli-Palestinian conflictis not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict, but that it isa conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenouscolonized society that can only regain its freedom by armedstruggle. This objection is based on the assumption that the'enemy' is not Zionism as ideology and practice, butIsraeli-Jewish society and its members which will have to bedefeated. This objection has no merit because it does not fulfillthe first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamentalhuman rights over collective rights (see above)3.      Fundamentalist Jews would certainly object to the use offinancial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages'. From theirpoint of view, the continued existence of a specific Jewish Peopleoverrides any other consideration, be it human love, peace ofhuman rights.  The President of the World Jewish Congress, EdgarBronfman, reflected this view a few years ago in an interview hegave to Der Spiegel, a German magazine. He called the increasingassimilation of Jews in the world a <calamity>, comparable in itseffects only with the Holocaust. This objection has no meriteither because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions (seeabove)4.      It may objected that only a few people inIsrael/Palestine, would request such grants and that it would thusnot serve its purpose. To this objection one might respond thatalthough it is not possible to determine with certainty the effectof such a proposal, the existence of such a Fund would help mixedcouples to resist the pressure of their respective societies andencourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racistattitudes.5.      It may objected that such a Fund would need great sums tobring about substantial demographic changes. This objection hasmerits. However, it must be remembered that huge sums, more than$3 billion, are expended each year by the United States governmentand by U.S. organizations to maintain an elusive peace in theMiddle-East through armaments. A mere fraction of these sums wouldsuffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorableclimate towards the existence of 'mixed' marriages inIsrael/Palestine, thus encouraging the emergence of anon-segregated society in that worn-torn land.I would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal aswell for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningfuldiscussion and enrichment.Elias Davidsson Post Box 1760 121 Reykjavik, ICELAND

Hundreds are missing.Scattered amid the withered grass and bushes along a small valley and across the hillside beyond are the bodies of last Wednesday's massacre by Armenian forces of Azerbaijani refugees.From that hill can be seen both the Armenian-controlled town of Askeran and the outskirts of the Azerbaijani military headquarters of Agdam. Those who died very nearly made it to the safety of their own lines.We landed at this spot by helicopter yesterday afternoon as the last troops of the Commonwealth of Independent states began pulling out. They left unhindered by the warring factions as General Boris Gromov, who oversaw the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, flew to Stepanakert to ease their departure.A local truce was enforced to allow the Azerbaijaines to collect their dead and any refugees still hiding in the hills and forest. All the same, two attack helicopters circled continuously the nearby Armenian positions.In all, 31 bodies could be counted at the scene. At least another 31 have been taken into Agdam over the past five days. These figures do not include civilians reported killed when the Armenians stormed the Azerbaijani town of Khodjaly on Tuesday night. The figures also do not include other as yet undiscovered bodiesZahid Jabarov, a survivor of the massacre, said he saw up to 200 people shot down at the point we visited, and refugees who came by different routes have also told of being shot at repeatedly and of leaving a trail of bodies along their path. Around the bodies we saw were scattered possessions, clothing and personnel documents. The bodies themselves have been preserved by the bitter cold whichkilled others as they hid in the hills and forest after the massacre. All are the bodies of ordinary people, dressed in the poor, ugly clothing of workers.Of the 31 we saw, only one policeman and two apparent national volunteers were wearing uniform. All the rest were civilians, including eight women and three small children. TWO GROUPS, APPARENTLY FAMILIES, HAD FALLEN TOGETHER, THE CHILDREN CRADLED IN THE WOMEN'S ARMS.SEVERAL OF THEM, INCLUDING ONE SMALL GIRL, HAD TERRIBLE HEAD INJURIES: ONLY HER FACE WAS LEFT.

Perhaps you heard aboutanti-trust in the business world.Since we are debating the legality of a commercialtransaction, we must use the laws governing the guidelinesand ethics of such transactions. Basic ANTI-TRUST law saysthat, while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose ofinvesting, you can not acquire a large number of thoseshares with the intent or controlling IBM. You can do soonly if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori . Clearly,the Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had somedesigns, they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate.They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews.The palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in theold tradition of arab hospitality. Being a multi-ethnic /multi-religious society, accepting the jews as neighbourswas no different, just another religion. Plus they paid fairmarket value, etc... They did not know they were victims ofan international conspiracy. (I'm not a conspiracy theoristmyself, but this one is hard to dismiss).>>As to whether the Jews wanted to live in peace, maybe.>>However they wanted and still want an exclusively Jewish>>state, where Jews are in control and Jews are the masters of>>the land.

However, if Armenians invade the United States and forceAmericans to either flee or become Armenians, it will not succeed. Similarly,the Armenians of Karabakh are being forced by Azerbaijan to either become Azeris or leave, and it also will not succeed, as has been demonstrated. Karabakh, irrespective of its geographic position situated technically withinthe Stalin-prepared borders of Azerbaijan, has been long oppressed and eventually was invaded in 1991 by Azeri OMON and Soviet forces, resulting in the northern third of this Armenian area being depopulated of Armenians. The Armenians have been fighting back ever since. Clearly, you feel it rather ridiculous for Armenians, of let's say Glendale, California, to engage in an independence movement for a free and independentGlendale. Similarly, the Azerbaijanis are engaging in a losing attempt atclaiming sovereignty over the land and people of Karabakh, who have livedcontinuously in Karabakh a thousand years before the first Central Asian invaders ever stepped foot in the Caucasus.

My only question is this: Do powerful countrieshave a moral obligation to interefere in other countries iftheir own interests are not threatened. I cite an essay byCharles Krauthammer in the Time (this week) that discussesthis issue eloquently.For example, did US and other European countries abandon theirmoral compunctions when they chose not to send military troopsto Bombay when Hindus, in a rare fit of impassioned rage, killedmany Muslims recently.

However,This is quite a misrepresentation.  After WWI, many Bosnian Muslims werekilled and their land taken over by Serbs, and the motive was plunder,not some fictitious "supression of rebellion."  Even earlier, one canpoint to the destruction of mosques in Serbia itself and expulsion ofMuslims.  Here is what Dr. Vaso Cubrilovic, political adviser to theSerbian monarchic regime, says in his memorandum "The Expulsion of theArnauts" which he presented to the royal government of Stojadinovicon March 7, 1937, in Belgrade:   The Mode of Removal   -------------------   [ describes how expulsion of ethnic Albanians from Kosova is to proceed   through state terror and "private initiative", i.e. Chetnik plunder: ]   Private initiative, too, can assist greatly in this direction.  We should   distribute weapons to our colonists, as need be.  The old forms of Chetnik   action should be organized and secretly assisted.  [...]   ...the whole affair should be presented as a conflict between clans and,   if need be, ascribed to economic reasons.  Finally, local riots can be   incited.  These will be bloodily suppressed with the clans and the   Chetniks, rather than the army.   There remains one more means, WHICH SERBIA EMPLOYED WITH GREAT PRACTICAL   EFFECT AFTER 1878, that is, by secretly burning down Albanian villages   and city quarters.(Emphasis above is mine.)  These events in Serbia itself forced out virtuallyall Muslims during late 19th century.  This policy of state terrorismagainst Muslims, aided by Chetnik "private initiative," has continued in WWIIand today.  For example, Muhamed Hadzijahic in his book "Od tradicije do identiteta: Geneza nacionalnog pitanja bosanskih Muslimana" (Sarajevo:Svjetlost, 1974) writes (pg. 235) how Serbs killed a Muslim in Focain WWII even though he claimed to be a Serbian patriot, explainingtheir action as follows:   "Inasmuch as you were a Serb, you sullied the Serb name, because you   are a Turk [i.e. Muslim].  And since you helped us, we shall not   torture you."so the shot him instead of cutting his throat.  In the past year, Serbshave repeated the slaughter of Muslim residents of Foca.  Destructionof mosques, including priceless historical monuments, completes theeradication of the Muslim presence from territories claimed by Serbs.>>I strongly dispute your notion that Croats had a similar older agenda,>>in fact, for the past century or two, Croats and Muslims have seen>>themselves as having a lot in common, and they generally had friendly>>relations.  Your suggestion that Croat-Muslim relationship is >>anything like Serb-Muslim relationship is completely wrong.>>>>To say that Croats and Muslims have a lot in common does not imply>>they are not separate peoples.  ....>>How touching.

However >one of the main agendas is turning Bosnia into purely Catholic state.Croatia never had many Muslim citizens for historical reasons, because itwas not a part of the Ottoman Empire.  The last major battles betweenAustro-Hungarian monarchy and the Ottoman Empire in Croatia were at theend of the 17th century.  Need I remind you that modern Croatian nationalismcame into being with Dr. Ante Starcevic, who saw Bosnian Muslims as thebest Croats, so much so that in 1853 he contemplated moving his operations to Sarajevo?  You are confusing clericalist Croatianism with Croatiannationalism here.   Political nationalism has always been stronger.  Asfor your other theories, you are clearly overjoyed that Croat-Muslimalliance in Bosnia-Herzegovina is now in trouble.  Arguments such asyours are clearly intended to create and deepen this split.  >I should add few more things.  A.J.

Balance of power thinking has brought together Croatsand Bosnian Muslims.  This is only natural; all other alignments areunstable.  I'm working on pointing out this basic fact: Croats andMuslims have been aware of it for as long as Serbia has existed.  You are wrong if you think only "image" is at stake here.  Croatia hasa deep interest in her alliance with Bosnian Muslims, and vice versa.  I think Tudjman understands this, although he does not have much choice at this point.  Tensions should have been defused better earlier, before any open confrontation developed.  Although I still think Croatia willsurvive, it will lose a lot; but Bosnian Muslims may end up even worseoff.  However, their position now is so horrible that perhaps they do notsee it getting any worse.  The key point is: do they still have any hope left?If not, then all bets are off.Mr. Stojanovic is clearly very, very happy about this.  I'm deeply hurt.This is not about some "image" but about survival of a concept of apartnership which I believe is natural and essential for both Croatsand Muslims.  Sigh...Josip

If Yugoslavia's borders could be changedagainst its will, then certainly Croatia's borders and B-H's borderscan be changed as well.  As I have stated many times: the civil war in ex-Yugoslavia will endwhen the terms of secession (borders, etc.) for Croatia and B-H arefinally agreed upon.  Serbs, Croats, and Muslims will *all* have tomake territorial concessions to reach such an agreement.  -Nick

Israel's #1 issue is "Security" so *any* outcomesof "negotiation" certainly need to address ISREAL'S perception of thisissue.The problem is is defining (by "outsiders", by Israel, and by the Arabsthemselves) what is the #1 issue to the Arab side.

Just asthe dividing line between Israel-fighting-for-security and Israel-fighting-to-expand is often hard to discern by "outsiders" (especially to the Arab world), so the rationale behind the Arab-struggle-to-undermine-Israel-in-any-way could either be based on visceral rejectionism or a sense of beingwronged that still values peace, who knows which.

(Sahak Melkonian - 1920 - "Preserving the Armenian purity") During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920, the Armenian Dictatorship through a premeditated and systematic genocide, tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their 1,000 year homeland.The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instanceof Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.This event is incontrovertibly proven by historians, governmentand international political leaders, such as U.S. Ambassador Mark Bristol, William Langer, Ambassador Layard, James Barton, Stanford Shaw, Arthur Chester, John Dewey, Robert Dunn, Papazian, Nalbandian, Ohanus Appressian, Jorge Blanco Villalta, General Nikolayef, General Bolkovitinof, General Prjevalski, General Odiselidze, Meguerditche, Kazimir, Motayef, Twerdokhlebof, General Hamelin, Rawlinson, AvetisAharonian, Dr. Stephan Eshnanie, Varandian, General Bronsart, Arfa,Dr. Hamlin, Boghos Nubar, Sarkis Atamian, Katchaznouni, Rachel Bortnick, Halide Edip, McCarthy, W.

Igor and I had thought that if it was a girl we would call her Raisa, after my mother-in-law, and if it was a boy, we'd call him Arsen, after Igor's grandfather. I had a girl, and I, withoutIgor, named her Raisa, in honor of her dead grandmother.Our family and the Melkumians had been neighbors since 1965. Igor and I grew up together, we were friends from childhood on. We got engaged when I was 16. In 1981, when I was 18, we were married. Two children were born to us in Sumgait. My daughter is now 6 years old, her name is Kristina, and my son,Seryozha, is four and a half.First I shall tell what happened on February 27. That day on my way home from work I passed Lenin Square, where about 1,500 people had gathered. There were Komsomol members there, and Pioneers [Children's organization], and there were both Party members and non-Party people there as well. All of them were shouting, "There's no room for Christians here!" and "When we finish with the Armenians, we'll go after the Russians!" And some even cried Out, "Death to the Armenians!" Absurd rumors had been circulating about town. I became frightened. I came home, breathless, and told about everything I had seen downtown. My family couldn't believe it. My father-in-law Sogomon Markovich Melkumian, wasn't home, he was at an Azerbaijani wedding. By eight o'clock he returned and had barely finished parking the car when his rear window was smashed with a rock. He got out of the car but there was no one there. Well I was telling him everything, too, and he said, "What, is there no longer anygovernment?" That same day Igor said, "Papa, something terrible is happening in the city." And he said, "We'll stay at home, no one will drive us from our own home."The day passed. On February 28, that was Sunday, we didn't go out. We called our relatives and asked them all kinds of questions, and they all said the same thing. Sometime around evening they started smashing the car of an Armenian from the neighboring building. Ira, my brother-in-law's wife, and I called the police: they're wrecking a car, help. We called and called, and nonetheless they didn't come and they didn't do anything.On February 29, on Monday, even though there were troops in the city, we were afraid to go to work. I called the school: I had the keys to the classroom. I told the senior teacher that he should send someone for the keys, I wouldn't be coming in. He agreed, and even said, "Fine, don't come in, we understand what's going on in town, don't come in."Before that, on the 28th, the Ambartsumian family came over. They came to my father-in-law and said, "Uncle Sergey, they broke our windows, bad things are happening in town." Uncle Misha Ambartsumian even said, "With my own eyes I saw them chasing naked girls through the streets. I don't know," he said, "we should leave town." Well on the 29th we were already trying to decide where we should go, thinking we'd go to our dacha. We got a couple of bags together, clothes, food, the bare essentials. And then somewhere around 4:45 the building manager came by and said, "Uncle Sergey, the situation in town is bad, don't go out." My father even opened up to him and said, "Maybe we'll drive to the dacha, it'll be safer there." "No," he said, "it'll be worse there, you'll be safer at home." He said don't be afraid, if something happens I'll send people to save you.After he left about 15 minutes passed and about 200 people burst into our courtyard. All of us were at home at the time: Igor and I and our two children, Ira and Edik and their daughter, my sister-in-law Ira, and my mother-and father-in-law. And the Ambartsumian family, there were three of them, Uncle Misha, Zhasmen, and their daughter Marina. Now when they startedbreaking down the door I remember Edik and Igor told us, "Go in that roomand close the door. Close the door and calm the children so they won't hearthat there's anyone home." The children started crying. Suddenly Ira, my brother-in-law's wife, suggested, "Let's run out onto the balcony." We -- thetwo daughters-in-law and the children, and Zhasmen and Marina -- raced outonto the balcony. My sister-in-law and my mother-in-law ran in and said, "Quick, over to the other balcony, or they'll kill you all." We lived on thesecond floor. We needed to cross over from our balcony to our neighbor's. Atfirst we couldn't manage it. The balcony looked onto the street. At that timepeople were coming home from work, and many just stood there, watching. I pleaded and begged: "Please, call someone, have someone come!" I even started shouting. "I'll throw down the children, I'll throw them down, you catch them and take them somewhere, so at least the children will survive." Either they were afraid or . . . I don't know what. They looked as though they were watching a movie. Some of them started throwing stones at us. I'll say it again, these weren't the bandits, these were people from the other part of the building and from our entryway, they were just regular people, passersby. A bus even stopped. I remember a man's voice saying the Armenians were climbingover to the other balcony. Ira, my sister-in-law, helped us get the children over there. I was pregnant, about seven months pregnant. No, it wasn't yet seven, it was six and a half. I climbed over too. I think Zhasmen went first; you know, I just don't remember it all that well. Zhasmen went first, I think, and Edik's wife Ira and I had the children, and they were all screaming and crying. My Kristina said, "Mamma, don't throw us over the balcony, we're afraid!" Lilia was crying, and Kristina and Seryozha were crying too. Kristina didn't even want to climb over. She shouted, "I'm staying with Grandmother,I'm staying with Grandma!" She loved her grandma, more than she loved me. And my mother-in-law shouted, "Oh no, Kristina's still there, she's still there, save Kristina, too!" Ira helped us climb over, with Kristina coming last. Ira helped us and went back inside.We started pounding on the neighbor's balcony door. I pounded with my fist, Sevil, open the door, open it, please!" She didn't open it. "No, go away, go anywhere, go, I'm not opening the door." She was our neighbor, we were friends, we never refused her anything, ever! And apparently she thought we were going to break the windows, and she opened the door. She opened it and said, "Karina, Karina, go away, go anywhere, just don't stay here, they'll kill us, too, because of you." I begged, "Please, at least take the children, we'll leave, we'll go back." "No," she said, "you have to leave." Her sons ran in, one had a knife. Sevil's brother, he's around 18, shouted at us: "Get out of here, leave, I'll kill you with this knife!" I became terrified, I took the children and went out in the entryway and went down a few stairs. I went down and heard a loudspeaker. It was in the courtyard "The Armenians must be killed, they've taken all the best places, all the best apartments!" One of them said, "Let the Armenian blood flow, none of them should survive!" When I heard that I went upstairs and started knocking on doors. No one opened their door for me! Not on the third floor, or the fourth. I couldn't see Zhasmen any longer. Ira came upstairs later. I even thought that they had let her stay, that they would save her.My head was spinning. They were killing my family, and here I was in the next entryway with two children. Seryozha was four, and Kristina was five and a half. They were crying, "Mamma, we're scared!" They were so frightened that I didn't even know how to calm them, should I try to calm them or myself? It was awful. But on the third floor a man did open his door. I asked, "Open up, let me inside!" He opened the door slightly and said, "No!" "No" and that was it! He said it so sternly: "No!" I went up to the fifth floor. I pounded my fists on the door with all my might. He opened up, the man of the house, and stood there, looking at me. I was ready to get down on my knees. I almost did get down on my knees. "Please, I beg of you, at least take the children." He wasn't an Azerbaijani, he was a Lezgin. I don't even know how, but he let me inside. And when I went in, Zhasmen was already there. Two minutes hadn't passed when Ira and Lilia came up the stairs. Lilia was crying. He didn't want to open the door. And again I started pleading, "Please, open the door, it's our Ira and Lilia! Open the door!" And he said, "No, I'm afraid." I said again and again, "Please, open the door, please!" He looked at me. He looked at me for a long time and then opened the door after all. Ira came in with Lilia. We threw ourselves into each other's arms, crying. Then the man locked us into the bathroom. We sat there for a long time. Through the door he told us, "Calm the children, and calm yourselves down, too."Calm down? This man was hiding us, but what of our family? When I was still in our apartment I had sensed that none of us would come out of this alive. I said, "Igor, Edik, let's say farewell." And Edik turned around and looked at me as if to say, is that some kind of joke? All the same I thought they would kill all of us. Igor looked at me, too . . . But it was already too late! They started pounding on the door, Igor was standing next to the door. Before that he had told us, "Go lock yourselves in that room and sit tight." He thought we were in the room. But before we went out onto the balcony we went to them: "Edik, Igor, let's say farewell." Igor didn't think we could climb over to the other balcony. And we did get over there, and I myself can't believe we were able to save ourselves.Igor put on a helmet, and Edik had his coat on, and he put on a fur hat. All the men--Igor, Edik, their father, and Misha Ambartsumian--they all stood next to the door. They thought they would pound on it a while and leave. But from the other side of the door they ordered in Azerbaijani: "Open the door!" We were all silent, waiting. Someone outside the door said, "They're home,they're in there, break down the door!" And I remember my father-in-law whispering, "They're going to break it down now, it's coming down now . . . "He had something in his hands, I think it was a knife: if they got in, we were going to defend ourselves. In the hall near the door there were two metal chair legs. From outside the door they said, "We're counting to five, open up!" But we were all quiet, we didn't answer them. We made like no one was home. We figured they'd leave, they'd get tired and leave. My father-in-law had said, "It's not possible they'd come into my home. How can that be? Everyone knows us, all of Sumgait knows our family, we are on good terms with everyone." And indeed a day did not pass that there wasn't an Azerbaijani guest at our table. We had a nice dacha, everyone would get together there often, Azerbaijanis liked being with us there too. But now we had to save ourselves, we had to flee from our own home. Ira, I remember, said, "I'm not leaving here, my brothers and my parents are here, I'm going to fight alongside them." That's just what she said. She picked up a knife and said, "If they open the door and come into the apartment then I'm going to fight alongside my family, I'm not going anywhere."We were at Sevil's when they broke into our apartment. We heard fighting and shouting. The noise was terrible. And when we hid upstairs on the fifth floor at the Lezgin's apartment, you could hear everything up there, too. Even Ira's voice. I remember her calling her mother several times. She called her for a long time . . . I started pounding on the door in the bathroom: "Open the door, what are they doing to Ira, who's shouting, that's Ira shouting, that's her voice!" But the Lezgin said, "It's nothing, calm down, no, it's not in your apartment." He was lying to me so I'd calm down. Two hours went by and the Lezgin opened the door and said, "Karina, Igor got away, calm down. He ran away." He saw Igor break away and run off with his own eyes. They killed him outside, next to the building.While we were in the bathroom I experienced every possible human terror. The way Ira shouted! She shouted, "Save me, Mamma, save me! . . . Mamma, Mamma!" She repeated it several times. There was a wild din. There were very many people there, all of them shouting, all of them bellowing, howling, whistling--you just can't imagine what was going on, what the roar was like.Apparently, after they had killed Ira those murderers came into the entryway where we were hiding and came upstairs, all the way up to the fifth floor. I don't know if they were just looking for any Armenians or for us inparticular, but I think they were looking for us because when we had climbed over the balconies someone on the street was saying that the daughters-in-law were climbing over the balconies. And after we heard Ira we heard them coming up the stairs in the entryway and hammering on the doors. I thought those were our last moments, and started saying good-bye to my children, kissing them. They were sleeping. I woke them up: "Kristina! Seryozha, wake up!" And I tell Ira: "Ira, if something happens, we'll throw ourselves off the balcony." We were on the fifth floor. Apparently our Lezgin neighbor had opened the door too, because later he said, "I opened the door and told them there were no Armenians inside." And after they all left our neighbor went out on the balcony himself to see: they were gone.We weren't friends with those Lezgin neighbors, we only knew each other from the building. But the people we were friends with wouldn't even consider hiding us.The Lezgin let us out of the bathroom. They had a candle burning. He said, "Karina, there're no lights on in our block." The whole block was dark, the whole block! It's a huge block, too. The Lezgin said, "I'm afraid to keepyou until morning, I'm afraid of the neighbors, they might kill me for savingyou." I said, "What are you saying, we'll leave now. But we can't just leavewith the children in the middle of the night. Give us time to find somewhereelse to hide." He said, "Well OK, go look." I asked Ira, "Ira, do you want togo?" Ira said, "No, I'll stay with the children, Karina." I said, "Fine, thenI'll go." Zhasmen and I went downstairs together. It was very dark. No one was in the courtyard. It was dark, pitch black. l was afraid to go out at after seven, Igor always met me after work and accompanied me home, I never went out alone. And now here I was out in the middle of the night and after aslaughter like that, too. It was probably after eleven. Later I called the boarding school and my director answered. He said, "Karina, where are you?" Ididn't know, I was calling from a public phone outside and didn't know where I was. I got confused and hung up the receiver. From him I only found out what time it was, I asked him, "What time is it?" He said 11:20, I think, but I don't really remember. So anyway Zhasmen and I went out into the courtyard. I look and see what appears to be a person not far from our apartment. And therewas the smell of something burnt. I became horrified. I looked at the corpse for a long time. It was either Ira or Edik. I only saw one of them, Zhasmen grabbed my hand and squeezed it: "Hurry up, let's go . . . Hurry up, come on, what are you turning around for?" I turned around and saw a large truck, it must have belonged to the bandits, because they came to kill us in a truck like that. We lived in the third entryway, and that truck was next to the fourth. We walked quickly, holding hands. I thought, if I go to the police then they'll put me away. I couldn't count on them. Before I reached the police station I saw a military vehicle. We went over and I said, "Soldier, in Block 41, I don't know if they've killed people or injured them--we need to save them!" And he said, "Go to the police station and tell them everything." I said, "I'm afraid to go there, I'm afraid of them." He said, "Don't be afraid."We went to the police and they wrote down the address, and the military vehicle went to our building. I didn't go with them, they left me at the police station. I gave the addresses of my mother and my brothers so that they'd rescue them, too. I didn't know where they were or what had happened tothem.After a while they brought my children and Ira and Lilia. First they took us to the KGB, that was at two or three in the morning. Then around five they took us to the City Party Committee, and there were very many people there, very many. I was pregnant and was wearing nothing but a dress. Seryozha was only wearing a shirt, and Kristina had a little dress on. No coat, no boots, nothing! And we sat there for three whole days in the City Party Committee.The Lezgin had told me that Igor escaped. And I thought that he was probably alive. But then after two and a half days, they took us, the Armenians of Sumgait, to Nasosny. On March 6 some people from the Central Committee came and told us, "Karina, Ira, we need you, come with us to the City Party Committee." My Mamma had come to Nasosny, and she had been looking for me for six days. Mama, my brothers, and my uncle. We went to the City Party Committee and waited there in the courtyard. I was wearing nothing but a dress, and Ira had only a dress on as well. There was a strong wind on March 6. An hour went by. And then one of the functionaries told us, "Karina, Ira, gather your courage. Would you like to go to the burial?" I said, "What, did they really kill all of them?!" He said, "Let's look." He had a long list, and he started reading them off: Igor Melkumian, my husband, Eduard Melkumian, my brother-in-law, Irina Melkumian, my sister-in-law, Sogomon Melkumian, my father-in-law,and Raisa Melkumian, my mother-in-law. He read off all their names and said, "Get in the car, let's go to the burial."We buried our family. I couldn't believe it at the time, I couldn't conceiveof it or imagine it . . . And even now I think how shall I explain it to my children when they're older?My children were very attached to their father and their grandfather andgrandmother. Kristina didn't love me the way she loved her grandfather andgrandmother, they spoiled her. Kristina would always announce, "My grandma is better than anyone!" Now, even though she is getting used to my mother, it's difficult for her, and once she told her: "You're a bad grandmother."I don't know why, I asked her, "Kristina, where's Papa?" and she said, "They killed him." She knows, she understands it all. And recently I scoldedSeryozha severely for something, and he started shouting at me, "When Papa comes I'm going to tell him everything!"July 26, 1988Nairi Boarding HouseNear the Village of ArzakanHrazdan DistrictArmenian SSR- - - reference - - -[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

Oh great.  Today's headlines tell us that the Croatians and Bosnians are fighting  each other throughout central Bosnia, in battles that the UN describes  as "out of control" and atrocities being reported from both sides.  These people are crazy.  Right now the Serbians are Number One in violations of human rights  and general carnage but crazed violence in the Balkans is like the  car-rental business - if you're Number Two you just try harder.  The region doesn't need military aid; it needs psychiatric help!  We should bomb them with Thorazine and then air-drop several   regiments of psychotherapists.  There is no justification for US military involvement because there  is no reasonable, definable goal we can achieve militarily.  Sure,  if send in several divisions of mechanized infantry we can probably  stop the more egregious fighting; but only as long as we are willing  to stay in there and play policeman and get shot at.  The minute we   leave or turn our backs they'll be at each other's throats again.                                  BTW, with Bosnia's large Moslem population, why have nations like   Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Egypt, and others with either money   or strong military forces not spoken out more forcibly or offered   to help out Bosnia?   The Turkish ambassador has ocassionally said  a thing or two, but that's all; I see no great enthusism from any   of those places to get *their* hands dirty.    Why does the US always  get stuck with this stuff?  Besides, there's no case that can be made for US military involvement  there that doesn't apply equally well to, say, Liberia, Angola, or  (it appears with the Khmer Rouge's new campaign) Cambodia.

The question of  responsibility for the massacres or deportation of nearly all Ottoman  Armenians has evolved into a polemic. Hundreds of books, articles, and  documents have been published to describe the horrifying scenes of violence  and death. Many writers, such as the British Bryce and Toynbee, French Pinon,  German Lepsius, American Morganthau and Gibbons, have insisted that the  massacres were predetermined and ruthlessly executed. The have refuted the  Ottoman government's official publications and justifications by  substantiating that anti-Armenian measures were deliberated by the   Ittihadists even before the outbreak of war. The fact remains than an   estimated eight hundred thousand to over a million Armenians perished within  a few months, and several hundred thousand more succumbed in the following  years to the ravages of disease, famine, and refugee life. Unknown numbers  of women and children were converted forcibly to Islam, possessed by  Turkish men, or adopted by Moslem families."[(*][4] Shaw, S.

For example:Experts from an interview (in Greek) with Professor Spyros Vryonis (from NYC'sNational Herald, 3/12/93) [Thanks, Mr. G.B.] "Few people know of the problem I faced at UCLA when Professor Stanford  Shaw was due for promotion. I knew him to be Turkey's man; due to my  reading knowledge of Turkish and my seniority over him, I was a member  of the promotion committee. For that case, I sat down and read his entire  treatise "History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey". It took me  three months and I found out, from volume I, that he had plagiarized   Uzun Jarsoglu, an eminent Turkish specialist on Ottoman history. Shaw  himself claimed in his introduction that his treatise was the outcome   of a 20-year search through the Ottoman Archives. Well, I went on leave    and managed to show 40% of Volume I, containing around 5000 sentences,   to be the result of plagiarism, matching each sentence with passages      from the original work. He had even reproduced the errors. So I produced a  500-pages manuscript and submitted a 60-pages report on Shaw's plagiarism.   The University, however, rejected my report and, after a closed meeting,  promoted Stanford Shaw to Distinguished Professor. I paid a price for   all this: upset by the whole process, I confronted the entire University  structure and was considered to be a chauvinist and madman. I asked for  permission to run a seminar on Shaw's book that was denied by the President  of the University. While the Center for Near Eastern Studies granted me  permission, the President was depriving me of my academic freedom. Luckily,  the Dean refused to give in and I did run the seminar, attended by more   than 150 academic people, in which I uncovered Stanford Shaw, who refused  to attend. As a punishment, the University froze all my raises."[5] "Gochnak" (Armenian newspaper published in the United States), May 24,               1915.No chance!

They are Pomaks and Gypsies.Oboy, this is exciting. First you discuss your non-existent literaturetastes, then your fantasies, and now your choices of historical revisionism.Are you related to 'Arromdians' of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism andRevisionism Triangle?The Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,' which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference to 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the existence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the essential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger Turkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the three nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of themselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized according to the agreements? It also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece and the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.The Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkishminority. They pursue the same denial in connection with the Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition,in 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091,virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar andother charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supportingreligious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek governments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespectiveof the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Althoughthe Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters inGreece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electingits religious leaders. Talk about democracy.The government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic convention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called' Greek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection of historical monuments. The government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward Hellenizing the region.The longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish' in titlesand on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts haveordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association, the Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti Turkish Association on grounds that there are no Turksin Western Thrace. Such community associations had been active until 1984. But they were first told to removethe word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their officialpapers and then eventually close down. This is also the final verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.Helsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating the plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their findings were published in a report titled  'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.'The report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the Turkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance, the Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the Lausanne Convention. |1|HELSINKI WATCH: "PROBLEMS OF TURKS IN WESTERN THRACE CONTINUE"Ankara (A.A)  In a 15-page report  of the "Helsinki Watch"  it isstated that the Turkish minority in Western Thrace is still facedwith problems and stipulated that the discriminatory policy beingimplemented by the Greek Government be brought to an end.The report on Western Thrace emphasized that the Greek governmentshould grant  social and political  rights to all the  members ofminorities that are equal to  those enjoyed by Greek citizens andin addition  they must  recognize the  existence of  the "TurkishMinority" in Western Thrace and  grant them the right to identifythemselves as 'Turks'.NEWSPOT, May 1992|2|GREECE ISOLATES WEST THRACE TURKSThe  Xanthi independent  MP Ahmet  Faikoglu said  that the  Greekstate is trying to cut all  contacts and relations of the Turkishminority with Turkey.Pointing out that while the  Greek minority living in Istanbul iscalled "Greek"  by ethnic  definition, only  the religion  of theminority in  Western Thrace is  considered. In an  interview withthe Greek  newspaper "Ethnos" he said:  "I am a Greek  citizen ofTurkish origin. The individuals of the minority living in WesternTrace are also Turkish."Emphasizing  the education  problem for  the Turkish  minority inWestern  Thrace  Faikoglu said  that  according  to an  agreementsigned in 1951 Greece must distribute textbooks printed in Turkeyin Turkish minority schools in Western Thrace.Recalling his activities and those of Komotini independent MP Dr.SadIk  Ahmet  to  defend  the rights  of  the  Turkish  minority,Faikoglu said.  "In fact we  helped Greece. Because  we preventedGreece, the cradle of democracy, from losing face before Europeancountries by forcing the Greek  government to recognize our legalrights."On Turco-Greek relations, he pointed  out that both countries arepredestined  to live  in  peace for  geographical and  historicalreasons and said  that Turkey and Greece must  resist the foreignpowers  who  are  trying  to   create  a  rift  between  them  bycooperating, adding  that in  Turkey he  observed that  there waswill to improve relations with Greece.NEWSPOT, January 1993|3|MACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE.Two ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial inAthens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to aCourt Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS.  Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis)have been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments inan Athenian magazine.  Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weeklymagazine  "ENA"  on  March  11,  1992,  and  said  that  they  asMacedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and wouldfield  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greekgeneral election.  Bulev said in the interview: "I am not Greek, I am Macedonian."Sideropoulos said  in the  article that "Greece  should recogniseMacedonia.  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirationsagainst  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  theborder, at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EECare falling."  The  main  charge  against  the two,  according  to  the  courtsummons,  was   that  "they  have   spread...intentionally  falseinformation  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  thecitizens,  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  theinternational interests of the country (Greece)."  The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  aMacedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to1,000,000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece,  largelyconcentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek stateif anyone declares themselves Macedonian.  In  1913  Greece,   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partionedMacedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonianvillages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5million Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000in Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.  Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonianhuman rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker afew years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island inthe mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forcedthe Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town ofFlorina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where themajority of ethnic Macedonians live.  Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial inwhich  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent,especially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for itsnorthern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.  Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemnedGreece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (wholargely live in Western Thrace).

Biden's statement were quoted by the Washington Post today:   Let me put it plainly, Mr. Secretary.  You are required to speak   diplomatically; I am not.  I cannot even begin to express to you   my contempt for a European policy that is now asking us to    participate in what amounts to a codification of the Serbian victory.   ...   What you have encountered is a discouraging mosaic of indifference,   timidity, self-delusion and hypocrisy.   ...   After they held our coats on Kuwait and Somalia, they are asking us   to put in a few thousand troops on the ground in order to have the   right to speak and in order to implement their new idea of 'safe   havens' for the Bosnians...   Let's not mince words.  European policy is based on cultural and   religious indifference, if not bigotry.  And I think it's fair to say   that this would be an entirely different situation if the Muslims   were doing what the Serbs have done, if this was Muslim aggression   instead of Serbian aggression.Too bad the Washington Post did not include his next sentence, which pointed out that a consequence of such policy is a rising angerwithin the Islamic world, the consequences of which we cannot beginto predict.  Later, Biden told a reporter why he spoke out:   I think someone has to respond to Europe to make it clear   this is a big deal... so they will understand.and it IS a big deal.  By refusing the fundamental human right ofself-defense to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Europe and the world have aided the Serbian aggression.  Moreover, the arms embargo hasforced a situation in which Bosnian Serbs have 10 times more heavyweaponry than Bosnian Croats and Muslims combined.  Under suchconditions, it is very easy for Serbs to play a "divide-and-conquer"game, and to get the Muslims and Croats (who have strong commoninterests and who were allied against the Serbian aggression) to start fighting each other, which leads to their mutual catastrophe.One final quote:  U.S. Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, hassaid in Rome last week that "In practice, the embargo had the oppositeeffect intended.  It made aggression certain."All diplomats who deluded themselves that they could negotiate peacewhile enforcing a 10:1 imbalance of power on the ground have contributedto this tragedy.Sincerely,-Josip

It isspeach that some find questionable that must be protected, beit religiously blasphemous or inherently racist. It is onlythrough civilized discourse and not scare tactics that one canenlighten those that one perceives to be ignorant. That is theidea behind freedom of expression.What you find offensive might be perceived as truth bysome and what they might find offensive might be your belief.It is only through free exchange of ideas (and insults as thecase seems to be with this channel) that one can changeanother's erring ways.That is why Jefferson said that here we are not afraid to "tolerate error so long as reason is left to combat it".

 8504/16/93 1045  ARMENIA SAYS IT COULD SHOOT DOWN TURKISH PLANESBy David LjunggrenMOSCOW, April 16, Reuter - Armenia accused Turkey on Friday of flying weaponsx and troops across Armenian airspace to Azerbaijan and strongly hinted itmight try to shoot the planes down, local journalists in Yerevan said.Separately, Itar-Tass news agency said Armenian forces had halted their latestoffensive which has swallowed up one-tenth of Azerbaijan and sent tensions inthe Transcaucasian region soaring.The journalists in the Armenian capital quoted Armen Duliyan, head of theArmenian defence ministry press centre, as saying Ankara had been sending planes up to 15 times a day to Azerbaijan with arms and troops.It looks as though the Armenian leadership will have to warn Turkey aboutthe impermissibility of such actions," the journalists quoted Duliyan as saying."If such steps are pursued in the future we will have recourse to appropriatemeasures. We have all the necessary means, including modern anti-aircraftunits."Turkey, which shares a border with Armenia, has supported Azerbaijan in theconflict over the mainly Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh region in whichmore than 2,500 people have been killed since fighting erupted in 1988.The Turkish foreign ministry said on Friday it had so far sent one plane toAzerbaijan containing humanitarian aid.A Turkish foreign ministry spokesman on Thursday would not comment directlyon a report by Hurriyet newspaper that a first consignment of rockets, rocketlaunchers, ammunition and light weapons had arrived in Azerbaijan from Turkey.Duliyan said Turkey had been sending up to 30 trucks a day carrying troopsand arms to the bordering Azeri autonomous territory of Nakhichevan, from wherethey were flown across Armenian airspace to the Azeri capital Baku."All the responsibility for possible consequences will be borne by thecountry which is affording military assistance over our airspace," he said.Armenia denies any formal role in the conflict, saying that the troops involved in the fighting are from the enclave itself.Tass said the Karabakh forces decided on Friday to suspend their offensivealong the entire Armenian-Azerbaijani front."The Karabakh authorities are reportedly ready to give independentinspectors a chance to see for themselves on the spot that the (enclave's)leadership is striving to achieve a ceasefire," the agency said.Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan called for a two-stage ceasefire inKarabakh when he arrived in the Belarus capital Minsk on Friday for a summit ofCommonwealth leaders."The first stage of the settlement should involve a ceasefire and securing theprotection of the Karabakh population," Tass quoted him as saying.     At least 10 ceasefires have been brokered in the conflict but all havecollapsed."The second stage should involve discussing and finding a solution to thelegal issues: that is, a clarification of the status of Nagorno-Karabakh," hesaid. The republic declared full independence last year but the move has not been recognised by any other country.Armenia insists that a separate Karabakh delegation should take part in futurepeace talks, something Azerbaijan rejects.Local news agencies in Baku said on Friday that Interior Minister IskenderGamidov, a fiery nationalist and hardliner in the territorial dispute withArmenia, had resigned.Turan news agency said he quit on Thursday and had cleared his office.Khabar-Servis agency said he would be replaced by the military commandant ofBaku, police Major-General Abdullah Allakhverdiyev.

 18It seems that, to keep the peace talks going, Israel has to keepmaking goodwill gesture after goodwill gesture, while PalestinianArabs continue to go around hunting Jews.If the peace talks are going to have any realistic chance of success,the Arabs are going to have to start reciprocating, especially sincethey are the ones who will be getting tangible concessions in returnfor giving up only intangibles.  If they keep trying to change thealready agreed upon rules, which seems to be one of their favoritegames, the Israelis are not likely to be very confident that theintangibles they will receive at the bargaining table will be worththe parchment they're written on.It takes two to negotiate a peace.  It's time for the Arabs to startdoing their share.-- Alan H. Stein                     astein@israel.nysernet.org

Secondly, surely israeli have human rights, but they ask their goverment to   protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories, not by further oppressing   Palestinean human rights.I'm sorry, but the above sentence does not make sense. Please rephrase it.   |> If a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions, then    |> tell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all?   Because not all states are like Israel, as oppressive, as ignorant, or as tyrant.Oh, ok. So how about the human rights of the Syrians, Iraqis and others?Does the name of Hama sound familiar? Or how about the kurds in Iraq andTurkey? How about the Same in Sweden (Ok, maybe a bit farfetched..) the Russians inthe Baltic states or the Moslem in the old USSR and Yugoslavia?Do the serbs have any human rights remainaing, according to you?   |>    |> And which system do you propose we use to solve the ME problem?   |>    |>    The question is NOT which system would solve the ME problem.

So you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights.   (i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph).No, I'm agreeing that to just kick all the Palestinians out of Israel proper would probably lead to disaster for both parties. If that's what you refer to as the 'Israeli solution' then so be it.   |>    Joseph Weitz (administrator responsible for Jewish colonization)    |>    said it best when writing in his diary in 1940:   |>    "Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both   |>    peoples together in this country....

According to the report, Israel isexpected to offer the Palestinians new proposals regarding theauthority of the Palestinian Executive Council, general elections,control over land and human rights issues in the Territories.Israel will express its readiness to give the Palestinians controlof more land than previously offered. According to the radioreport, one estimate is that Israel will give the Palestinianscontrol over as much as two thirds of the administered lands, aswell as broad authority on water issues. Israel will seek topromote its offer to hold elections in the Territories in hopes ofstrengthening the position of the Palestinian delegation to thepeace negotiations. According to Israel Radio, the Israelidelegation to the bilateral talks with the Palestinians will offergreater responsibilities to the Palestinian Executive Councilallowing it certain legislative capabilities, without making it asymbol for Palestinian sovereignty. U.S. Secretary of State WarrenChristopher invited all the heads of delegations to a gatheringtonight. It will be the first such event since the Madridconference. Head of the American team at the bilateral peace talks,Edward Djerejian, said that tonight's gathering is meant todemonstrate the U.S.' active role in the peace process. ---Naftaly Stramer  | Intergraph ElectronicsInternet: nstramer@dazixco.ingr.com      | 6101 Lookout Road, Suite A    Voice: (303)581-2370  FAX: (303)581-9972 | Boulder, CO 80301"Quality is everybody's job, and it's everybody's job to watch all that they can."

Since I read both American mediaand Israeli media, I can say with absolute certainty that anybodywho reliesx exclusively on the American press for knowledge aboutIsrael does not have a true picture of what is going on.   As to the claim that Israeli papers are biased, of course theyare.  Some may lean to the right or the left, just like the mediahere in America.

Still covering up the crimes of your fascist Armenian grandparents and Nazi Armenian parents? Not a chance. As early as 1934, K. S. Papazian asserted in 'Patriotism Perverted' that the Armenians        'lean toward Fascism and Hitlerism.'[1]At that time, he could not have foreseen that the Armenians wouldactively assume a pro-German stance and even collaborate in WorldWar II. His book was dealing with the Armenian genocide of the Muslimpopulation of Eastern Anatolia. However, extreme rightwing ideologicaltendencies could be observed within the Dashnagtzoutune long beforethe outbreak of the Second World War.In 1936, for example, O. Zarmooni of the 'Tzeghagrons' was quotedin the 'Hairenik Weekly:' "The race is force: it is treasure. If we follow history we shall  see that races, due to their innate force, have created the nations and these have been secure only insofar as they have reverted to the race after becoming a nation. Today Germany and Italy are strong because as nations they live and breath in terms of race. On the other hand, Russia is comparatively weak because she is bereft of social sanctities."[2][1] K. S. Papazian, 'Patriotism Perverted,' (Boston, Baikar Press   1934), Preface.[2] 'Hairenik Weekly,' Friday, April 10, 1936, 'The Race is our   Refuge' by O. Zarmooni.In April 1942, Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus.A number of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to Germanofficials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren BegzadianPaikhar, son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku.Paikhar wrote a letter to Hitler, asking for German support to hisArmenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting thecreation of an Armenian SS formation in order "to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the  spirit of the Nazi ideas."He wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territoriesof the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkishhomeland. Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in GoebbelsPropaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian- and French-languageradio broadcastings.[1] The Armenian-language broadcastings wereproduced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth.[2][1] Patrick von zur Muhlen (Muehlen), p. 106.[2] Enno Meyer, A. J. Berkian, 'Zwischen Rhein und Arax, 900    Jahre Deutsch-Armenische beziehungen,' (Heinz Holzberg    Verlag-Oldenburg 1988), pp. 124 and 129.The establishment of Armenian units in the German army was favoredby General Dro (the Butcher). He played an important role in theestablishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any official position. His views were represented by his men in therespective organs. An interesting meeting took place between Droand Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942.Dro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and aftera long conversation, asked if he could visit POW camp close toBerlin. Himmler provided Dro with his private car.[1] A minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy.As such, they were subject to German racism. However, Armenianswere the least threatened and indeed most privileged. In August 1933, Armenians had been recognized as Aryans by the Bureau ofRacial Investigation in the Ministry for Domestic Affairs.[1] Meyer, Berkian, ibid., pp. 112-113.Need I go on?Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

 145         The Orders for the Turkish Extermination of the Armenians #17    To the children of genocide: "Send them away into the Desert"This is part of a continuing series of articles containing official Turkish wartime (WW1) governmental telegrams, in translation, entailing the orders for the extermination of the Armenian people in Turkey. Generally, thesetelegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha,for example, we have the following set regarding children:"To the Government of Aleppo. November 5, 1915. We are informed that the little ones belonging to the Armenians from Sivas, Mamuret-ul-Aziz, Diarbekir and Erzeroum [hundreds of km distance from Aleppo] are adopted by certain Moslem families and received as servants when they are left alone through the death of their parents. We inform you that you are to collect all such children in your province and send them to the places of deportation, and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to the people.Minister of the Interior,Talaat" [1]"To the Government of Aleppo. September 21, 1915. There is no need for an orphanage. It is not the time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans, prolonging their lives. Send them away to the desert and inform us.Minister of the Interior,Talaat" [2]"To the General Committee for settling and deportees. November 26, 1915. There were more than four hundred children in the orphanage. They will be added to the caravans and sent to their places of exile. Abdullahad Nuri. [3]"To the Government of Aleppo. January 15, 1916. We hear that certain orphanages which have been opened receive also the children of the Armenians. Whether this is done through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contempt of it, the Government will regard the feeding of such children or any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it purpose, since it considers the survival of these children as detrimental. I recommend that such children shall not be received into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish special orphanages for them.Minister of the Interior,Talaat." [4]"To the Government of Aleppo. Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures to which their parents have been subjected. Send the rest away with the caravans.Minister of the Interior,Talaat" [5]"From the Ministry of the Interior to the Government of Aleppo. At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widows of Shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection, it is not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by Armenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble in the future. It is necessary that these children should be turned out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of deportation. Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent away, in compliance with our previous orders, to Sivas.Minister of the Interior,Talaat" [6]In 1926, Halide Edip (a pioneer Turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirsabout a conversation with Talaat Pasha, verifying and "rationalizing" thisultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality, the following:"I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks it moral. I am ready to die for what I have done, and I know I shall die for it." [7]These telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial ofTalaat Pasha's, assassin, Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government neverquestioned these "death march orders" until 1986, during a time when the worldwas again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians.For reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, theTurkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders wereever issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on astudy by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society.If one were to examine the sample "authentic text" provided in the Turkish Historical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it too would be a forgery!. In fact, if any of the tests delineated by the Turkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or Persian/Arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language isa forgery. Today, the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill, Istanbul,Turkey, just next to the Yildiz University campus.

 48Center for Policy Research <cpr@igc.apc.org> writes:Here you give positive, accurate "facts" about what happened to the beduinsand the land:   After the creation of the State of Israel, 80 percent of the Negev   Bedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan. The   10,000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of   40,000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150   mm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out   of three. The rare water wells in the south and central Negev,   spring of life in the desert, were cemented to prevent Bedouin   shepherds from roaming.   A few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev.   But after 1982, when the Sinai was returned to Egypt, these   Bedouin were also eliminated. At the same time, strong pressure   was applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields   in order that the land could be transferred to the army.And now you say noone knows anything about what happened there:   No reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held   today by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part of   the 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized   by the Israeli authorities. Indeed, most of the Bedouin are now   confined to seven "development towns", or *sowetos*, established   for them.   (the rest of the article is available from Elias Davidsson, email:   elias@ismennt.is)So what you basically say is that "we know for sure that nothing good happensthere now,  we know for sure that the beduins prospered before the Jews arrivedand that they were driven away by the Jews,  noone on earth knows aboutwhat the Jews did there."Is that what you said?  Could you proove any of the nonsense you wrote?BTW,  try asking beduins in Sinai how they mis the Israelis.  Not to mentionthat there are enough valotaring beduins in the IDF to have at least one fullbrigade of them.----Amos Shapira (Jumper Extraordinaire) |  "It is true that power corrupts,C.S.

I donot know why there are israeli voices against negotiations. However,i would guess that is because they refuse giving back a land for those whohave the right for it.As for the Arabian and Palestinean voices that are against thecurrent negotiations and the so-called peace process, theyare not against peace per se, but rather for their well-founded predictionsthat Israel would NOT give an inch of the West bank (and most probably the samefor Golan Heights) back to the Arabs. An 18 months of "negotiations" in Madrid,and Washington proved these predictions. Now many will jump on me saying whyare you blaming israelis for no-result negotiations.I would say why would the Arabs stall the negotiations, what do they have toloose ?Arabs feel that the current "negotiations" is ONLY for legitimizing the currentstatus-quo and for opening the doors of the Arab markets for israeli trade and"oranges".

But we do study and moreimportantly learn a lot. The overall UVa drug use is actuallylower than the average college in the U.S. There is no hate law on the books even though they (Theforces of PC) tried to have one last year( by the way a similarlaw at the University of Wisconsin ? was found unconstitutionallast year). There is a lawagainst relationship of professors with their students oradvisees that just passed.

You have set up straw horses and knocked them down. I'm not impressed.Anyway, the Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces,massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between 1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocentTurks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia today.Source: Stanford J. Shaw, on Armenian collaboration with invading Russianarmies in 1914, "History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey (VolumeII: Reform, Revolution & Republic: The Rise of Modern Turkey, 1808-1975)."(London, Cambridge University Press 1977). pp. 315-316."In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city  of Van, whose 33,789 Armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population,  closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire...Leaving Erivan  on April 28, 1915, Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized  and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during  the next two days while the small Ottoman garrison had to retreat to the southern side of the lake.""Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions, Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims. Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other invading Russian armies.

Machiavelli described the reasoning in thePrince. The clear intention was to create a constituency which the Likudbeleived could not be deprived of the land stolen from the indigenouspopulation.The pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the redefinition of much land used in common as "public land". The assertionthat the village common on which the village depends for food belongs toan invader simply because no individual has title is clearly anexcuse. When the land is used to build a condominium for aliens broughtin to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of theGeneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territoriesmust not be changed. No amount of self justifying on the part of Likud and hard linner appologistswill change the fact that the majority of world governments, and all ofthose that actually have any power have condemned this practice.|>The government had a number of reasons for encouraging people|>to move across the green line.

Since thePalestinians will remain heavily dependent on Israel indefinitely itis this that will be the guarantor of peace. another factor will be thereturn of lands confiscated by the Israeli state within Israel and thedismantling of the shadow structures which allow discrimination againstnon-Jews within what is nominaly a secular state. The irony is that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state hasa non descrimination law in order to protect the remaining settlers theIsraeli state is going to be forced inot the same position.

Arabs have afull voice in Israeli politics, to the degree that they choose toget involved.  They may vote.  There are Arabs in the Cabinet.     The claim that Israel is an apartheid state is a racist claim,one which is based on a total disregard for the facts and a totalhatred for Israel.

 24Let me remind all of those Muslim-haters out there who like tomention the Mufti's cooperation with Germany as a reason to let Muslimsbe slaughtered everywhere in the world of the following facts:1)Why blame the Muslims for what the Nazis did and FORGIVE ITALY, THE CROATS,AND MANY OTHER EUROPEANS FOR BEING REAL ALLIES TO HITLER?2)Why blame Muslims for supporting Germany the enemy of their enemyat the time (Britain who colonized most of the middle east and was responsiblefor most atrocities against Muslims in the region) and FORGIVE GERMANY ITSELFEVENTHOUGH IT IS THE ONE WHO CREATED NAZISM?3)As far as Muslims are concerned : THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEENNAZI GERMANY, AND ANTIMUSLIM COLONIALIST BRITAIN/FRANCE IN 1940. They wereall racist, anti-arab, and full of arrogance and hate. WWII and the wars in ALgeria, Sudan, and other places proved that very clearly. Even anti-semitism was not more spread in Germany than in France or Britain, it justhappened to be official policy in Germany.And we will forgive you, just set our countries free.So any arguments about WWII behaviour coming from the people whokilled millions in that war (from either side) is just plain laughable.Enough said.

 34From Israeline 4/16Two Arabs Killed and Eight IDF Soldiers Wounded in West Bank CarBomb Explosion Israel Defense Forces Radio, GALEI ZAHAL, reports today that a carbomb explosion in the West Bank today killed two Palestinians andwounded eight IDF soldiers. The blast is believed to be the work ofa suicide bomber. Radio reports said a car packed with butane gasexploded between two parked buses, one belonging to the IDF and theother civilian. Both busses went up in flames. The blast killed anArab man who worked at a nearby snack bar in the Mehola settlement.An Israel Radio report stated that the other man who was killed mayhave been the one who set off the bomb. According to officials atthe Haemek Hospital in Afula, the eight IDF soldiers injured in theblast suffered light to moderate injuries.The Arab that was killed was a probably from the Mossad so it is not count as a murder.Naftaly-----Naftaly Stramer  | Intergraph ElectronicsInternet: nstramer@dazixco.ingr.com      | 6101 Lookout Road, Suite A    Voice: (303)581-2370  FAX: (303)581-9972 | Boulder, CO 80301"Quality is everybody's job, and it's everybody's job to watch all that they can."

Excerpt.EACH ONE AND HIS OWN NEVO*(* A reference to General Azri'el Nevo, Shamir's Military Secretary. Irrelevant to this excerpt.)By Nahum Barne'a. . .In mid '91 SHABAK found itself in the center of another storm [...]. A year and a half earlier, Khaled Sheikh Ali, 27, a member of theIslamic Jihad, died at the SHABAK installation in Gaza prison.  Thetwo SHABAK interrogators who were responsible for his death were puton trial. In September '91 the Supreme Court rejected their appeal andsentenced them to 6 months in prison.  As far as is known, this wasthe first time in Israel's history that SHABAK operatives were sent toprison.  The Supreme Court unanimously rejected the warning by thedirector of SHABAK that the sentence will be detrimental theeffectiveness of other interrogators. [...] The judges in the casewere [...] Barak, Goldberg, and Matza.When they realized that they were on their own, the interrogatorsagreed to talk.  Deputy State Attorney Rachel Sukkar[sp?] was placedin charge of investigating the affair.  She [...] questioned thedirectors of all SHABAK divisions.  She investigated only the matterof the death in Gaza prison.  She discovered that not only torture,but also "the culture of lies", which Judge Landau had described inhis report of two years before, were still very much in existence. Nothing had changed.The report was classified and was seen by only some ten people, amongthem the Prime Minister, the people at the top of the judicial systemand Judge Landau.  The director of SHABAK claimed that he did notknow.  After all, they were dealing only with a single jail and withlow ranking people.  The system bit the bullet and accepted theexplanation.  One of SHABAK's high-ranking officials was transferedfrom his very high position to a less high position.. . .["The culture of lies" referred to above is the SHABAK interrogators'policy of lying in court when denying detainees claims that they weretortured in the course of interrogation.  The Landau commission soughtto correct this problem by legalizing a list of torture methods --thus eliminating the fear that a detainee might be released if thosemethods were used to extract a confession.  The fact that the need tolie still persists would seem to indicate that SHABAK is not stickingto the "approved" torture methods. -- Yigal]--Yigal ArensUSC/ISI                                                TV made me do it!arens@isi.edu

 73From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>Subject: Gaza and separation from IsraelGaza and the idea of separationThe Israeli Left's inability to cope with the challenges it ispresented with by reality becomes obvious at those moments whenthe reality does not line up with the expectations of the left. Wewere able to see this clearly during the Gulf War.  Because of thePalestinian's popular solidarity with Iraq, Yossi Sarid -currently Minister of the Environment - made his infamousstatement: "You look for me !", i.e., I'am not making any moreefforts to speak with you. From Yossi Sarid's point of view,Palestinian reality during the Gulf War was not the lengthy curfewor the danger of hunger it brought with it, but whether or not thePalestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party. SimilarlyMERETZ, MK Deddi Tzuker, recently faced with criticism fromresidents of the West Bank town of Beit Sahour over hisgovernment's and his party's lack of action for human rights andpeace, responded by asking those present at the discussion whetherthey would rather have a Likud government. From the Leftists'perspective this is the best government because it is THEIRgovernment, regardless of what it does.These members of the Israeli Left have already decided how thefuture of the Occupied Territories will look, and they want todictate to the Palestinians how to get there. An essential steptowards this future is their participation in Yitzhak Rabin'sgovernment, and from their point of view the expulsions were amarginal byproduct of this "government of peace", which need notdisturb the routine course of events. Likewise the "Rabinic"policies in Gaza - the blowing up of houses with anti-tank rocketsand the significant increases in the number of persons injured inthe suppression of demonstrations - need not disturb it.But the fact that reality is not as they would have it forcesitself upon them when a mob in Gaza falls upon a settler who haslost his way, when a settler is stabbed by his Palestinianworkers, or when a Palestinian knifes people in the streets of TelAviv. Then all hell breaks loose and the Israeli Left has nothingto propose except separation: Let's cut ourselves off from thePalestinians, let's build a fence so high that they won't be ableto harm us - this is the cry of the Israeli Left. Let us erect afence between us and the reality whith is the occupation.Meron Benvenisti writes about this in Ha'aretz (4-3-93): "...Theliberal Left. which does not differentiate between physicalseparation and 'the future of the territories', must come tounderstand that the regime of magnetic cards, exclusion of Arabworkers, closure, and curfew are instruments of enforcementdesigned for the suppression of a population in revolt, and thattheir ideological support for separation only provides'humanitarian' arguments for the legitimization of the <statusquo>.Enforced separation is carried out only to meet the need of theruling community, but it is only the ruled population which bearsits burden. [.....]."Whoover thinks that 'out of Gaza first' is a liberal,humanitarian idea had best contemplate the question of whetherthis position is also moral. It is very easy to shake offresponsibility for this concentration of human suffering, and tothus also disregard responsibility for it's creation. It is veryeasy to erect a fence between Jewish and Arab neighborhoods inJerusalem, when this fence has a gate - the keys to which are atthe disposal of one hand - which opens to allow the Jews to pursueall their interests, but is barred to the Arabs...".------------------------------------------------------>From The OTHER Front, Jerusalem, 10 March 1993

Israel has statedrepeatedly that it will not give up the whole Golan, but may bewilling to give part of it to Syria as part of a peace agreement.Israel has already annexed areas taken over in the 1967 war.These areas are not occupied, but disputed, since there is nolegitamate governing body.  Citizenship was given to those residentsin annexed areas who wanted citizenship.Israel should keep control of parts of the West Bank, IMHO.The parts that should be kept are the westernmost mountain ridge,which contain few arab towns, and many suburbs, as well as overlookingthe city of Tel Aviv.  The Eastern mountain ridge should beabandonded.  This is where most of the arabs live and it is lessmilitarily relevant.  Israel should also maintain a presence in theJordan valley.>If so (for those of you who support it), why were so>many settlers moved into the territories?  If it is not temporary,>let's hear it.There are a number of reasons for people to move (they werenot moved, but chose to move) into disputed areas.  Note that sincethese moves were made by free willed human beings, not "settlers," Iwill address two aspects of your question, why the government wouldallow &/or encourage them to move, and second why they did move.The government had a number of reasons for encouraging peopleto move across the green line.  They included security and politics.The first reason was security.  A large Jewish presense makesit difficult for terrorists to infiltrate.  A Jewish settlements alsoact as fortresses in times of war.A second reason was political.  Creating "settlements" broughtthe arabs to the negotiation table.  Had the creation of new towns andcities gone on another several years, there would be no place left inIsrael where there was an arab majority.  There would have been noland left that could be called arab.The fact that there are a hundered thousands Jews in placechanges the face of any peace settlement, and restricts what land canbe given away.Individuals who crossed the green line had several reasons fordoing so.  They include financial, religious, and political reasons.Many of the communities created were "bedroom" communities.Suburbs.  A house 20 minutes outside of Tel Aviv cost half less if itwas on the wrong side of the green line.  People who moved therewanted a decent home at a nice price.Some of the communites created were religious.  They builttheir neighborhoods in areas where there were jews until the riots ofthe 30's and 40's.  There are communities like this in Hebron, Gaza,and all over.  There are also communities built near religious sites.The last reason people moved was to establish a politicalJewish presense outside the green line.  They built communities tocontrol important intersections, important hilltops, roads, and otherplaces.The point is, there are many reasons people moved over thegreen line, and many reasons the government wanted them to.  Whateverstatus is negotiated for disputed territories, it will not be an "allor nothing" deal.  New boundaries will be drawn up by negotiation, notbe the results of a war.AdamAdam Shostack        adam@das.harvard.edu"If we had a budget big enough for drugs and sexual favors, we surewouldn't waste them on members of Congress..."   -John Perry Barlow

The only help given to Gazans by Israeli# Jews, only dozens of people, is humanitarian assistance.  This sounds like a parallel, but it isn't.  Tell us how many Poles  went into the Ghetto to join the Jews there.  Oops!  For a moment  there I forgot that in Poland, 'humanitarian assistance" could  get you killed.  Come to think of it, humanitarian assistance to  the Gazans can get Israelis killed, too.  Except that in Gaza,  it's likely to be by a Gazan death squad in your own office.  So let's keep the parallel.  Since the gross numbers aren't the  same, we'll need a proportionality value.  Should we use:    * Gazan vs Jewish initial population?    * Gazan vs Jewish death rates?    * Gazans vs Jews who survived five years of occupation?    * Israelis vs Nazis attacked by the 'resistance'?    * Israelis vs Poles charged with aiding the victims?  Since the two cases are so comparable, it shouldn't matter  which we pick, they'll all be about the same, right?------------Contrary to popular hyperbole, the IDF *could* quite easily killoff the entire population of Gaza in hours if they wanted to.(No, I'm not exaggerating.  And I really don't want to discuss how.)Note that a million dead Gazans don't get much more headlinespace than a dozen, and are just as soon forgotten -- and onceexterminated, they can't keep popping up as headlines.So if a "Final Solution" for Gaza would be so much better froma *Realpolitik* standpoint, why doesn't Israel go for it?  Adifficult question to answer for those who can't believe anythinggood about Jews, and probably why they keep trying to force-fitthe facts into the theory.--- D. C.

But the mostimportant problem of those units has been hardly dealt with. It isthat everyone who serves in the Cherry, after a time goes in oneway or another insane".A man who said this, who will here be called Danny (his full nameis known to the editors) served in the Cherry. After his dischargefrom the army he works as delivery boy. His pal, who will here becalled Dudu was also serving in the Cherry, and is now about todepart for a round-the-world tour. They both look no differentfrom average Israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscriptservice. But in their souls, one can notice something completelydifferent....It was not easy for them to come out with disclosuresabout what happened to them. And they think that to most of theirfellows from the Cherry it woundn't be easy either. Yet after theybegan to talk, it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking.The following article will contain all the horror storiesrecounted with an appalling openness.(...) A short time ago I was in command of a veteran team, inwhich some of the fellows applied for release from the Cherry. Wecalled such soldiers H.I. 'Hit by the Intifada'. Under my commandwas a soldier who talked to himself non-stop, which is a commonphenomenon in the Cherry. I sent him to a psychiatrist. But why Ishould talk about others when I myself feel quite insane ? OnFridays, when I come home, my parents know I cannot be talked tountil I go to the beach, surf a little, calm down and return. Thekeys of my father's car must be ready for in advance, so that Ican go there. I they dare talk to me before, or whenever I don'twant them to talk to me, I just grab a chair and smash itinstantly. I know it is my nerve:  Smashing chairs all the timeand then running away from home, to the car and to the beach. Onlythere I become normal.(...)(...) Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother.It was an omelette of sorts. She took the risk of sitting next tome and talking to me. I then told my mother about an event whichwas still fresh in my mind. I told her how I shot an Arab, and howexactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it. She beganto laugh hysterically. I wanted her to cry, and she dared laughstraight in my face instead ! So I told her how my pal had made amincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotovcocktails. He shot them down, hitting them beautifully, exactly asthey deserved. One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire, withthe effect that the Arab was burning all over, just beautifully. Iwas delighted to see it.  My pal fired three bullets, two at theArab with the Molotov cocktail, and the third at his chum. It hithim straight in his ass. We both felt that we'd pulled offsomething.Next I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the gutsin the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward thatspot to take a look. I reached the spot first. And then that Arab,blood gushing forth from his body, spits at me. I yelled: 'Shutup' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew! So I just laughedstraight in his face. I am usually laughing when I stare atsomething convulsing right before my eyes. Then I told him: 'Allright, wait a moment'. I left him in order to take a look atanother wounded Arab. I asked a soldier if that Arab could besaved, if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with thehelp of a stone of something else like that. I keep telling allthis to my mother, with details, and she keeps laughing straightinto my face. This infuriated me. I got very angry, because I feltI was becoming mad. So I stopped eating, seized the plate with heomelette and some trimmings still on, and at once threw it overher head. Only then she stopped laughing. At first she didn't knowwhat to say.(...) But I must tell you of a still other madness which fallsupon us frequently. I went with a friend to practice shooting on afield. A gull appeared right in the middle of the field. My friendshot it at once. Then we noticed four deer standing high up on thehill above us. My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it.We enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. We shot down twodeer more and went to take a look. When we climbed the rocks wesaw a young deer, badly wounded by our bullet, but still trying tosuch some milk from its already dead mother. We carefullyinspected two paths, covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh ofthe two deer we had hit. We were just delighted by that sight. Wehad hit'em so good ! Then we decided to kill the young deer too,so as spare it further suffering. I approached, took out myrevolver and shot him in the head several times from a very shortdistance. When you shoot straight at the head you actually see thebullets sinking in.  But my fifth bullet made its brains falloutside onto the ground, with the effect of splattering lots ofblood straight on us. This made us feel cured of the spurt of ourmadness. Standing there soaked with blood, we felt we were likebeasts of prey. We couldn't explain what had happened to us. Wewere almost in tears while walking down from that hill, and wefelt the whole day very badly.(...) We always go back to places we carried out assignments in.This is why we can see them. When you see a guy you disabled, maybe for the rest of his life, you feel you got power. You feelGodlike of sorts."(...) Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this momentstudying the acting. Dudu is not willing to work in anysecurity-linked occupation. Danny feels the exact opposite. 'Whyshouldn't I take advantage of the skills I have mastered so well ?Why shouldn't I earn $3.000 for each chopped head I would deliverwhile being a mercenary in South Africa ? This kind of job suitsme perfectly. I have no human emotions any more. If I get areasonable salary I will have no problem to board a plane toBosnia in order to fight there."Transl. by Israel Shahak.

 34From _Myths and Facts_, by Leonard J. Davis, Near East Research Inc.,1989:[pp. 108-109]    "Unlike the PLO's almost exclusive focus on civilian targets, the100 troups from the Irgun and Stern group that struck at Deir Yassinon April 10, 1948, targeted the village for its military importance.Deir Yassin was on the road to Jerusalem, which the Arabs hadblockaded, and it housed Iraqi troups and Palestinian irregulars.Snipers based in Deir Yassin were a constant threat to Jewish citizensin Jerusalem.    "Arab civilians were killed at Deir Yassin, but that attack doesnot conform to the propaganda picture that the Arabs have tried topaint. The number of Arabs killed was generally reported to be about250. In 1983, however, Eric Silver of _The Guardian_ (Britain)interviewed a survivor, Mophammed Sammour, who testified that 116 outof a population of 800-1000 were killed. 'About three days after themassacre,' Sammour explained, 'representatives of each of the fiveclans in Deir Yassin met at the Moslem offices in Jerusalem and made alist of the people who had not been found (alive). We went through thenames.  Nothing has happend since 1948 to make me think this figurewas wrong.'    "Unlike the PLO's deliberate attacks on civilians, the killing ofcivilians at Deir Yassin was not premeditated. The attackers left openan escape corridor from the village and more than 200 residents leftunharmed. After the remaining Arabs feigned surrender and then firedon the Jewish troops, some of the attackers killed Arab soldiers andcivilians indiscriminately. Independent observers told _The Guardian_that among the bodies they found Arab men disguised as women."

Sudan-----Government troops 'steal women, children'WASHINGTON - Government troops in Sudan are involved in massacres,kidnapping and the transporting of forced labor into Libya, accordingto a State Department document declassified Wednesday.    The report compiled by the U.S. embassy in Khartoum said governmentforces, particularly Arab militias organized as the Popular DefenseForces, "routinely steal women and children" in southern Sudan.    "Some women and girls are kept as wives, the others are shippednorth where they perform forces labor on Kordofan (central Sudan) farms or are exproted, notably to Libya," it said.
 37From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>Subject: Hebrew labor: racist connotationsAVODA IVRIT - HEBREW LABOR---------------------------------"Hebrew labor" is a concept which has served the Zionist movementfor a long time.  It has a double-barreled message: 1) The new Jewmust learn to do physical labor, i.e. working the land; 2) Theland in this country must pass into Jewish hands, i.e. to the samenew Jew who has "learned" to work it. Both aspects of thetwo-pronged concept of "Hebrew labor" have racist connotations. Onthe one hand, the diaspora Jew's lack of training in physicallabor is a myth shared by Zionists and antisemites.  On the otherhand, its meaning in practice has been the displacement of theArab farmer from the source of his livelihood.The occupation and the cheap Palestinian labor which streamed fromthe occupied territories to the factories, orchards, andhot-houses of Israel relegated the myth of "Hebrew labor" to thehistory books and nostalgic memories of the Zionist Movement. Ithas blossomed forth anew, however, as the government's answer toproblems caused by the closure of the territories. Today too thisconcept has two functions: 1) to give a progressive look to theclosing of the Palestinian population.  Or in the words ofEnvironment Minister Yossi Sarid, "I have no tears for those whoget rich off of cheap labor". 2) to furnish an answer to theunemployed Israeli who complains of being obliged to work forwages that are lower than the unemployment insurance he receives.The Israeli government is considering plans to import labor fromthe far- East to replace native people, Palestinians, who work intheir own country, thus creating conflicting interests between twoethnical communities and ruling over them.

 49I have found Jewish people very imagentative and creative. Jewish religion was the foundation for Christianity andIslam.  In other words Judaism has fathered both religions. Now Islam has turned against its father I may say.It is Ironic that after communizem threat is almost gone, religion wars are going to be on the raise. I thought the idea of believing on one God, was to Unite all man kind. How come both Jews and Islam which believeon the same God, "the God of Ebrahim" are killing each other? Is this like Dr. Frankenstien's story?How are you going to stop this from happening? How are you going to deal with so many Muslims. Nuking them would distroy the whole world? Would God get mad, since you have killed his followers, you believe on the sameGod, same heaven and the same hell after all? What is the peacefull way of ending this Saga?Man kind needs religion, since it sets up the rules and the regulations which keeps the society in a healthy state.A religion is mostly a sets of rules which people have experienced and know it works for the society.The praying, keeps the sole healthy and meditates it. God does not care for man kinds pray, but man kind hopesthat God will help him when he prays.Religion works mostly on the moral issues and trys to put away the materialistic things in the life. But the religious leaders need to make a living through religion? So they  may corrupt it, or turn it to their own way tomake their living. i.e Muslims have to pay  %20 percent of their income to the Mullahs. I guess the rabie  gets hiscut too! Is in it that religion should be such that everybody on planet earth respects each other, be good toward each otherhelps one another, respect the mother nature. Is in that heaven and hell are created on earth through the acts that we take today?  Is in it that within every man there is good and bad, he could choose either one, then he willsee the outcome of his choice.  How can we prevent man kind from going crazy over religion. How can we stopanother religious killing field, under poor Gods name? What are your thoughts? Do you think man kind wouldto come its senses, before it is too late?P.S. on the sideDo you think that Moses saw the God on mount Sina? Why would God go to top of the mountain? He createdthe earth, he could have been anywhere? why on top the mountain? Was it because people thought to see Godyou have to reach to the skies/heavens? Why God kept coming back to Middle East? Was it because they createdGod through their imagination?  Is that why Jewish people were told by God, they were the chosen ones?Profit Mohammad was married to Khadijeh. She was a Jewish. She taught him how to trade. She probably taughthim about Judaism. Quran is mostly copy right of Taurah (sp? old testement). Do you think God wrote Quran?Makeh was a trade city before Islam. Do you think it was made to be the center of Islamic world because Mohammadwanted to expand his trade business? Is that why  God has put his house in there? I think this religious stuff has gone too far. All man kind are going to hurt from it if they do not wise up.Look at David Koresh, how that turned out? I am afraid in the bigger scale, the Jews and the Muslims willhave the same ending!!!!!!!!Religion is needed in the sense to keep people in harmony and keep them doing good things, rather thanplotting each others distruction.  There is one earth, One life and one God. Let's all man kind be good towardeach other.God help us all.Peace

Depew has shown himself to be unrepentant (though embarrassed) and>still possessed of the same fucked-up hubris-laden self-righteousness thatThe theory is that the hollering kills the spirit of the criminal/Nazi Armenians of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle. Now, try dealing with the rest of what I wrote.What is more, the activities of the Armenian Government seem to have beenefforts aimed at eradicating a race (the Turks) or aimed at carrying out aone-sided feud, instead of being a struggle for liberation. From the outset,the efforts of the Armenian revolutionaries within the Ottoman borders tookthe form of terrorist and destructive actions aimed at mass murder, crueltyand genocide, so that no other interpretation of them is possible. Armenianactivities started during the reign of Abdulhamid II as individual acts ofterror, and then developed into assassinations and surprise attacks. The elementof brute force in these activities increased steadily, culminating in massrebellions and widespread fighting during the First World War. Furthermore,when the Ottoman army withdrew from Eastern Anatolia after the 1915 Sarikamisdefeat, Armenian revolutionaries initiated a series of cruelties in this area.Although the Russians occupied Eastern Anatolia as an enemy, nevertheless theywere constrained by the rules of war. However, when they returned to theircountry in 1917 after the Revolution, Armenian revolutionaries were uncheckedin this area for about a year until the Ottoman forces returned to Erzurumin 1918. During this period, Armenian revolutionaries executed massacres onthe local people which is recorded in historical documents.[1]For example, let us look at a report dated 21 March 1918 which the Commanderof the Third Army submitted when he entered Erzurum and Erzincan:  "They were completely and systematically destroyed and burned down   by Armenians, even the trees were cut down, and they are like a   building entirely consumed by fire in every sense of the word." As for the people who had been living in Erzurum and Erzincan:"Those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning with the excuse of forced labor in road construction, they were taken in the direction of Sarikamis and annihilated. When the Russian army withdrew, a part of the remaining people was destroyed in Armenian massacres and cruelties: they were thrown into wells, they were locked in houses and burned down, they were killed with bayonets and swords, in places selected as butchering spots, their bellies were torn open, their lungs were pulled out, and girls and women were hanged by their hair after being subjected to every conceivable abominable act. A very small part  of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to. Including women and children, such persons discovered so far do not exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in Erzurum. All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled, everything that the people had has been taken away from them, and we found them in a destitute situation. At the present time, the people are subsisting on some food they obtained, impelled by starvation, from Russian storages left behind after their occupation of this area."[2] Foreign observers who witnessed the events, including Russian Officerswho did not desert their lines, submitted detailed reports proving thegenocide to Ottoman commanders who received them as prisoners of war.What is most important is that they stated in their reports 'the massacres did not happen by chance but were planned.'[3]At the end of the war, the German author Dr. Weiss, his Austrian colleagueDr. Stein and his Turkish colleague Mr. Ahmet Vefik visited Trabzon, Kars,Erzurum and Batum between April 17th and May 20th 1918 to record thecruelties. Their writings not only show the scope of Armenian activities,but also reveal their goal and true nature.[4][1] (The Ottoman State, the Ministry of War), "Islam Ahalinin Ducar Olduklari    Mezalim Hakkinda Vesaike Mustenid Malumat," (Istanbul, 1918).

What was he killed for. He hadn't hurt anyone, hadn't said any word he oughtn't have. Why did they kill him? I want to find out--from here, from there, from the government--why my husband was killed.On the 27th, when I returned from work--it was a Saturday--my son was at home.He doesn't work. I went straight to the kitchen, and he called me, "Mamma, is there a soccer game?" There were shouts from Lenin Street. That's where we lived. I say, "I don't know, Igor, I haven't turned on the TV." He looked again and said, "Mamma, what's going on in the courtyard?!" I look and see so many people, it's awful, marching, marching, there are hundreds, thousands, you can't even tell how many there are. They're shouting, "Down with the Armenians! Kill the Armenians! Tear the Armenians to pieces!" My God, why is that happening, what for? I had known nothing at that point. We lived togetherwell, in friendship, and suddenly something like this. It was completely unexpected. And they were shouting, "Long live Turkey!" And they had flags,and they were shouting. There was a man walking in front well dressed, he's around 40 or 45, in a gray raincoat. He is walking and saying something, I can't make it out through the vent window. He is walking and saying something,and the children behind him are shouting, "Tear the Armenians to pieces!" and "Down with the Armenians!" They shout it again, and then shout, "Hurrah!" The people streamed without end, they were walking in groups, and in the groups I saw that there were women, too. I say, "My God, there are women there too!" And my son says, "Those aren't women, Mamma, those are bad women." Well we didn't look a long time. They were walking and shouting and I was afraid, I simply couldn't sit still. I went out onto the balcony, and my Azerbaijani neighbor is on the other balcony, and I say, "Khalida, what's going on, what happened?" She says, "Emma, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what happened." Well she was quite frightened too. They had these white sticks, each second or third one had a white rod. They're waving the rods above their heads as they walk, and the one who's out front, like a leader, he has a whitestick too. Well maybe it was an armature shaft, but what I saw was white, I don't know.My husband got home 10 or 15 minutes later. He comes home and I say, "Oh dear, I'm frightened, they're going to kill us I bet." And he says, "What are you afraid of, they're just children." I say, "Everything that happens comes from children." There had been 15- and 16-year kids from the Technical and Vocational School. "Don't fear," he said, "it's nothing, nothing all that bad." He didn't eat, he just lay on the sofa. And just then on television theybroadcast that two Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabakh, near Askeran. When I heard that I couldn't settle down at all, I kept walking here and there and I said, "They're going to kill us, the Azerbaijanis are going to kill us." And he says, "Don't be afraid." Then we heard--from the central square, there are women shouting near near the stage, well, they're shoutingdifferent things, and you couldn't hear every well. I say, "You speakAzerbaijani well, listen to what they're saying." He says "Close the windowand go to bed, there s nothing happening there." He listened a bit and then closed the window and went to bed, and told us, "Come on, go to sleep, it'snothing." Sleep, what did he mean sleep?  My Son and I stood at the windowuntil two in the morning watching. Well he's sick, and all of this wasaffecting him. I say, "Igor, you go to bed, I'm going to go to bed in a minutetoo." He went and I sat at the window until three, and then went to bed. Things had calmed down slightly.The 28th, Sunday, was my day off. My husband got up and said, "Come on, Emma, get up." I say, "Today's my day off, let me rest." He says, "Aren't you going to make me some tea?" Well I felt startled and got up, and said, "Where are you going?" He says, "I'm going out, I have to." I say, "Can you really go outside on a day like today? Don't go out, for God's sake. You never listen tome, I know, and you're not going to listen to me now, but at least don't take the car out of the garage, go without the car." And he says, "Come on, close the door!" And then on the staircase he muttered something, I couldn't make itout, he probably said "coward" or something.I closed the door and he left. And I started cleaning . . . picking things uparound the house . . . Everything seemed quiet until one o'clock in the after-noon, but at the bus station, my neighbor told me, cars were burning. I said,"Khalida, was it our car?" She says, "No, no, Emma, don't be afraid, theywere government cars and Zhigulis.'' Our car is a GAZ-21 Volga. And I waited,it was four o'clock, five o'clock . . . and when he wasn't home at seven Isaid, "Oh, they've killed Shagen!"Tires are burning in town, there's black smoke in town, and I'm afraid, I'm standing on the balcony and I'm all . . . my whole body is shaking. My God, they've probably killed him! So basically I waited like that until ten o'clock and he still hadn't come home. And I'm afraid to go out. At teno'clock I look out: across from our building is a building with a bookstore,and from upstairs, from the second floor, everything is being thrown outside. I'm looking out of one window and Igor is looking out of the other, and I don't want him to see this, and he, as it turns out, doesn't want me to see it. We wanted to hide it from one another. I joined him. "Mamma," he says,"look what they're doing over there!" They were burning everything, and there were police standing there, 10 or 15 of them, maybe twenty policemen standing on the side, and the crowd is on the other side, and two or three people are throwing everything down from the balcony. And one of the ones on the balcony is shouting, "What are you standing there for, burn it!" When they threw the television, wow, it was like a bomb! Our neighbor on the third floor came out on her balcony and shouted, "Why are you doing that, why are you burning thosethings, those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their home. Why are you burning them?" And from the courtyard they yell at her, "Go inside, go inside! Instead why don't you tell us if they are any of them in your building or not?" They meant Armenians, but they didn't say Armenians, they said, "of them." She says, "No, no, no, none!" Then she ran downstairs toour place, and says, "Emma, Emma, you have to leave!" I say, "They've killedShagen anyway, what do we have to live for? It won't be living for me without Shagen. Let them kill us, too!" She insists, saying, "Emma, get out of here, go to Khalida's, and give me the key. When they come I'll say that it's my daughter's apartment, that they're off visiting someone." I gave her the key and went to the neighbor's, but I couldn't endure it. I say, "Igor, you stay here, I'm going to go downstairs, and see, maybe Papa's . . . Papa's there."Meanwhile, they were killing the two brothers, Alik and Valery [Albert and Valery Avanesians; see the accounts of Rima Avanesian and Alvina Baluian], in the courtyard. There is a crowd near the building, they're shouting, howling, and I didn't think that they were killing at the time. Alik and Valery livedin the corner house across from ours. When I went out into the courtyard I sawan Azerbaijani, our neighbor, a young man about 30 years old. I say, "Madar, Uncle Shagen's gone, let's go see, maybe he's dead in the garage or near the garage, let's at least bring the corpse into the house. "He shouts, "Aunt Emma, where do you think you're going?! Go back into the house, I'll look for him." I say, "Something will happen to you, too, because of me, no, Madar, I'm coming too." Well he wouldn't let me go all the same, he says, "You stay here with us, I'm go look." He went and looked, and came back and said, "Aunt Emma, there's no one there, the garage is closed. "Madar went off again and then returned and said, "Aunt Emma, they're already killed Alik, and Valery's there . . . wheezing."Madar wanted to go up to him, but those scoundrels said, "Don't go near him, or we'll put you next to him." He got scared--he's young--and came back and said, "I'm going to go call, maybe an ambulance will come, at least to take Alik, maybe he'll live . . . " They grew up together in our courtyard, they knew each other well, they had always been on good terms. He went to call, butnot a single telephone worked, they had all been shut off. He called, and called, and called, and called--nothing.I went upstairs to the neighbor's. Igor says, "Two police cars drove up over there, their headlights are on, but they're not touching them, they are still lying where they were, they're still lying there . . . "We watched out thewindow until four o'clock, and then went downstairs to our apartment. I didn'ttake my clothes off. I lay on the couch so as not to go to bed, and at sixo'clock in the morning I got up and said, "Igor, you stay here at home, don'tgo out, don't go anywhere, I'm going to look, I have to find Papa, dead oralive . . . let me go . . . I've got the keys from work."At six o'clock I went to the Emergency Hospital. The head doctor and another doctor opened the door to the morgue. I run up to them and say, "Doctor, is Shagen there?" He says, "What do you mean? Why should Shagen be here?!" I wanted to go in, but he wouldn't let me. There were only four people in there,they said. Well, they must have been awful because they didn't let me in. Theysaid, "Shagen's not here, he's alive somewhere, he'll come back."It's already seven o'clock in the morning. I look and there is a panel truckwith three policemen. Some of our people from the hospital were there withthem. I say, "Sara Baji ["Sister" Sara, term of endearment], go look, they'veprobably brought Shagen." I said it, shouted it, and she went and came backand says, "No, Emma, he has tan shoes on, it's a younger person." Now Shagen just happened to have tan shoes, light tan, they were already old. When they said it like that I guessed immediately. I went and said, "Doctor, they've brought Shagen in dead." He says, "Why are you carrying on like that, dead, dead . . . he's alive." But then he went all the same, and when he came back the look on his face was . . . I could tell immediately that he was dead. Theyknew one another well, Shagen had worked for him a long time. I say, "Doctor, is it Shagen?" He says, "No, Emma, it's not he, it's somebody else entirely." I say, "Doctor, why are you deceiving me, I'll find out all the same anyway, if not today, then tomorrow." And he said . . . I screamed, right there in theoffice. He says, "Emma, go, go calm down a little." Another one of our colleagues said that the doctor had said it was Shagen, but . . . in hideous condition. They tried to calm me down, saying it wasn't Shagen. A few minutes later another colleague comes in and says, "Oh, poor Emma!" When she said it like that there was no hope left.   That day was awful. They were endlessly bringing in dead and injured people.At night someone took me home. I said, "Igor, Papa's been killed."On the morning of the 1st I left Igor at home again and went to the hospital: I had to bury him somehow, do something. I look and see that the hospital is surrounded by soldiers. They are wearing dark clothes. "Hey, citizen, where are you going?" I say, "I work here," and from inside someone shouts, "Yes, yes, that's our cook, let her in." I went right to the head doctor's officeand there is a person from the City Health Department there, he used towork with us at the hospital. He says, "Emma, Shagen's been taken to Baku.In the night they took the wounded and the dead, all of them, to Baku." Isay, "Doctor, how will I bury him?" He says, "We're taking care of all that,don't you worry, we'll do everything, we'll tell you about it. Where did youspend the night?" I say, "I was at home." He says, "What do you mean youwere at home?! You were at home alone?" I say, "No, Igor was there too." Hesays, "You can't stay home, we're getting an ambulance right now, wait justone second, the head doctor is coming, we're arranging an ambulance rightnow, you put on a lab coat and take one for Igor, you go and bring Igor herelike a patient, and you'll stay here and we'll se~ later what to do next ..."His last name is Kagramanov. The head doctor's name is Izyat JamalogliSadukhov.The "ambulance" arrived and I went home and got Igor. They admitted him as a patient, they gave us a private room, an isolation room. We stayed in the hospital until the 4th.Some police car came and they said, "Emma, let's go." And the women, our colleagues, then they saw the police car, became anxious and said, "Where are you taking her?" I say, "They're going to kill me, too . . . " And theinvestigator says, "Why are you saying that, we're going to make a positiveidentification." We went to Baku and they took me into the morgue . . . Istill can't remember what hospital it was . . . The investigator says, "Let's go, we need to be certain, maybe it's not Shagen." And when I saw the caskets,lying on top of one another, I went out of my mind. I say, "I can't look, no."The investigator says, "Are there any identifying marks?" I say, "Let me seethe clothes, or the shoes, or even a sock, I'll recognize them." He says, "Isn't they're anything on his body?" I say he has seven gold teeth and his finger, he only has half of one of his fingers. Shagen was a carpenter, he hadbeen injured at work . . .They brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing, they brought them and they were all burned . . . When I saw them I shouted, "Oh, they burned him!" I shouted, I don't know, I fell down . . . or maybe I sat down, I don't remember. And that investigator says, "Well fine, fine, since we've identified that these are his clothes, and since his teeth . . . sincehe has seven gold teeth . . . "On the 4th they told me: "Emma, it's time to bury Shagen now." I cried, "How, how can I bury Shagen when I have only one son and he's sick? I should inform his relatives, he has three sisters, I can't do it by myself." They say, "OK, you know the situation. How will they get here from Karabagh? How will they get here from Yerevan? There's no transportation, it s impossible."He was killed on February 28, and I buried him on March 7. We buried him in Sumgait. They asked me, "Where do you want to bury him?" I said, "I want to bury him in Karabagh, where we were born, let me bury him in Karabagh," I'm shouting, and the head of the burial office, I guess, says, "Do you know what it means, take him to Karabagh?! It means arson!" I say, "What do you mean, arson? Don't they know what's going on in Karabagh? The whole world knows thatthey killed them, and I want to take him to Karabagh, I don't have anyone anymore." I begged, I pleaded, I grieved, I even got down on my knees. Hesays, "Let's bury him here now, and in three months, in six months, a year, if it calms down, I'll help you move him to Karabagh . . . "Our trial was the first in Sumgait. It was concluded on May 16. At theinvestigation the murderer, Tale Ismailov, told how it all happened, but thenat the trial he . . . tried to wriggle . . . he tried to soften his crime. Then they brought a videotape recorder, I guess, and played it, and said, "Ismailov, look, is that you?" He says, "Yes." "Well look, here you're describing everything as it was on the scene of the crime, right?" He says, "Yes." "And now you're telling it differently?" He says, "Well maybe I forgot!" Like that.The witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was goingalong Mir Street, there was a crowd of about 80 people . . . Shagen had a Volga GAZ-21. The 80 people surrounded his car, and all 80 of them were involved. One of them was this Ismailov guy, this Tale. They--it's unclearwho--started pulling Shagen out of the car. Well, one says from the left sideof the car, another says from the right side. They pulled off his sports jacket. He had a jacket on. Well they ask him, "What's your nationality?" He says, "Armenian." Well they say from the crowd they shouted, "If he's anArmenian, kill him, kill him!" They started beating him, they broke seven ofhis ribs, and his heart . . . I don't know, they did something there, too . . . it's too awful to tell about. Anyway, they say this Tale guy . . . he had an armature shaft. He says, "I picked it up, it was lying near a bush, that's where I got it." He said he picked it up, but the witnesses say that hehad already had it. He said, "I hit him twice," he said, " . . . once or twiceon the head with that rod." And he said that when he started to beat him Shagen was sitting on the ground, and when he hit him he fell over. He said, "I left, right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment,killing someone," he says, "and I came back to look, is that Shagen alive ornot?" I said, "You wanted to finish him, right, and if he was still alive, youcame back to hit him again?" He went back and looked and he was already dead."After that," that bastard Tale said, "after that I went home."I said, "You . . . you . . . little snake," I said, "Are you a thief and a murderer?" Shagen had had money in his jacket, and a watch on his wrist. Theywere taken. He says he didn't take themWhen they overturned and burned the car, that Tale was no longer there, it wasother people who did that. Who it was, who turned over the car and who burnedit, that hasn't been clarified as yet. I told the investigator, "How can you have the trial when you don't know who burned the car?" He said something, butI didn't get what he was saying. But I said, "You still haven't straightened everything out, I think that's unjust."When they burned the car he was lying next to it, and the fire spread to him. In the death certificate it says that he had third-degree burns over 80percent of his body . . .And I ask again, why was he killed? My husband was a carpenter; he was a good craftsman, he knew how to do everything, he even fixed his own car, with his own hands. We have three children. Three sons. Only Igor was with me at the time. The older one was in Pyatigorsk, and the younger one is serving in the Army. And now they're fatherless...I couldn't sit all the way through it. When the Procurator read up to 15years' deprivation of freedom, I just . . . I went out of my mind, I didn'tknow what to do with myself, I said, "How can that be? You," I said, "you are saying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is 15 years' deprivation of freedom?" I screamed, I had my mind! I said, "Let me at thatcreep, with my bare hands I'll . . . " A relative restrained me, and therewere all those military people there . . . I lest. I said," This isn't a Soviet trial, this is unjust!" That's what I shouted, l said it and left . . .I said that on February 27, when those people were streaming down our street, they were shouting, "Long live Turkey!" and "Glory to Turkey!" And during the trial I said to that Ismailov, "What does that mean, 'Glory to Turkey'?" I still don't understand what Turkey has to do with this, we live in the Soviet Union. That Turkey told you to or is going to help you kill Armenians? I stilldon't understand why "Glory to Turkey!" I asked that question twice and got noanswer . . . No one answered me . . .

 14Nntp-Posting-Host: sdcc14.ucsd.edu    April 24th is approaching, and Armenians around the worldare getting ready to remember the massacres of their family membersby the Turkish government between 1915 and 1920.      At least 1.5 Million Armenians perished during that period,and it is important to note that those who deny that this eventever took place, either supported the policy of 1915 to exterminatethe Armenians, or, as we have painfully witnessed in Azerbaijan,would like to see it happen again...

Crown Publishers, Inc., New York (1952). (Memoirs of an American officer who witnessed the Armenian genocide of 2.5  million Muslim people)p. 361 (seventh paragraph) and p. 362 (first paragraph). 'The most are inside houses. Come you and look.' 'No, dammit! My stomach isn't-' 'One is a Turkish officer in uniform. Him you must see.' "We were under those trees by the mosque, in an open space.... 'I don't believe you," I said, but followed to a nail-studded door. The   man pushed it ajar, then spurred away, leaving me to check on the corpse.   I thought I should, this charge was so constant, so gritted my teeth and   went inside. The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes, and was dark at first, for  its stone walls had only window slits. Rags strewed the mud floor around an  iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black  with soot. All looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. As  the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face  up, naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what  was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted,  as with Tartars rather than with Turks. Any uniform once on him was gone, so  I'd no proof which he was, and quickly went out, gagging at the mess of his   slashed genitals."p. 363 (first paragraph).  'How many people lived there?' 'Oh, about eight hundred.' He yawned. 'Did you see any Turk officers?' 'No, sir. I was in at dawn. All were Tartar civilians in mufti.' "The lieutenant dozed off, then I, but in the small hours a voice woke me -  Dro's. He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. Anyone keelhauled so long and furiously I'd never heard. Then abruptly Dro broke into  laughter, quick and simple as child's. Both were a cover for his sense of guilt, I thought, or hoped. For somehow, despite my boast of irreligion, Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would have been. From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around..... The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel's chattels, the last  scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags,  looms, even spinning-wheels. 'Thank you for a lot, Dro,' I said to him back in camp. 'But now I must  leave.'...We shook hands, the captain said 'A bientot, mon camarade.' And  for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains.  Like Lot's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all, doubtless in  a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran.'"p. 354."At morning tea, Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole high region called the Karabakh. Deep in tactics, they spoke Russian, but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust of promises made by tribal chiefs. A campaign shaped; more raids on Moslem villages."p. 358."It will be three hours to take," Dro told me. We'd close in on three sides."The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets," Merrimanovsaid, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow."That is for morale," Dro put in. "We must keep the Moslems in terror.""Soldiers or civilians?" I asked."There is no difference," said Dro. "All are armed, in uniform or not.""But the women and children?""Will fly with the others as best they may."p. 360."The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. Hundreds of feet  down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that,' said  Dro, pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.' Then, 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling; then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though  I heard our Utica brass roar. As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed, dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly. The came a shrill wailing. Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot. 'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries. At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and  tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly, through alders, on smoldering houses. Across trampled wheat my brothers-in- arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb."p. 361 (fourth paragraph)."Corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair,  large eyes. She looked about twelve years old. She lay in some stubble  where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. The bayonet  had gone through her back, I judged, for blood around was scant. Between  the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun  dress. The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He  lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the  pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed  just below his neck, into the spine.  There were grownups, too, I saw as I led the sorrel around. Djul was  empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's German-speaking  colonel. He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead."p. 358. "...more stories of Armenian murdering Turks when the czarist troops fled  north. My hosts told me of their duty here: to keep tabs on brigands,   Turkish troop shifts, hidden arms, spies - Christian, Red or Tartar -  coming in from Transcaucasus. Then they spoke of the hell that would   break loose if Versailles were to put, as threatened, the six 'Armenian'  vilayets of Turkey under the control of Erevan...  An Armenia without Armenians! Turks under Christian rule? His lips  smacked in irony under the droopy red moustache. That's bloodshed - just  Smyrna over again on a bigger scale."Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

Did you ever read newspaper at all?"PAINFUL SEARCH .."THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armeniansin the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of thefour-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officialsand casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aidworkers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one ofthe last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full controlof Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiationsin Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fightingretreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of thedead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was firstsuppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-strickenAzerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000dead.The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  "HojaliDisaster", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum onpreliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  ElmanMemmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed inthe Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and morethan 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswomanof the Azeri Ministry of Defence.FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the InternationalRed Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city ofAgdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosquefrom  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. "We  did  not count  thebodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy," MrZen Ruffinen said. "We have some idea since we gave the body bagsand products to wash the dead."Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  thenumber of  dead in the  massacre. "Don't  get worked up.  It willtake  several months  to  get a  final  figure," the  43-year-oldlawyer said at his small office.Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years toreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalistuprising in Baku in January 1990.Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  powerthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactlywhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, beingthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by therepublic's forensic department. "This  is just a small percentageof the dead," said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensicscientist. "They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember thechaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and buryour dead within 24 hours."Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 andaxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highlandsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs ofdeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penisescut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov'sreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of thosebelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  stilldisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, sixpolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, thenames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. Themost heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so farcomes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  ahelicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27February."There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground tocount properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the streamand the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village," MrManafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopterpilot."People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children andone  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  waspulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land butArmenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had toreturn."There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  incirculation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last fewmonths and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojaliat the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villagestaken over by Armenian forces.THE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92HEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIESAREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  theCaspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches inhis trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town ofHojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope."I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,"the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  theHojali disaster. "I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky tobe alive."Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricityfor more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on theedge of Karabakh."At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heardbefore,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavymachine-guns, the lot," Mr Sadikov said.Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the directionof  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  startedfleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through thesnow into a forest on the other side.To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdamabout 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it,until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the twoArmenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak."None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted bya  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started openingfire," Mr Sadikov said.Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forwardto force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their effortswere mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from hisgroup of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiamanson.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his67-year-old elder brother."I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,"he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. "Wehave never got any of the bodies back."The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as hestruggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group'scrossing, Mr Sadikov said.Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he andseveral others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushyhillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep threeArmenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there waslittle comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population wassoon to flee."The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenianrocket attack. Some people just  kept going," Mr Sadikov said. "Ihad to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way.They even found a bullet in my sock."Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in theHojali massacre in February  (left).

It is    disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich   or any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed    solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.I agree that the death of three soldiers on a patrol etc... isnot terrorism.  That having been said, lets continue.   [snip]   imagine ????  It is NOT a "terrorist camp" as you and the Israelis like    to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer   in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....I would not argue that all or even most of the villages are "terroristcamps".  There are however some which come very close to serving thatpurpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that wayprior to the invasion.    SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of   the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not    know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often   suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are   supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and   ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps   for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured   by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages   of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they   are back they announce that they bombed a "terrorist  hideout" where   an 8 year old girl just happened to be.Some of the villages, and yours might well be among them, are as youdescribe.  Not all are.  There are a large number of groups in the area,backed by various organizations, with a wide range of purposes.  Hizbollahand Amal were two of the larger ones and may still be.  As to retaliation,while mistakes may be made, that is still a far cry from indiscriminatebombing, which would have produced major casualties.   Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that   we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance   on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING    ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real    leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.Well, here we disagree.  I think that Israel would willingly withdraw ifthe Lebanese gov't was able to field a reliable force in the area to policeit and prevent further attacks.   This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to   realize that the concept of a "buffer zone" aimed at protecting   its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more   Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel   would have resulted in.  Actually that is not clear at all.  I will agree that the death toll is nolonger civilian and now primarily military though.   There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese   goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such    circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is   capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did   in all other parts of Lebanon.No, the Syrian gov't is more than happy to have Israel sink into anotherLebanese morass.  I could elaborate if necessary.   I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing   CANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.No, but it is regretable, as is the whole situation.--Shai Guday              | Stealth bombers,OS Software Engineer    |Thinking Machines Corp. |the winged ninjas of the skies.Cambridge, MA           |

I respect anybody  who dissagrees with me as long as he respects me and discusses in a  civilized manner. I would never say that anybody that critizises Israel  and/or its politics is an antisemite, except he uses antisemitic  vocabulary/terminology/demagogy. Israel is not a perfect country and  its politicians also commits errors, even some of them are corrupt  (like politicians in any other country), but they carry a huge burden:  to care for the safety of ALL its citizens, and that is really not an  easy task in a country that is surrounded by enemies who only expect  that Israel commits the ONE BIG ERROR and wipe the country (and its  Jewish citizens plus the so-called collaborators, arabs that wanted to  live in peace with their Jewish neighbours) of the map. As I said,  Israel is not a perfect country, but it is the ONLY democracy in the  whole Middle-East and the only country in the world where Jews from  everywhere can have a refuge in case of persecutions in the countries  they are living.  Our long history has taught us that we cannot rely on non-Jewish  nations and its governments: as soon as there are more or les big  social-economical-political problems in any country, the first ones  that pay for the broken glasses are the Jews, and later the other  minorities of the country.  > I don't think the suffering of some Jews during WWII                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > justifies the crimes commited by the Israeli government.

I can't help but wonder what would happen if allviolence against Israelis stopped.  Hopefully, violence against Arabswould stop at the same time.  If a state of non-violence could be maintained, perhaps a state of cooperation could be achieved, i.e.,greater economic opportunities for both peoples living in the"territories".  Of course, given the current leadership of Israel, your way may workalso - but if that leadership changes, e.g., to someone with ArielSharon's mentality, then I would predict a considerable loss of life,i.e., no winners.Secondly, regarding your comment about the U.S. troops respondingto "stiff resistance" - the analogy is not quite valid.  The U.S.troops could get out of the neighborhood altogether.  The Israeliscould not.Just my $.02 worth, no offense intended.Respectfully,     Ben.

Shedding Some Light On September 29 1990, the National Council on US-Arab Relations invited the Kuwaiti Ambassador to the United States, Saud Nasser Al-Sabah. The following are quotes of his speech: ``Kuwait itself was an entity identified as Kuwait even before Iraq was identified as Iraq in the Ottoman Empire. Kuwait was in existence since 1752. We continued to be in existence until the conflict between the Ottoman Empire and the British and others in the area. Thereafter, we signed with the British in 1899 a protective agreement whereby the British guaranteed the sovereignty and security of Kuwait.'' ``In 1913, the British and the Ottoman signed an agreement defining without any doubt the borders of Kuwait as they stand today. Such an agreement was reconfirmed in 1932 between the Kuwaiti government and the Iraqi government at that time. That is when Iraq became a state, after Kuwait itself.'' ``In 1961, when we declared our independence Iraq seized the opportunity to claim Kuwait as part of Iraq. There were threats. The British came in, and Arab forces came in to guarantee the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait. In 1963, Kuwait and Iraq again signed border agreement, thereby defining our territory and Iraq's recognition to the sovereignty and territory of Kuwait.'' ---Compiled by Firyal Alshalalbi Origins of Kuwait The establishment of Kuwait is attributed to Barrak b. Ghurair of the Bani Khalid who used Kuwait as a summer residence. The beginning of Kuwait goes back to the late 17th century and some historians go further up to 1611. Kuwait's name is derived from al-Kut which means fortress. Kuwait is also called Qurain, which is the diminutive of qarn, a horn or hill. Kuwait town flourished and grew since its establishment. The 'Utub, al-Sabah family is a branch of 'Utub, settled in Kuwait during the early 18th century. They lived under the protection of Bani Khalid until 1752. After that, they became independent and Sabah Bin Jabir was chosen as the first ruler for 'Utub. Carsten Niebuhr (1733-1815) a Dutch explorer was among the first who wrote about the Arabia. He was the mathematician in the scientific expedition sent in 1760 by the King of Denmark to Arabia. He documented details of Arab tribes inhabiting both coasts of the Gulf and in the case of Kuwait, he was the first writer to give the two names by which the town was known, Kuwait and Qurain. Niebuhr's chart of the Persian Gulf was the best one drawn before the end of that century, see the map from Abu Hakima, History of Eastern Arabia 1750-1800. pub.1965. Al-Sabah ('Utub) kept good relations with other powers in the eastern Arabia. According to Ahmed Abu Hakima's conclusions in his well documented study about the history of eastern Arabia between 1750-1800, there was no Ottoman rule on the region. ``In the second half of the 18th century, there was no Ottoman ruler in Eastern Arabia. In fact, Ottoman rule was not even nominally acknowledged. Their attempts to restore their lost position in al-Hasa through the campaign of Thuwayni in 1786, and Ali Pasha's expedition against the Wahhabis in 1798, were unsuccessful. At Kuwait, the nearest point of the Utbi domains to the Ottoman Mutasallimiyya of Basra, the Shaikh was under no form of Ottoman control. The aim of 'Utbi external policy was to keep on friendly relations with all the forces working in the Gulf.'' (p. 182-183) Abu Hakima continued in his conclusions that ``Kuwait was not a dependency of Basra, the Persian occupation of Basra (1775-79) did not affect Kuwait.'' (p.183) Kuwait had its own identity through the Ottoman domination on the Arab world. This identity was clear to the British and the French who tried to win the support of Kuwait's Sheikh between 1793-95 when the British wanted his support in their conflict with the French in the Gulf area. --- Independent Kuwait This is the first of a series of articles that testify to the independence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the Ottomans. The following text is related to an expedition carried out by the Ottomans in 1871 against the Wahhabis in Eastern Arabia (where the oil fields in Saudi Arabia now). Kuwait and its ruler at that time, Sheikh Abdulla Ibn Sabah Ibn Jabir, allied themselves with the Turks:} Abdullah' role in the fighting was not a minor one. He joined the expedition as a commander of the large Kuwaiti fleet and was the first to use its guns against the besieged town of Al-Qatif. Had it not been for this bombardment by the Kuwaiti fleet, Al-Qatif obviously would not have surrendered in a mere three hours. In relation to this, a question arises as to why the Ottoman warships refrained from participating in the bombardment. The answer lies in reports relating to the political movements that preceded accounts of the progress of the expedition. Because the Ottomans were unwilling to jeopardize the maritime peace imposed by Britain in the area,  the Sultan and the Pasha promised their warships would not be used in the war against Su'ud or any Sheikh in the war zone. Kuwait, which was not a party  to the above-mentioned treaty of 1861, was under no such obligation especially since the expedition was not directed against those who had signed it. [ From the above text, we can see that Kuwait was not part of the Ottomans or the British colonies. For more details about the mentioned expedition, please check out the source of the above text: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, McGill University, Canada ] --- Independent Kuwait--2 This is another article of a series of articles that testify to the independence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the Ottomans. The following text discusses a dispute on an estate called Sufiyya in Zubair, Iraq, between the Sheikh of Kuwait and Al-Zuhair tribe in Zubair. In 1866, trouble developed over the possession by Sheikh Sabah of the estate which was [purchased] by his father, Sheikh Jabir, in 1836. This property was sequestered by a Turkish Qa'immaqam [representative] on the basis of a claim by the Al-Zuhair that the vendor had been the owner of a share and not of the n 100e Sufiyya. At the same time, Sheikh Sabah was required to expel from other lands owned by him at the island of Fao some cultivators who had immigrated from Persian territory. It should be recalled that  the Turkish officials from the start showed strong prejudice in favor of the Zuhair claimants. Abdulla Ibn Sabah,  the eldest son of the ruler of Kuwait who went to Basra as his father's agent in the case,  narrowly escaped being thrown  into jail upon his refusal to make a payment amounting to the value of seven years produce which the Ottoman authorities deemed the plaintiffs were entitled to receive. Eventually, the dispute was settled by the Wali [Governor] of Baghdad in favor of the Sheikh of Kuwait. The decision of the Governor of Basra in favor of the Sheikh was apparently made for various reasons. Some writers think that the Governor wanted to win Abdulla over to the Turkish side, and suggest that the Governor, Namiq Pasha, even offered him the title of Qa'immaqam, which he declined. Nevertheless,  the proceedings of the Turks in this case were regarded by the inhabitants of Kuwait as attempts to cause a confrontation with Zubair. It seems that they had anticipated a conflict and according to reports by the British Agent at Basra, the people of Kuwait were prepared to a man to abandon their town rather than submit to Turkish rule. Lorimer suggests that the final order of Namiq Pasha, upholding the Kuwait Sheikh's title to Sufiyya, was perhaps due to a report that Sheikh Sabah, ``with the object of attacking Zubair if the decision should go against him, had obtained a promise of countenance and armed support from the Wahhabi Amir.'' In addition to this legal matter with Zubair, Kuwait had had other problems with Basra whose courts tried to jail Abdulla Ibn Sabah, as explained above. However, Kuwait's relations with the Ottoman mutasallims of Basra had at times been amicable and in several instances, those mutasallims even sought refuge at Kuwait when pressured by the Pashas of Baghdad who exercised control over them. [ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, McGill University, Canada ] --- Independent Kuwait--3 This is another article that testifies to the independence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the Ottomans. When Pelly [Colonel Pelly, the British Resident in the Gulf] visited Kuwait for the first time on March 3, 1863, he was met at Jahra by Sheikh Mubarak, the second son of the ruler, Sheikh Sabah. Just before he reached Kuwait town on March 4, he was met by Sheikh Abdulla, the eldest son and heir apparent, who accompanied him to the town gate on their way to ``a very good home,'' which had been prepared for Pelly and his companions. ``Scarcely had we entered it,'' says Pelly, ``when Sheikh Sabah himself came.'' This description of Pelly's reception indicates that to a certain degree it was run according to protocol. The government system of Kuwait and administration of justice were the subject of comments made by Pelly. ``The Government is patriarchal,'' says Pelly, ``the Sheikh managing the political, and the Cazee [Qadi] the judicial departments. The Sheikh himself would submit to the Cazee's decision.'' Punishment was rarely inflicted. ``Indeed, there seems little government interference anywhere, and little need of an army.'' Pelly in admiration of how the Sheikh ran the affairs of the country, retold the following remark which the Sheikh had made to him: When my father was nearly 120 years old, he called me and said, ``I shall soon die. I have made no fortune, and can leave you no money, but I have made many and true friends, grapple them. While other states around the Gulf have fallen off from injustice or ill-government, mine has gone on [flourishing]. Hold to my policy, and though you are surrounded by  desert, and pressed by a once hostile and still wandering set of tribes, you will prosper.'' [ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, McGill University, Canada ] --- Independent Kuwait--4 This is another article that testifies to the independence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the Ottomans. The British had always regarded Sheikh Jabir as a ``good friend,'' but in October 1839, an event took place at Kuwait which could have weakened those good relations. On October 30, Lieutenant Edmunds, the Assistant Resident at Abu Shahr [in Iran], arrived in Kuwait on  a special mission from the Resident, Captain Hennell. His mission was to find out if Kuwait was willing to welcome the establishment of a British line of post across the desert from Kuwait to the Mediterranean. The British war vessel fired the usual salute in honor of the Sheikh after it had anchored in the waters of Kuwait Bay. The salute was not acknowledged and Edmunds waited in the vessel for three days before he was able to communicate with the Sheikh. After Edmunds' return to Abu Shahr, both he and Captain Hennell explained this unusual behavior of the Sheikh, to have been due not to ill-will, but principally to a desire to mislead the Egyptian agent at Kuwait as to the nature of his relations with the British. Therefore, they considered that Jabir's conduct did not indicate any change in his friendly policies towards the British. If the British tolerated the attitude of Jabir towards Edmunds, so also did the Egyptians. Earlier in the same year, some of the most wanted men in the Wahhabi camp, such as 'Umar Ibn 'Ufaisan, the Wahhabi general  in Al-Hasa, and Wahhabi tribes like Al-Duwaish, sought refuge in Kuwait. Protection of refugees seeking political asylum in his country was a policy that had been adopted earlier by Sheikh Abdulla Ibn Sabah. This can, therefore, be looked upon as an indication of self-confidence; an outcome of Kuwait's independence from foreign powers. It corroborates the fact that Kuwait, if necessary, was prepared to defend itself against more powerful neighbors. This defense depended not only on the walls of the city, but also on bedouin tribes in its neighborhood and a merchant fleet equipped with the necessary guns comparable to other Arab fleets of the time. As to Kuwait's position between 1815 and 1839, one can safely state that it managed to maintain a neutral policy with regard to the struggling Wahhabis and Egyptians. Relations with the British  and even with the Pasha of Baghdad continued on good terms. [ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, McGill University, Canada ] ---   They were trying to recover land they believed   was theirs, much like the Argentines in the Faulklands.  The Kuwaitis pushed   just a little too far by taking Iraqi oil and Saddam thought he'd settle   the dispute the old fashioned way... Are you really this cartoonish?  Or do you seriously believe this?  Ifso, please post  your proof.   Everybody would have been much better off had they left the reunited Iraq   together and concentrated on taking out Saddam.  A strong, united Iraq with   an elected government would have gone a long way to ridding the world of   the feudal dictatorships in the Gulf. Are standards at UWisc dropping?  Since when has Iraq *ever* had an"elected" government?

To one brought up, as most Americans have  been, in the Gladstonian and foreign-missionary tradition, the condition of  the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every  nation in the world would have treated as treasonable.

In 1941, while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration camps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of theformer guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of theshort-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920.An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of extermination of the Jews.This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an "encore"performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed andexterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.Furthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granteda respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the MudrosArmistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decidedto create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian provinceof Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatoliaclaimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia(around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as ithad already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly setabout attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, whocould be expected to oppose their plans. On April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilianand military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The Britishplanned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even though the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the British could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate ofthe Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlierin Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destructionof Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks ofKars to the mountains or south and west to the safety affordedby remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left the scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few Europeans were present to observe the genocide. One Britishsoldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise thedisarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring. Rawlinson wired to his superiors, "in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops  being without discipline and not being under effective control, atrocities were constantly being committed." >Instead, you post more Armenian nonsense:Come again?: "These European Dashnags, with headquarters in Berlin, appealed to...>(34 lines deleted)Why?: No wonder you are in such a mess.

 27WASHINGTON (UPI) -- A senior State Department official on Tuesdayruled out any softening of U.S. attitudes toward Iraq but said relationswith Iran's Islamic regime could improve substantially if thatgovernment disassociates itself from international terrorism.``Despite the name-calling and the harsh rhetoric from across theGulf, despite all this, we do not take a position of permanent hostilitytowards the Islamic Republic of Iran,'' David Mack, deputy assistantsecretary for Near Eastern Affairs, said.The primary U.S. objection is ``Iran's international behaviour''which includes ``extending support of violence'' to disrupt the ArabIsraeli peace process and its rapid build-up of dangerous weapons.Mack said ``Iran could contribute to regional stability and peace butfirst it is to end the behaviour which threatens this area.''Mack spoke at the U.S.-GCC business conference aimed at promotingGulf-American trade. He said the ``Middle East will be an item very highon the agenda of the U.S. administration.''The importance of the Gulf is underlined by Secretary of State WarrenChristoper's visit last year to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait before anywhereelse in the world, Mack said. He added that the U.S. has no long-termplan to station troops in the Gulf.Mack also insisted that the Clinton administration will continue topressure Iraq to ``comply with all the U.N. Security resolutions.''``As long as Iraq is ruled by Saddam Hussein we do not expectcompliance,'' Mack told delegates."Copyright 1993 by <UPI/Newsbytes>

As for 'Cyprus', In 1974, Turkiye stepped into Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population there. This is nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately, the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority.The problems in Cyprus have their origin in decades of oppression of the Turkish population by the Greek Cypriot officials and their violation of the co-founder status of the Turks set out in the constitution. The coup d'etat engineered by Greece in 1974 to execute a final solution to the Turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked Turkiye's intervention. Turkiye intervened reluctantly and only as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues consulting with Britain and Greece as the other two signatories to the treaty to protect the integrity of Cyprus. There simply was not any expansionist motivation in the Turkish action at all. This is in dramatic contrast to the Greek motivation which was openly expansionist, stated as 'Enosis,' union with Greece. Since the creation of independent Cyprus in 1960, the Turkish population, although smaller, legally had status as the co-founderof the republic with the Greek population.The Greek Cypriots, with the support of 'Enosis'-mindedGreeks in the mainland, have consistently ignored thatstatus and portrayed the Island as a Greek island witha minority population of Turks. The Turks of Cyprus arenot a minority in a Greek Republic and they found theonly way they could show that was to assert their autonomy in a separate republic.Turkiye is not satisfied with the status quo. She wouldrather not be involved with the island. But, given thedismal record of brutal Greek oppression of the Turkishpopulation in Cyprus, she simply cannot leave the fateof the island's Turks in the hands of the Greeks untilthe Turkish side is satisfied with whatever accordthe two communities finally reach to guarantee thathistory will not repeat itself to rob Turkish Cypriotsof their rights, liberties and their very lives.

The Russians usually treated the people  well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun. They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality problem.

I wonder whether US or other countries   would have risked themselves if only Jews were persecuted and   Hitler had no imperialist ambitions. (I am no student of history   and I am just asking questions.)I don't think they would have.  After all the U.S. was one of thecountries that turned away Jewish refugees when there was still timeto get them out.  (Considered and rejected at the Cabinet level then..)   ...   Under what conditions should US interfere in foregin countries,   is an abstraction one must clarify before resorting to acrimonious   accusations of religious bigotry and such.As I understand it, International law provides the right of anycountry to intervene to prevent genocide.  I think once the WorldCourt has ruled that genocide is being committed... If a Human Rights Czar is appointed at the U.N., we could haveinternational monitors recording events and responses of localofficials and develop an objective basis.  This could be backed byadjudication at the International Court of Justice and enforcementthrough a Rapid Deployment Force under the U.N. Secretary General'scommand.  I would like to see the U.N.  directly impose ICJ rulingswhenever feasible (without the possibility of vetos at the UN SecurityCouncil.. much as the President can't veto a U.S. Supreme Courtruling).  The U.S. is now supporting the effort to appoint the HR Czar -- thethird world opposition is led by three countries, China, Iran andPakistan (What company is Pakistan keeping!).  The U.S. is also reconsidering its opposition to the U.N. forceinitially envisaged in the Charter (although under the control of theSecurity Council).  The UN SC is quite a flawed body.  Roguegovernments like the PRC have even threatened their veto in the lastfew months to block the move to place U.N. troops in Bosnia underChapter 7 instead of 11 (if I have the numbers straight) where theycould have moved from being a monitoring to an enforcement forcewithout requiring further SC action.  (The PRC even continues tothreaten using its veto on U.N. action despite the ICJ ruling.  Thecurrent set-up requires the SC to enforce ICJ rulings..).Peace,Gul Agha

 47In 1941, while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Naziconcentration camps, the Nazi Armenians in Germany formed the firstArmenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of Dro (the butcher) who is the architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of extermination of the Jews.This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an "encore"performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed andexterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.Source: "Adventures in the Near East, 1918-1922" by A.

 105Today marks the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of2.5 million Turks and Kurds in Eastern Anatolia and x-SovietArmenia. The following letter, which represents a small portion of the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical documents, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs, was sent to President Bill Clinton, members of Congress, editors, program directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and radio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people. On April 23 of every year, the people of Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the lost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their lives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations may live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and prosperously.------------------------- letter ----------------------------------During the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day, Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland, which is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocidein order to shift international public opinion away from its politicalresponsibility.2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish Genocide.3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism throughthe ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-SovietArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence throughterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supportersof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community frommaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorialdemands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish peoplewill unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victimsof the Turkish Genocide demand:1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian Dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish andKurdish people;3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officiallyrecognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuseto succumb to all Armenian political pressure;5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of 2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in theefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new generation has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politicallymature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, throughall necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the armed struggle. Therefore, the victims of the Turkish Genocide call uponall Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in the political, cultural and religious activities of the 78th Anniversaryof the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

"Responsibility" is claimed by JCAG and SDPA.    May 4, 1982 - Cambridge, MassachusettsOrhan Gunduz, the Turkish honorary consul in Boston, would not bow to the Armenian terrorist ultimatum that he give up his title of "honorary consul". Now he is attacked and murdered in cold blood.President Reagan orders an all-out manhunt-to no avail. An eye-witness who gave a description of the murderer is shot down.  He survives... but falls silent. One of the most revolting "triumphs" in the senseless, mindless history of Armenian terrorism. Such a murder brings absolutely nothing - except an ego boost for the murderer within the Armenian terrorist underworld, which is already wallowing in self-satisfaction. Were you involved in the murder of Sarik Ariyak?    December 17, 1980 - SydneyTwo Nazi Armenians massacre Sarik Ariyak and his bodyguard, Engin         Sever. JCAG and SDPA claim responsibility.It is public knowledge that the founder of the Marxist-Leninist terrorist organization, the ASALA (an integral part of ASALA/SDPA/ARF), HagopHagopian, began his notorious career as a member of the terrorist group which perpetrated the massacre of the Israeli athletes at theMunich Olympics in 1972. And the 'Armenian Foundation' stole from the children of Turkiye to fund the criminal activities of the ASALA/SDPA/ARFterrorists in their cold-blooded murder of defenceless Turkish andKurdish people. THE ARMENIAN FOUNDATION PROVIDED 30 BILLION TL TO ASALA    01/09/92, MILLIYET-- The Armenian Foundation based inIstanbul is found to have provided 30 billion Turkish Lira ($6million) to the Armenian terrorist organization ASALA which havemurdered several Turkish diplomats abroad... Experts on international terrorism assert that the Armenian terroristsuse proceeds from drug trafficking (and from the Armenian Foundation)to fund their deadly enterprises. The deadliest of terrorist assassins,Carlos, proclaimed on Spanish television that his organization hadentered into a working relationship with Armenian terrorists and theyare using drug trafficking to raise money 'to continue' to slaughterinnocent people. Now, what is your personal and organizational role in this scheme?Recent reports which have been confirmed by the U.S. Administration, indicate that Armenian terrorist organizations are collaborating with those who are responsible for the bombing of the United States Marine barracks in Beirut.

I had mentioned before that there is a reportcommissioned by the UN to study the Litani river, it is still in draft form.  The Israeli gov't also commissioneda study on the river that was done by Dr. Ben Wolfe.The Litani starts in the Bekaa valley in Lebanon,flows Southward, then West across South Lebanon anddischarges into the Mediterranean near the city of Tyre.There are other rivers such as the Hasbani and the Wazzanithat start in Lebanese territory than join the Jordan river.  The most mentioned plan was one that would divert waterfrom the Litani into these, then the water would flownaturally into the Lac De Houle.  BUT there is no evidenceof any diversion structure (which would need to be at least3 km long).  The area is mountainous, inaccessible andoccupied by Israel so I have not seen any independent reports of the existence of any diversion structure there.Another often mentioned diversion is through deep wells.It is also rumored that Israe has 600 m wellstapping into deep aquifers and drawing water on theIsraeli side of the border.  If such wells are indeedunder use they would be costly to operate (high energy costs) and the Lebanese and Israeli gov't should agree on the distribution of water from shared aquifersas part of an overall peace plan and the bilateralnegociations on "regional issues".  The fact that we havebeen at war all this time has led to the current stateof affairs where withdrawals from such aquifers iscompletely unregulated.Basil|> |> Hasan |> |> -- |> Shai Guday              | Stealth bombers,|> OS Software Engineer    ||> Thinking Machines Corp. |the winged ninjas of the skies.|> Cambridge, MA           |

"It's justhysteria.  We have carried out blood tests, urine tests, every kind oftest we can think of and nothing has shown up."More than a thosand young girls between 12 and 18 have sufferedattacks in some 40 schools across the country since the first caseswere reported over two weeks ago.[...]Lawmakers and commentators have attributed the fainting to everythingfrom food posoning to a plot by unamed enemy agents to make Egyptianwomen infertile. Similar attacks have been reported from time to time through Europe.One was reported about a decade ago in the Israeli-Occupied GazaStrip. Islamic fundamentalist leaders have blamed the Israeli secret servicefor the spells.  "This is all the work of the Mossad," said a militantcleric in Imbaba, a Cairo slum.  "They are seeding capsules around thecountry that release something into the air that can't be detected.It has a special effect on the hormones of young girls.  It is part ofa plot to destroy Egypt."  [Where have seen this argument before?  Because there is no  evidence for the conspiracy, therefore it must be true...][...]Health Minister Ragheb Dewidar said that neither medical orenvironmental tests had found any contaminant and that the cause waspsychological.  "If one girl who is popular or a leader feels faintfor some reason," he said, "the others start believing that they aresuffering from the sypmtoms."But no one is taking the matter lightly.  Prime Minister Atef Sedkihas held regular mettings with Mr. Dewidar to discuss the attacks.Government officials say they are determined to bring the phenomenonto an end."Parents and teachers should fight against these rumors and accept theresults of our scientific analysis," Education Minister Hussein KamalBahadeen said.***********************************You can't make this stuff up.

 142[It looks like Yigal has been busy...]RTw  04/14 2155  JEWISH GROUP SUED FOR PASSING OFFICIAL INFORMATION    By Adrian Croft     SAN FRANCISCO, April 14, Reuter - Nineteen people, including the son offormer Israeli Defence Minister Moshe Arens, sued the Anti-Defamation League(ADL) on Wednesday, accusing the Jewish group of disclosing confidentialofficial information about them.     Richard Hirschhaut, director of the San Francisco branch of the ADL, artdealer Roy Bullock and former policeman Tom Gerard were also named as defendantsin the suit, filed in San Francisco County Superior Court.     The 19 accuse the ADL of B'nai B'rith, a group dedicated to fightinganti-Semitism, and the other defendants of secretly gathering information onthem, including data from state and federal agencies.     The suit alleges they disclosed the information to others, including thegovernments of Israel and South Africa, in what it alleges was a "a massivespying operation."     The action is a class-action suit. It was filed on behalf of about 12,000anti-apartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom theplaintiffs believe the ADL, Bullock and Gerard gathered information.     Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately availablefor comment on Wednesday.     The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations thatGerard, a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit, passedconfidential police files on California political activists to a spy ring.     The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL, Bullock andGerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL's offices in San Franciscoand Los Angeles.     The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California,which prohibits the publication of information obtained from official sources.It seeks exemplary damages of at least $2,500 per person as well as otherunspecified damages.     Lawyer Pete McCloskey, a former Congresmen who is representing theplaintiffs, said the 19 plaintiffs included Arab-Americans and Jews -- and hiswife Helen, who also had information gathered about her.     One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens, a research scientist at theUniversity of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli DefenceMinister.     Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept onhim in the 1980s, presumably because of his criticism of the treatment ofPalestinians and his position on the Israeli-occupied territories.     According to court documents released last week, Bullock and Gerard bothkept information on thousands of California political activists.     In the documents, a police investigator said he believed the ADL paidBullock for many years to provide information and that both the league andBullock received confidential information from the authorities.     No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case. The ADL, Bullock andGerard have all denied any wrongdoing.  REUTER AC KG CMAPn  04/14 2202  ADL LawsuitCopyright, 1993. The Associated Press. All rights reserved.By CATALINA ORTIZ Associated Press Writer   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Arab-Americans and critics of Israel sued theAnti-Defamation League on Wednesday, saying it invaded their privacy byillegally gathering information about them through a nationwide spy network.   The ADL, a national group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, intended touse the data to discredit them because of their political views, according tothe class-action lawsuit filed in San Francisco Superior Court.   "None of us has been guilty of racism or Nazism or anti-Semitism or hatecrimes, or any of the other `isms' that the ADL claims to protect against. Noneof us is violent or criminal in any way," said Carol El-Shaieb, an educationconsultant who develops programs on Arab culture.   The 19 plaintiffs include Yigal Arens, son of former Israel Defense MinisterMoshe Arens. The younger Arens, a research scientist at the University ofSouthern California, said the ADL kept a file on him in the 1980s presumablybecause he has criticized Israel's treatment of Palestinians.   "The ADL believes that anyone who is an Arab American ... or speakspolitically against Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite," Arens said.   The ADL has denied any wrongdoing, but couldn't comment on the lawsuitbecause it hasn't reviewed it, said a spokesman at the ADL's New Yorkheadquarters.   The FBI and local police and prosecutors are investigating allegations thatthe ADL spied on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups, includingwhite supremacist and anti-Semitic organizations, Arab-Americans, Greenpeace,the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and San Franciscopublic television station KQED.   Some information allegedly came from confidential police and governmentrecords, according to court documents filed in the probe and the civil lawsuit.No charges have been filed in the criminal investigation.   The lawsuit accuses the ADL of violating California's privacy law, whichforbids the intentional disclosure of personal information "not otherwisepublic" from state or federal records.   The lawsuit claims the ADL disclosed the information to "persons andentities" who had no compelling need to receive it. It didn't elaborate.   Defendants include Richard Hirschhaut, director of the ADL's office in SanFrancisco. He did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.   Other defendants are San Francisco art dealer Roy Bullock, an alleged ADLinformant over the past four decades, and former police officer Tom Gerard.Gerard allegedly tapped into law enforcement and government computers and passedinformation on to Bullock.   Gerard, who has retired from the police force, has moved to the Philippines.Bullock's lawyer, Richard Breakstone, said he could not comment on the lawsuitbecause he had not yet studied it.UPwe 04/14 1956  ADL sued for allegedly spying on U.S. residents   SAN FRANCISCO (UPI) -- A group of California residents filed suit Wednesdaycharging the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith with violating their privacyby spying on them for the Israeli and South African governments.   The class-action suit, filed in San Francisco Superior Court, charges the ADLand its leadership conspired with a local police official to obtain informationon outspoken opponents of Israeli policies towards the Occupied Territories andSouth Africa's apartheid policy.   The ADL refused to comment on the suit.   The suit also took aim at two top local ADL officials and retired SanFrancicso police officer Tom Gerard, claiming they violated privacy guaranteesin the state constitution and violated state confidentiality laws.   According to the suit, Gerard helped the ADL obtain access to confidentialfiles in law enforcement and government computers. Information from these fileswere passed to the foreign governments, the suit charges.   "The whole concept of an organized collection of information based onpolitical viewpoints and using government agencies as a source of information isabsolutely repugnant," said former Rep. Pete McCloskey, who is representing theplaintiffs.   The ADL's information-gathering network was revealed publicly last week whenthe San Francisco District Attorney's Office released documents indicating thegroup had spied on 12,000 people and 500 political and ethnic groups for morethan 30 years.   "My understanding is that they (the ADL) consider all activity that is insome sense opposed to Israel or Israeli action to be part of their responsbilityto investigate," said Arens, a research scientist at the University of SouthernCalifornia.   "The ADL believes that anyone who is Arab American...or speaks politicallyagainst Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite."   The FBI and the District Attorney's Office have been investigating theoperation for four months.   The 19 plaintiffs in the case include Arens, the son of former IsraeliDefense Minister Moshe Arens.   In a press release, the plaintiffs said the alleged spying had damaged thempsychologically and economically and accused the ADL of trying to interfere withtheir freedom of speech.

As usual, the bias of the 'Center for Policy Research' echoes    through this newsgroup.  Here we have an enraged Likudnik who    is venting his spleen, and you portray it as if this is going    to become policy.  You don't say what the response to Matza's    suggestion was.  Do do not mention whether he was refering to    terrorists caught in the act, which could be a clear cut case    of self-defence.  Would you care to elaborate on this, or was    this all you wanted to say on the matter.  Why don't you give    up this 'Center for Policy Research' crap, and just post your      biases without trying to legitimize them with a pompous name?>Ha'aretz, 16 March1993:>>Today a private security firm and units from the IDF Southern>Command will begin installation of four magnetic gates in the Gaza>strip, as an additional stage in the upgrading of security>measures in the Strip.>>The gates will aid in the searching of [non-Jewish] Gaza residents>as they leave for work in Israel.

And it's not only the incidents    that you do not mention, but even the stories you do post are    fraught with omissions, which change the entire meaning.  The    absurdity of your respectable name cannot hide your bias.    In your effort to portray Israel in an unfavorable light, you     have accomplished nothing, except to prove that a respectable     sounding label like the Center for Policy Research is nothing     but a smoke screen for someone with a heavily biased attitude     against Israel and the need to vent it.

We can get back to the question of which law should be used in the territories later. Also, you have not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights.   What do you expect me to tell you, Master of Wisdom, when I did explain my   point in the post, that you "responded to". The point is that since Israel    is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights    to the Occupied Palestineans, which is exactly similar the automatic    deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society.If a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions, then tell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all?   |> |> In conjugtion with the above, when a group of people occupies others    |> |> territories and rule them by force, then this group would be -willingly or    |> |> unwillingly- deprived from some of its rights.    |> Such as the right to live?

The question is NOT which system would solve the ME problem. Why ? because   any system can solve it.    The laws of minister Sharon says kick Palestineans out of here (all palestine). I asked for which system should be used, that will preserve human rights for all people involved. I assumed that was obvious, but I won't repeat that mistake. Now that I have straightened that out, I'm eagerly awaiting your reply.   Joseph Weitz (administrator responsible for Jewish colonization)    said it best when writing in his diary in 1940:   "Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both   peoples together in this country.... We shall not achieve our goal^^^                  ^^^   of being an independent people with the Arabs in this small country.   The only solution is a Palestine, at least Western Palestine (west of   the Jordan river) without Arabs.... And there is no other way than   to transfer the Arabs from here to the neighbouring countries, to   transfer all of them; not one village, not one tribe, should be    left.... Only after this transfer will the country be able to   absorb the millions of our own brethren. There is no other way out."   DAVAR, 29 September, 1967   ("Courtesy" of Marc Afifi)Just a question: If we are to disregard the rather obvious references to getting Israel out of ME one way or the other in both PLO covenant and HAMAScharter (that's the english translations, if you have other information I'dbe interested to have you translate it) why should we give any credence to a _private_ paper even older? I'm not going to get into the question if hewrote the above, but it's fairly obvious all parties in the conflict havetheir share of fanatics. Guess what..? Those are not the people that willmake any lasting peace in the region. Ever. It's those who are willing to make a tabula rasa and start over, and willing to give in order to get something back.   "We" and "our" either refers to Zionists or Jews (i donot know which).    Well, i can give you an answer, you Master of Wisdom, I will NOT suggest the    imperialist israeli system for solving the ME problem !   I think that is fair enough .No, that is _not_ an answer, since I asked for a system that could solve the problem. You said any could be used, then you provided a contradiction.Guess where that takes your logic? To never-never land.    "The greatest problem of Zionism is Arab children".   -Rabbi Shoham.Oh, and by the way, let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end area real bummer, when I try giving your posts any credit.----------------------------------------------------------Jonas Flygare, + Wherever you go, there you areV{ktargatan 32 F:621+754 22 Uppsala, Sweden+

That's the whole point 'paliks' invariably miss.

Thatis, $3,000 - $5,999. Source: 'International Economics: Theory and Policy' by Paul R.        Krugman and Maurice Obstfeld, Harper Collins Publishers,        1991, (second edition).In terms of 'Annual Output Per Person in Dollars Adjusted to Purchasing Power Parity,' Greece is in the same category with Turkiye.Indeed, Greek Governments have enormous problems to tackle. The economy is in shambles, corruption is rampant, air pollution is in outrageous dimensions, state-sponsored terrorism is the name of the game and infrastructure is decaying. Another insightful article in the New York Times (Sunday, April 7) exposes the dirty linen of Greece, and describes her as the pariah of the European Community. The article reports that ''...with un-European antics,Greece uses the Community as a cash register. She squanders, andat times even steals the European tax payers' money for political  featherbedding at home. The principal members of the Communityadmit that it was a mistake to accept Greece to the EuropeanCommunity.'' This affirmation is testimony to the fact thatnotwithstanding her geographic location, Greece is un-Europeanin mentality and attitude. Indeed, during the last 12 years, Turkiye registered a great success with regard to economic restructuring. A sound economy, ready to be integrated to the world economies, has emerged, succeeding to the faltering one, witnessed in the '70s.Just 12 years ago, Greece used to export double as much as Turkiye did. Now inversely, Turkiye's overall exports exceed by far that of Greece. As far as the tourism incomes are concerned, we are witnessing the same phenomenon.The governments in Turkiye have put a particular emphasis on the infrastructure investments (rather than investing inworld terrorist organizations), thereby solving this issue completely. Indeed, in the '70s, it was out of the question to conduct a telephone call from Eastern Anatolia to the West. Nowadays, this is not the case at all, and in a far remote town, even in a village you may have, at any time, a long-distance call to any given country.However, the same could not be applied to Greece. In fact,it is not so easy in Athens to have a trunk call to Germanyround the clock. And if you happen to be in the Greek islands,then your chance will be pretty slim. Therefore, it would notbe an exaggeration to argue that Turkiye is far ahead of Greece in regard to telecommunication facilities. Greece,by virtue of its full membership, has enjoyed all advantagesof the EC, obtaining huge grants and extensive subsidies. Turkiye, having no access at all to similar financial supports,has nevertheless managed to create a better economy which enabled it to produce consecutive current accounts surplusover the last two years. As such, Turkiye deserves to be theonly country in its region having permanent current accountssurplus.

The fact is>that the Croat govt. using their secret police (called the Ustache, I think)>were the prime agents of the Nazis in Yugoslavia against the Serbs.> Actually, just after the FIRST world war, many Muslims were killed by Serbs.Under Serbian-led regime between the two world wars, many Croats werealso killed (especially during the dictatorship introduced on Jan. 6, 1929).Some Croats formed a resistance movement "Ustashas" (Insurgents) andwere forced into exile, to fascist Italy, which sheltered them.  In exile,they practiced a terrorist approach to liberating Croatia; while Croats inCroatia followed the approach of peaceful negotiations under the leadershipof Vladko Macek.  After the Axis powers took control in the SECOND worldwar, Vladko Macek refused to collaborate, so Ustashas were brought in to run the newly formed puppet state.  This state included both Croatia andBosnia-Herzegovina, and its ideology saw Muslims as the best Croats("flowers of Croatian people").  Some Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovinatherefore joined Ustashas.  However, even more others did not; theyjoined Tito's Partisans.    The Ustashas membership peaked at less than 1% of Croat and Muslim population of that area at that time.After WWII, Muslims were still considered a religious minority descendedfrom Croats or Serbs who converted to Islam centuries ago.  But, in 1968,it was decided that forcing Muslims to declare their nationality aseither Serbs or Croats is not a good policy.  Dobrica Cosic, the currentpresident of the rump Yugoslavia, was strongly opposed, and sought toprevent the category "Muslim" (in an ethnic sense) from appearing on thenext census.  He was criticized and expelled from the party.  So, sincethat time, Bosnian Muslims are considered a separate nationality, althoughsome still deny this and insist that they choose either Serb or Croatnationality.Sincerely,Josip

 18My recollection of History/Documentary books is slitely different.It is my understanding that Croats were allies of Germany duringWWII, while Serbs had sided with Russia.  As a result Serbs didtake a beating from Croats (NOT Bosnian Moslems) while Germanyhad the upper hand.Even today, Russians consider/call Serbs as their Slovac brothers.This is one of the issues involved in the U.N.'s lack of activeintervention against Serbs.As for the Bosnian Moslems, I have not heard of any alliance withGermany or Russia in recent history.  Therefore, I am curiousif they did or were able to treat other parties in this conflictwith same brutallity (as they are getting it today) in the pasthistory.Regards;Ramin Moshiri
 7While one may question the motives of the Arabs who sold land to Jews,often while publicly criticizing the sale of land to Jews, it was theJews and not the Arabs who were taken advantage of, as the prices theJews paid for barren land was many times the price fertile land wasbeing sold for in the United States at the same time.-- Alan H.

Here are some questions I have to ask for anyone to answer. My pointis what someone said long time ago: In politics, like with men, it is importantto distiguish between what they say they do and what they are actuallydoing.1) My mother is Jewish (and so is my father). If I apply for the Law ofReturn, do I get in as a Jew trying to return to his land, from which myfamily was expelled about 2000 years ago?2) If I go back, which nationality would my ID show?3) If I decided to go back to the land from which my relatives had been expelled 2000 years ago, but first I convert to any other religion, can I apply to the law of Return as a member of the Jewish Nation or should I apply as someone whose mother is Jewish?4) Which nationality would show my ID in case 3)?5) What has change in me between the day before and the day after I convertedto loose my being part of the Jewish Nation?6) Suppose I want to get married to my current wife, who is non-Jewish inIsrael, how do I do it?7) How would my situation change if I decided, after going back toIsrael, to convert to Islam?Now, here is one more question. I do believe that most people in a countrydo not care about politics. They just want to be left alone.Suppose my father is Arab. Suppose he was born in Palestine, in some place which now is part of Israel. Suppose that his father, and his grandfather aswell as 20 or 30 generations before him were born in that place.Now suppose there is a war of independence and my father, scared by all thefighting going on, tries to take his family to a place more secure, among people he knows, who speak a language he understands, who worship the samegod. Now, suppose that that place is some other Arab country. And, now suppose that the war is over and that there is a new country createdwhere my father used to live, and that that country is called Israel.And, that in that country, Jews from all over the world are received. Andthat people whose family left thet country 200 generation ago are recieved andgranted full-citizenship.Should I, if I decided to go back to my father's land, where he was born as20 or 30 generations of my family were born, have the right to go back andask to be recognized in the same way those who are returning after 2000years?Then, finally, people ask me how I would define a Jew, but that is irrelevant.I am not talking about how I would define a Jew, but about how people in Zionist organizations, and more important, in Israel, define a Jew.How would those who are Zionist define a Jew? >>>     Eric S.

If youwant to know about events in Palestine it makes more sense to get the newsdirectly from the source. EVERY news source is inherently biased to someextent and for various reasons, both intentional and otherwise. However, the more sources relied upon the easier it is to see the "truth" and to discern the bias. Go read or listen to some Israeli media.

The only question becamethe question of price and other quantitative detail. The best thing the Palestinians can do for themselves these days is to stop the Intifadaand try to live as normally as possible (I know, it's hard under occupation).Otherwise people might think that five years of stone throwing (as justifiedas it may be) has caused the Palestinians an irreversible damage that prevents them from running a normal state when the time comes.

BBdoes not properly speak for me nor many of the people around me who sharemy views.>>What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in, as far as I can get from the Arab media,>is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic>Law. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in>Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants.>What 1948 situation?  A negative situation I presume?  Is this the same"situation" when the Jordanian occupiers of East Jerusalem would not allow theJews to go worship at the HOLIEST SITE IN JUDIASM?  Was this an example ofQu'ranic law being exercised?  If not, I have another suggested reading foryou... get into the "soc.culture.arabic" newsgroup where the posters have beendebating the topic "Jews in the Qu'ran" (and may I remind you the people doingthe debating appear to be devout Muslims with some knowledge of the Qu'ran).You will find that Jews aren't really viewed positively by the Qu'ran (to putit lightly).  So how do you think Jews (or any other non-Islamic religion) willbe treated by an Islamic state governed by the words of the Qu'ran?  I thinkthe 1948-1967 "situation" in Jerusalem will return *at best*!  What do youthink?>However, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their>homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political>thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the>Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.All I have to say to that is, once again, see s.c.a - "Jews in the Qu'ran" andthink again.  "Freedom of choice" is *definitely* not an option in Qu'raniclaw especially for non-Muslims and ALL women!  Remember the Gulf War?  I'm sureyou saw the reports about how women had few rights in Saudi Arabia (an Islamicstate).>>As for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind.>Probably nothing!

 57From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>Subject: Arab H.R. Assoc.,NazarethThe Arab Association for Human RightsP.O. Box 215Nazareth, 16101 IsraelPhone (972)-6-561923Fax (972)-6-564934The Arab Association for Human Rights (HRA) was formed in 1988 to address discriminatory practices and human rights abuses by Israel against its Palestinian citizens.It is a unique association concerned with the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of the Palestinian national minority in Israel. Among the issues of concern are land confiscation, education, prison conditions, unemployment, torture and the unequal allocation of Israel's resources.Today there are around 800,000 Palestinian Arabs living within the Green line (the pre-1967 borders of Israel), constituting 18% of Israel's citizens. For them it is an empty citizenship in a system geared exclusively for the needs of the Jewish population. Legally and practically, Israel has proclaimed itself a Jewish state and early promises of equality for non-Jewish citizens have not been fulfilled. This is apparent in many areas strongly affecting the Palestinian national minority.Most Arab agricultural land has been confiscated since 1948. The Arab sector is vastly underfunded and does not receive a fair share of state resources. On a day-to-day level, Palestinians face discrimination in many different forms and find it is a struggle to get permission to build a house, start a business, find a job or educate their children.ACTIVITIES- Monitoring civil, economic, cultural and human rights abuses of Palestinians within the Green Line.- Taking carefully selected test cases to court.- Providing legal advice and assistance to lawyers in the Occupied Territories.- Educating the Palestinian public as to their rights and methods of mobilization.- Conducting public campaigns on local and international levels.- Researching and publishing pertinent publications.

 92In article <1993Apr25.015551.23259@husc3.harvard.edu> verbit@brauer.harvard.edu (Mikhail S. Verbitsky) writes:>Actually, Jarmo is a permanent resident of my killfileAnyone care to speculate on this? I'll let the rest of the net judgethis on its own merits. Between 1914 and 1920, 2.5 million Turks perished of butchery at the hands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only the killing of innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian Armenia. They were persecuted, banished, and slaughtered while much of Ottoman Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines genocide as acting with a   'specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a    national, ethnic, racial or religious group.' History shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate the Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the Armenians. International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time - including U.S. Ambassador Bristol - denounced the x-Soviet Armenian Government's policy as a massacre of the Kurds, Turks, and Tartars. The blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the extermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor those who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians. The eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established,beyond any doubt, that the massacres against the Muslim peopleduring the war were planned and premeditated. The aim of the policywas clearly the extermination of all Turks in x-Soviet Armenian territories.The Muslims of Van, Bitlis, Mus, Erzurum and Erzincan districts andtheir wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed.The massacres in Trabzon, Tercan, Yozgat and Adana were organized andperpetrated by the blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian Government.The principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims wereDro, Antranik, Armen Garo, Hamarosp, Daro Pastirmadjian, Keri,Karakin, Haig Pajise-liantz and Silikian.Source: "Bristol Papers", General Correspondence: Container #32 - Bristol         to Bradley Letter of September 14, 1920."I have it from absolute first-hand information that the Armenians in  the Caucasus attacked Tartar (Turkish) villages that are utterly  defenseless and bombarded these villages with artillery and they murder the inhabitants, pillage the village and often burn the village."Sources: (The Ottoman State, the Ministry of War), "Islam Ahalinin Ducar Olduklari Mezalim Hakkinda Vesaike Mustenid Malumat," (Istanbul, 1918).

When the Russian army withdrew, a part of the remaining people was destroyed in Armenian massacres and cruelties: they were thrown into wells, they were locked in houses and burned down, they were killed with bayonets and swords, in places selected as butchering spots, their bellies were torn open, their lungs were pulled out, and girls and women were hanged by their hair after being subjected to every conceivable abominable act. A very small part  of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to. Including women and children, such persons discovered so far do not exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in Erzurum. All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled, everything that the people had has been taken away from them, and we found them in a destitute situation.

Why and on what basis are you reassuring me in|> the face of 50 years of discriminatory practise?Quite simply, if all eligible Arab voters became members of the Laborparty and voted, they would be able to command more than %15 ofthe delegates.  This is a power base that can not be ignored!Especially when they are not ranked high in the party (once againdue to lack of political power).  I have seen how the labor partyworks from the inside and my experience has been that, as in mostpolitical situations, the MKs act out of their own self-interest.And to answer your question, I "broke" with labor because I feltthat they were heeding too much to the right-wing and ultra-orthodoxcoalition members.|> >From "The OTHER Front", July 29, 1992.

Demirok disclosed that PKK has three safe houses in South Cyprus, used by terrorists such as Ferhat. In the camps, he added, terrorists were trained to use various weapons including RPG's and anti-aircraft guns which had been purchased directly from the Greek government. Greek Cypriot government has gone to the extent of issuing special identification cards to PKK members so that they can travel from one region to another without being confronted by legal obstacles. Demirok's account was confirmed by another PKK defector, Fatih Tan, who gave himself over to police in Hakkari after spending four years with PKK. Tan explainedthat the terrorists went through a training in camps in South Cyprus, sometimes for a period of 12 weeks or more.

"Abu Nidal's Advisers" Reportedly Training                  "PKK & ASALA Militants" in Cyprus       Nicosia, Ankara,  Tel Aviv. The Israeli  secret service,       Mossad,  is   reported  to  have   acquired  significant       information in connection  with the camps set  up in the       Troodos  mountains   in  Cyprus  for  the   training  of       militants of the PKK and ASALA {Armenian Secret Army for       the Liberation  of Armenia}. According to  sources close       to Mossad, about 700 Kurdish, Greek Cypriot and Armenian       militants  are   undergoing  training  in   the  Troodos       mountains in  southern Cyprus.  The same  sources stated       that Abu  Nidal's special  advisers are  giving military       training to  the PKK and  ASALA militants in  the camps.       They added that the  militants leave southern Cyprus for       Libya, Lebanon, Syria, Greece  and Iran after completing       their training.  Mossad has established that  due to the       clashes  which were  taking  place  among the  terrorist       groups based  in Syria, the PKK  and ASALA organisations       moved to  the Greek Cypriot  part of Cyprus,  where they       would  be  more  comfortable. They  also  transferred  a       number of  their camps in  northern Syria to the Troodos       mountains.       Mossad  revealed that  the  Armenian National  Movement,       which is known as the MNA, has opened liaison offices in       Nicosia, Athens and  Tripoli in order to  meet the needs       of the  camps. The offices are used to provide  material       support for the  Armenian  camps. Meanwhile, the  leader       of the  Popular Front for  the Liberation of  Palestine,       George  Habash, is  reported  to  have ordered  his  men       not  to   participate  in  the  operations  carried  out       by  the  PKK &  ASALA, which  he  described  as "extreme       racist,  extreme  nationalist  and   fascist."  Reliable       sources have said that  Habash believed that  the recent       operations carried  out by the PKK  militants  show that       organisation  to  be a  band  of  irregulars  engaged in       extreme  nationalist  operations.  They  added  that  he       instructed  his militants  to sever their links with the       PKK  and avoid clashing with it. It has been established       that George Habash  expelled ASALA  militants  from  his       camp  after ASALA's  connections  with  drug trafficking       were exposed.Source: Alan Cowell, 'U.S. & Greece in Dispute on Terror,' The New        York Times, June 27, 1987, p. 4.

 143Here is a press release from the White House. Text of President Clinton's Letter to Congress on Iranian Assets To: National Desk Contact: White House Press Office, 202-456-2100   WASHINGTON, May 14  -- Following is a letterPresident Clinton wrote to Congress on Iranian Assets:  TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:       I hereby report to the Congress on developments since the  last Presidential report on November 10, 1992, concerning the  national emergency with respect to Iran that was declared in  Executive Order No. 12170 of November 14, 1979, and matters  relating to Executive Order No. 12613 of October 29, 1987.  This report is submitted pursuant to section 204(c) of the  International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c),  and section 505(c) of the International Security and Development  Cooperation Act of 1985, 22 U.S.C. 2349aa-9(c).  This report  covers events through March 31, 1993.  The last report, dated  November 10, 1992, covered events through October 15, 1992.       1.  There have been no amendments to the Iranian  Transactions Regulations ("ITRs"), 31 CFR Part 560, or to the  Iranian Assets Control Regulations ("IACRs"), 31 CFR Part 535,  since the last report.       2.  The Office of Foreign Assets Control ("FAC") of the  Department of the Treasury continues to process applications  for import licenses under the ITRs.  However, as previously  reported, recent amendments to the ITRs have resulted in a  substantial decrease in the number of applications received  relating to the importation of nonfungible Iranian-origin goods.       During the reporting period, the Customs Service has  continued to effect numerous seizures of Iranian-origin  merchandise, primarily carpets, for violation of the import  prohibitions of the ITRs.  FAC and Customs Service investi-  gations of these violations have resulted in forfeiture actions  and the imposition of civil monetary penalties.  Additional  forfeiture and civil penalty actions are under review.       3.  The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal (the  "Tribunal"), established at The Hague pursuant to the Algiers  Accords, continues to make progress in arbitrating the claims  before it.  Since the last report, the Tribunal has rendered  12 awards, for a total of 545 awards.  Of that total, 367 have  been awards in favor of American claimants:  222 of these were  awards on agreed terms, authorizing and approving payment of  settlements negotiated by the parties, and 145 were decisions  adjudicated on the merits.  The Tribunal has issued 36 decisions  dismissing claims on the merits and 83 decisions dismissing  claims for jurisdictional reasons.  Of the 59 remaining awards,  3 approved the withdrawal of cases, and 56 were in favor of  Iranian claimants.  As of March 31, 1993, awards to successful  American claimants from the Security Account held by the  NV Settlement Bank stood at $2,340,072,357.77.       As of March 31, 1993, the Security Account has fallen  below the required balance of $500 million 36 times.  Iran has  periodically replenished the account, as required by the Algiers  Accords, by transferring funds from the separate account held by  the NV Settlement Bank in which interest on the Security Account  is deposited.  Iran has also replenished the account with the  proceeds from the sale of Iranian-origin oil imported into the  United States, pursuant to transactions licensed on a case-by-  case basis by FAC.  Iran has not, however, replenished the  account since the last oil sale deposit on October 8, 1992.  The aggregate amount that has been transferred from the Interest  Account to the Security Account is $874,472,986.47.  As of  March 31, 1993, the total amount in the Security Account was  $216,244,986.03, and the total amount in the Interest Account  was $8,638,133.15.       4.  The Tribunal continues to make progress in the  arbitration of claims of U.S. nationals for $250,000.00 or more.  Since the last report, nine large claims have been decided.  More than 85 percent of the nonbank claims have now been  disposed of through adjudication, settlement, or voluntary  withdrawal, leaving 76 such claims on the docket.  The larger  claims, the resolution of which has been slowed by their  complexity, are finally being resolved, sometimes with sizable  awards to the U.S. claimants.  For example, two claimants were  awarded more than $130 million each by the Tribunal in October  1992.       5.  As anticipated by the May 13, 1990, agreement settling  the claims of U.S. nationals for less than $250,000.00, the  Foreign Claims Settlement Commission ("FCSC") has continued its  review of 3,112 claims.  The FCSC has issued decisions in  1,201 claims, for total awards of more than $22 million.  The  FCSC expects to complete its adjudication of the remaining  claims in early 1994.       6.  In coordination with concerned Government agencies,  the Department of State continues to present United States  Government claims against Iran, as well as responses by the  United States Government to claims brought against it by Iran.  In November 1992, the United States filed 25 volumes of  supporting information in case B/1 (Claims 2 & 3), Iran's claim  against the United States for damages relating to its Foreign  Military Sales Program.  In February of this year, the United  States participated in a daylong prehearing conference in several other cases involving military equipment.  Iran also  filed a new interpretative dispute alleging that the failure  of U.S. courts to enforce an award against a U.S. corporation  violated the Algiers Accords.       7.  As reported in November, Jose Maria Ruda, President of  the Tribunal, tendered his resignation on October 2, 1992.  No  successor has yet been named.  Judge Ruda's resignation will  take effect as soon as a successor becomes available to take up  his duties.       8.  The situation reviewed above continues to involve  important diplomatic, financial, and legal interests of the  United States and its nationals.  Iran's policy behavior  presents challenges to the national security and foreign  policy of the United States.  The IACRs issued pursuant to  Executive Order No. 12170 continue to play an important role  in structuring our relationship with Iran and in enabling  the United States to implement properly the Algiers Accords.  Similarly, the ITRs issued pursuant to Executive Order No. 12613  continue to advance important objectives in combatting inter-  national terrorism.  I shall exercise the powers at my disposal  to deal with these problems and will report periodically to the  Congress on significant developments.                         WILLIAM J.

People will think you're just some looney howling in the wires. If you think that this 'clears things up' for me or anyone else, you must also believe that aliens from outer space come to earth regularly and abduct 'Arromdians' of ASALA/SDPA/ARF for medical experiments. There is stronger evidence for *that* you know.'Propagandist leaflets'? This is an American officer on the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people by the Armenians between1914 and 1920, not a crook/idiot like yourself.Source: "World Alive, A Personal Story" by Robert Dunn. Crown Publishers, Inc., New York (1952). (Memoirs of an American officer who witnessed the Armenian genocide of 2.5  million Muslim people)p. 361 (seventh paragraph) and p. 362 (first paragraph). 'The most are inside houses. Come you and look.' 'No, dammit! My stomach isn't-' 'One is a Turkish officer in uniform. Him you must see.' "We were under those trees by the mosque, in an open space.... 'I don't believe you," I said, but followed to a nail-studded door. The   man pushed it ajar, then spurred away, leaving me to check on the corpse.   I thought I should, this charge was so constant, so gritted my teeth and   went inside. The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes, and was dark at first, for  its stone walls had only window slits. Rags strewed the mud floor around an  iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black  with soot. All looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. As  the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face  up, naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what  was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted,  as with Tartars rather than with Turks. Any uniform once on him was gone, so  I'd no proof which he was, and quickly went out, gagging at the mess of his   slashed genitals."p. 363 (first paragraph).  'How many people lived there?' 'Oh, about eight hundred.' He yawned. 'Did you see any Turk officers?' 'No, sir. I was in at dawn. All were Tartar civilians in mufti.' "The lieutenant dozed off, then I, but in the small hours a voice woke me -  Dro's. He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. Anyone keelhauled so long and furiously I'd never heard. Then abruptly Dro broke into  laughter, quick and simple as child's. Both were a cover for his sense of guilt, I thought, or hoped. For somehow, despite my boast of irreligion, Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would have been. From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around..... The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel's chattels, the last  scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags,  looms, even spinning-wheels. 'Thank you for a lot, Dro,' I said to him back in camp. 'But now I must  leave.'...We shook hands, the captain said 'A bientot, mon camarade.' And  for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains.  Like Lot's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all, doubtless in  a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran.'"p. 354."At morning tea, Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole high region called the Karabakh. Deep in tactics, they spoke Russian, but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust of promises made by tribal chiefs. A campaign shaped; more raids on Moslem villages."p. 358."It will be three hours to take," Dro told me. We'd close in on three sides."The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets," Merrimanovsaid, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow."That is for morale," Dro put in. "We must keep the Moslems in terror.""Soldiers or civilians?" I asked."There is no difference," said Dro. "All are armed, in uniform or not.""But the women and children?""Will fly with the others as best they may."p. 360."The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. Hundreds of feet  down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that,' said  Dro, pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.' Then, 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling; then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though  I heard our Utica brass roar. As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed, dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly. The came a shrill wailing. Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot. 'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries. At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and  tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly, through alders, on smoldering houses. Across trampled wheat my brothers-in- arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb."p. 361 (fourth paragraph)."Corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair,  large eyes. She looked about twelve years old. She lay in some stubble  where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. The bayonet  had gone through her back, I judged, for blood around was scant. Between  the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun  dress. The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He  lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the  pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed  just below his neck, into the spine.  There were grownups, too, I saw as I led the sorrel around. Djul was  empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's German-speaking  colonel. He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead."p. 358. "...more stories of Armenian murdering Turks when the czarist troops fled  north. My hosts told me of their duty here: to keep tabs on brigands,   Turkish troop shifts, hidden arms, spies - Christian, Red or Tartar -  coming in from Transcaucasus. Then they spoke of the hell that would   break loose if Versailles were to put, as threatened, the six 'Armenian'  vilayets of Turkey under the control of Erevan...  An Armenia without Armenians! Turks under Christian rule? His lips  smacked in irony under the droopy red moustache. That's bloodshed - just  Smyrna over again on a bigger scale."Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

All Muslims knew that the whole thing was set up to destroy Iraq, not   to "Liberate Kuwait", The people who were killed by the invasion are   more (many many more), than the ones that were killed by the Iraqis   in their smaller invasion. I lived in the west, and I have seen how   your media prepared you (helpless naive Americans) for a war against                                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ No doubt you plan on exploiting "helpless naive Americans" for your ownpurposes. Hmm...let's see:   Iraq even before the artificial conflict between Iraq and Kuwait that   led to the invasion, as the CIA correctly predicted (and pretended to   be surprised not to know).   It just happened that Saddam was so predictible and so arrogant and stupid.   What would I have done: Most Muslims would choose 300 dead Kuwaitis   over   200,000 dead Iraqis and 1000 dead Kuwaitis. The first case would happen   if no western intervention happened, and the second case was a direct   or indirect result of western envolvement. Possibly, if 200,000 Iraqis had indeed died, but this number is based onGreenpeace estimates.  Greenpeace had compromised its allegedimpartiality during the war by condemning the potential environmentalconsequences of Allied miiltary action, while initially *completely*ignoring Iraq's horrible environmental crimes, starting with the dumpingof millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf at Ahmadi to the blowing ofover 700 oil wells.  What is the real number?  There has been a lot ofwork on this in the last two years, none of it reported as theGreenpeace figure seems to get continuously bandied about.  The realnumber seems to be around 10,000, on the same order as the number ofKuwaitis killed, tortured and kidnapped during the occupation.  I'veincluded an article I recently posted below, but this is really oldnews.  Independent Television News reported a figure around 15,000 onlya few months after the war, but it was hardly reported. For the Allies to have killed 200,000 Iraqis, they would have had tokill twice the *total* number of Iraqis in Kuwait. The favored image of the hysterics is the last battle of the war atMutla'.  This was yet another example of the American and European mediaplaying into the hands of Iraq and its de facto allies.     Thedestruction of the Iraqi convoy at Mutla' was portrayed as an all-outslaughter.  This is simply not true.  The head and tail of the convoywas bombed initially, resulting in a lot of casualties at these points.  Before bombers came back, most of the rest of the Iraqi soldiers fledon foot. Furthermore, your estimates of Kuwaiti war dead if Allies hadn't invadedis completely ridiculous.  You have acknowledged (certainly implicitly)  that Saddam is a barbarous brute.  You have acknowledged the hundredsof thousands he has been responible for killing *in his own country*. You *know* that the man he appointed as governor of Kuwait,  Ali Majid,was his most brutal henchman, presiding over the near genocide of theKurds  in the late 80's and, more recently, the Shi'a.    Yet, when itcomes to his treatment of Kuwaitis, he is an angel.  In your estimate,he would've killed *fewer* than he already had when the war started. What a joke! APn  03/09 0006  Iraq War Dead Copyright, 1993. The Associated Press. All rights reserved. By NICK LUDINGTON  Associated Press Writer    WASHINGTON (AP) -- After the Persian Gulf War ended, the world wastold that as many as 100,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed. At one point, even Baghdad put the toll that high, as did the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency in private.    But U.S. officials have been backpedaling ever since, even though the Pentagon has yet to settle on an official estimate to release to the public. Now, one former DIA analyst says the number of Iraqi troops killed mayhave been as low as 1,500.    That conclusion by John Heidenrich, writing in the current issue of the quarterly magazine Foreign Policy, represents the lowest estimate yetfrom U.S. defense sources.    The revisions suggesting a less devastating Iraqi toll fit a pattern of vastly moderated U.S. military claims in the months after the war ended.Claims for a number of U.S. weapons also were scaled down.    Despite the dramatic videotapes of successful weaponry or the shocking pictures of Iraq's disastrous retreat from Kuwait, arguments have continued unabated about what really happened in the Gulf War.    Heidenrich is not the first to question the Iraqi death toll numbers that originally were aired. More that a year ago, Air Force Lt. Gen. CharlesHorner, the commander of the air campaign in the Gulf War, said he believed the Iraqi military death toll was fewer than 10,000 for the entire war.    The Pentagon itself still refuses to provide an estimate of the number of Iraqis who died in the 42-day war against the U.S.-led coalition inJanuary and February 1991. On Monday, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Joe Gradisherreiterated past statements that "there just isn't a number," that is credible.    But some current internal estimates range from 8,000 to 25,000 Iraqi troops killed, said one analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity, who is familiar with the Pentagon's reports.    Allied deaths were put at 146 Americans, 35 by friendly fire; 24 British, 9 by American fire; 2 Frenchmen, 1 Italian and 39 among various Arab allies.    Of the postwar reassessments, the most widely publicized was the Army's reluctant acknowledgement, months later, that its touted Patriot air defense system was nowhere near so effective as claimed against Iraq's Scud missiles. The Bush administration initially claimed an almost perfect record for the Patriot; last spring it revised the hit ratio to 60 percent.    The success record of the Navy's Tomahawk high-tech cruise missile used against targets in Baghdad and other parts of Iraq also turned out to be more modest than initially indicated by the Pentagon.    The first Iraqi casualty figures to surface after the war came in aMay 1991 report by the environmental group Greenpeace, which said 100,000 to 120,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed. It estimated that 5,000 to 15,000 Iraqi civilians were also killed.    The same month, published reports said the Defense Intelligence Agency estimated 100,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed and 300,000 wounded in theair and ground campaigns -- although the agency qualified that by saying the estimate could be off by as much as 50 percent in either direction.    But as more information became available, those figures gradually were revised downward.    The House Armed Services Committee staff estimated 9,000 dead and 17,000 wounded after a review last year.    But Heidenrich, writing in the current issue of the quarterly ForeignPolicy, estimated the total death toll from both the air and ground offensivesas low as 1,500 -- with about 3,000 wounded.    Heidenrich based the conclusion in his article on the number ofbodies found and buried by U.S. troops -- 577 -- and on prisoner of war interviews.He noted that only about 2,000 of 69,000 Iraqi prisoners of war were wounded.    Based on the calculation that about half as many wounded escaped as were captured, he put the number of wounded at about 3,000. Using a conservative ratio of one dead to two wounded, applicable to Third World armies likeIraq, he set battlefield deaths at 1,500.    "Maybe the figures are too low," he wrote. "Maybe the real death tollon the battlefield was 2,000 or 3,000 or even 6,000. Even then, the evidencesuggests a death toll of well below 100,000 -- or even 10,000."    In an interview, he said the 100,000 figure was obviously off basebecause it would mean that virtually all the Iraqi soldiers in the Kuwait theater of operations were casualties.    He said today's bloodiest wars were not those fought with high technology, but rather the drawn-out conflicts such as those in Yugoslavia and Somalia.

Coming from a self-exposed historical revisionist, a self-admitted anti-Muslim and a genocide apologist, Hamaza should take your drivel as a compliment. Furthermore, you even deny the obvious. There was a genocide of the Muslims carried out by order of the fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government. Massacres of Muslims must be studied in detail, because they are the first modern example of the horrible crime of genocide. Blame must be apportioned to the Armeniansand their supporters for the murder of Muslims. The Turkish historic homeland, emptied of its native population until today, remains occupied by the x-Soviet Armenian Government. Today, x-Soviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against humanity. x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds.The following are the Jewish and Armenian sources on the cold-bloodedgenocide perpetrated by the x-Soviet Armenian Government against 2.5million Muslim people between 1914 and 1920.

Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of Ottoman territories.

The estimated population of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem. Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the  Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897, however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character  notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian  Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the  southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia."

Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts  into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable  and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets  completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They  found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border  into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole  length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to  Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain  plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of  Tartar villages.

These memoirs    include an interview between Aharonian and British Foreign Minister    Lord Curzon in which above-mentioned genocide was discussed. The    official report mentioned by Lord Curzon is the report of British    High Commissioner to Caucasia, Sir Oliver Wardrop.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

But I also feel that when a culture feels it is confronted by another group that wishes to see that culture "disassembled", the firstculture has little choice but to *try* to secure its "survival" as well asmaintain its moral center. Since the culture is not about to turn awayfrom *either* the matter of its survival or the valuing of its moral principles, it has the virtually impossible job of "balancing". To discuss Israel's faults and "crimes" without *any* recognition of thiscircumstance and *reality* it faces is a conscious decision based on the discussant's political biases, NOT on an honest and empathetically open understanding of the situation. The same applies to those who attempt to paint the Palestinian movement as "all bad" and dispense with considerations of the *reality* facing them.>>>That certainly describes Elias, >>since he has no intention of recognizing that, alongside the Palestinian>>experience and perspective, there exists also that of Israelis. >>He might not want to recognize that.

Let's take a little   stroll through a few of Elias Davidsson's contributions to our    understanding of the middle east. ED> Quotations from Zionist leadersED> 1. "There was no such thing as Palestinians"ED> (Golda Meir, Prime Minister of Israel, London Sunday ED> Times, 15 June 1969)    And what do suggest that she meant by this?  Do you think she    meant that the Palestinians don't exist?

They are not all Jews now.  No    Jew but the most rabid bigot has ever called for an Israel to    be ONLY for Jews.  That was true then.  It is true now.  ED> "[The Palestinians are] beasts walking on two legs."ED> (Menachem Begin, Prime Minister of Israel in a speech to ED> the Knesset,ED> quoted in Amnon Kapeliouk, 'Begin and the "Beasts", New ED> Statesman, 25 June 1982)    Since you inserted the words 'The Palestinians are' we cannot    know what Begin was talking about.          For someone who wants to embellish his own importance with an     absurd pseudo-organizational name like the 'Center for Policy    Research,' you are not a very honest person. ED> "Both the process of expropriation [of the Palestinians] ED> and the removal of the poor must be carried out ED> discreetly and circumspectly".ED> (Dr. Theodor Herzl, The Complete Diaries, Herzl Press, ED> 1960, I., p.88)    Herzl died eighty nine years ago.  Are you suggesting that he    has stated what is Israel's policy today?  Have you ever seen    Israel even entertain a policy to exclude non-Jews, let alone      actually try to remove non-Jews from Israel?  If you actually     believe that this quote has anything to do with Israel's non-    Jewish citizenry today, you are an idiot.  But if you realize    that Israel has no intention of removing non-Jewish Israelis,    then you are nothing but a common liar.  This one time I will     give you the benefit of the doubt, and assume you are stupid.  ED> "We shall try to spirit the penniless population [the ED> Palestinians] across the border by procuring employment ED> for it in the transit countries, while denying it any ED> employment in our own country"ED> (Theodor Herzl, The Complete Diaries, Herzl Press, 1960, ED> I, p.88)    Once again you quote a man gone for almost a century.  You do    so within the context of modern day Israel.          Thomas Jefferson owned slaves.  How does this fact define the    United States today?ED> "[Jews] must expel Arabs and take their place" ED> (David Ben Gurion, 1937, quoted in Shabtai Teveth, Ben ED> Gurion and the Palestine Arabs, Oxford University Press, ED> 1985, p. 89)    Did he say 'Jews,' or did you add this?     This was also a statement from ten years before Israel became    a state.  It has no bearing on Israel.      ED> "We must do everything to ensure they [the ED> Palestinian refugees] never do return"ED> (David Ben Gurion, in his diary, 19 July 1948, quoted in ED> Michael Bar Zohar, Ben Gurion: The Armed Prophet, ED> Prentice-Hall, 1967, p.157)    YOU added the words 'the Palestinian refugees.'  And by doing    so, you are misleading people into believing that Ben Gurion,    who was expressing his hope that people who fled their lands,    at the encouragement of people such as KING ABDULLAH, and the      MUFTI OF JERUSALEM, was gloating over people abandoning their    homes.

And    what was thought of and described as terrorism by Jews didn't    include slaughtering Olympic athletes, brutally murdering the     innocent, attacking school buses, and murdering another human     being for the sole reason that he or she is an Arab.  ED> "The domination of Jewish agriculture by Arab ED> workers is a cancer in our body"ED> (A.

Obviously times change.  This    is NOT what Israel is about today.  I believe the peace talks    make this quote irrelevant.ED> "There is not a single Jewish village in this country ED> that has not been built on the site of an Arab village"ED> (Moshe Dayan, Ha'aretz, 4 April 1969...)

And since Israel has not annexed ANY land at     all since 1967, you are once again wasting bandwidth with all    of these misleading quotes.  They are so out of sync with the    reality of Israel, that you do nothing but make yourself look    like a fanatic desperate to sway people, by misleading them.ED> "Let us not today fling accusations at the [Palestinian ED> Arab] murderers.

It's true that we should never lose sight    of the plight of these people.  We should also recognize that    this quote preceded the disgusting wave of Arab terrorism and    violence directed at innocent people, that began in 1972 with     the massacre of the Israeli athletes in Munich, and continues     to this day.    If your ability to obscure was the equal of your desire to do    so, truthseekers in this group would have a problem.  But you    are an easily recognized fanatic, whose stream of misleading,    partial, and out-of-context quotes are totally  unfettered by    the burden of truth.

The Negev in the Year 2000Just after the creation of the State of Israel, the phrase "theJewish pioneers will make the desert bloom" was trumpetedthroughout the Western world. After the Six Day War in 1967, DavidBen-Gurion declared in a letter to Charles de Gaulle: "It's by ourpioneering creation that we have transformed a poor and arid landinto a fertile land, created built-up areas, towns and villages inabandoned desert areas".Contrary to Ben-Gurion's assertion, it must be affirmed thatduring the 26 years of the British mandate over Palestine and forcenturies previous, a productive human presence was to be found inall parts of the Negev desert - in the very arid hills and valleysof the southern Negev as well as in the more fertile north. Thesewere the Bedouin Arabs.The real desertification of the Negev, mainly in the southernpart, occurred after Israel's dispossession of the Bedouin'scultivated lands and pastures. Nowadays, the majority of the12,800 square-kilometer Negev, which represents 62 percent of theState of Israel (pre-1967 borders), has been desertified beyondrecognition. The main new occupiers of the formerly Bedouin Negevare the Israeli army; the Nature Reserves Authority, whose chiefrole is to prevent Bedouin from roaming their former pasturelands; and vast industrial zones, including nuclear reactors anddumping grounds for chemical, nuclear and other wastes. IsraeliJews in the Negev today cultivate less than half the surface areacultivated by the Bedouin before 1948, and there is no Jewishpastoral activity.I. Agricultural and pastoral activities of the Negev Bedouinbefore and after 1948-------------------------------------------------- In 1942,according to British mandatory statistics, the Beershebasub-district (which corresponds more or less to Israel's Negev, orSouthern, district) had 52,000 inhabitants, almost all BedouinArabs, who held 11,500 camels, 6,000 cows and oxen, 42,000 sheepand 22,000 goats.The majority of the Bedouin lived a more or less sedentary life inthe north, where precipitation ranged between 200 and 350 mm peryear. In 1944 they cultivated about 200,000 hectares of theBeersheba district - i.e. 16 percent of its total area and *morethan double the area cultivated by the Negev's Jewish settlersafter 40 years of "making the desert bloom"*The Bedouin had a very low crop yield - 350 to 400 kilograms ofbarley per hectare during rainy years - and their farmingtechniques were primitive, but production was based solely onanimal and human labor. It must also be underscored that animalproduction, although low, was based entirely on pasturing.Production increased considerably during the rainy years anddiminished significantly during drought years. All Bedouin pastureanimals - goats, camels and sheep - had the ability to gain weightquickly over the relatively rainy winters and to withstand manywaterless days during the hot summers. These animals were theresult of a centuries-old process of natural selection in harshlocal conditions.After the creation of the State of Israel, 80 percent of the NegevBedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan. The10,000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of40,000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150mm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years outof three. The rare water wells in the south and central Negev,spring of life in the desert, were cemented to prevent Bedouinshepherds from roaming.A few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev.But after 1982, when the Sinai was returned to Egypt, theseBedouin were also eliminated. At the same time, strong pressurewas applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fieldsin order that the land could be transferred to the army.No reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land heldtoday by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part ofthe 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seizedby the Israeli authorities. Indeed, most of the Bedouin are nowconfined to seven "development towns", or *sowetos*, establishedfor them.(the rest of the article is available from Elias Davidsson, email:elias@ismennt.is)

You should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion ondistortions propagated by several of your contemporaries. If you feel that you can simply act as an Armenian governmental crony in this forum you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed. This is not a lecture to another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist, but a fact.I will dissect article-by-article, paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line, lie-by-lie, revision-by-revision, written by those on this net, who plan to 'prove' that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds is nothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide. We are neither in x-Soviet Union, nor in some similar ultra-nationalist fascist dictatorship, that employs the dictates of Hitler to quell domestic unrest. Also, feel free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists,the Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armeniancriminal organizations.x-Soviet Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. You, and those like you, will not get away with the genocide's cover-up.During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920, the Armenians through a premeditated and systematic genocide, tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their 1,000 year homeland.The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instanceof Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.This event is incontrovertibly proven by historians, governmentand international political leaders, such as U.S. Ambassador Mark Bristol, William Langer, Ambassador Layard, James Barton, Stanford Shaw, Arthur Chester, John Dewey, Robert Dunn, Papazian, Nalbandian, Ohanus Appressian, Jorge Blanco Villalta, General Nikolayef, General Bolkovitinof, General Prjevalski, General Odiselidze, Meguerditche, Kazimir, Motayef, Twerdokhlebof, General Hamelin, Rawlinson, AvetisAharonian, Dr. Stephan Eshnanie, Varandian, General Bronsart, Arfa,Dr. Hamlin, Boghos Nubar, Sarkis Atamian, Katchaznouni, Rachel Bortnick, Halide Edip, McCarthy, W.

Greek Efforts to Decimate the Jewish Population of Salonica             Culminated in 1912 and 1913  <<Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled  particularly to Salonica, whose Jewish population increased substantially  as a result, from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908, more than half the  total population, though even there increased persecution by local Greeks  led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, particularly to  the great port of Izmir.  Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike, the ritual  murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on. Greek  efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912  and 1913, following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War,  when many of its Jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>>  <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow  Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to  practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923  which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday, stimulating a new  Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a  series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where  most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This  was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting  Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also  on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica  for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By  killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a  substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting  Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the  occupation of Greece starting in 1941.  Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for  Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.  Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received  thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by  the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in  flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained  independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the  Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during  and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements  in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among  its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim  refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the  Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly  to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as  800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and  east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more  came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-  1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,  with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the  Empire.>>[47] Robert Mantran, 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de  Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle', RH no.534 (1980), 391-92;  Nehama VII, 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2,  12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775, 10 January 1900 (AIU  Archives I-C-41), describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek  children in the streets of Salonica.

Just a simple question....with a simple answer![EE] As far as I know most of the Armenians belong to the Gregorian Orthodox[EE] faith and such was the case in nineteenth century Ottoman Empire. It is[EE] also known that some Armenian communities were converted into Catholicism[EE] and Protestantism by the Western European missionaries in this period. The vast majority of Armenians in eastern Anatolia were Gregorian or ArmenianApostolic. There was, however, a higher percentage of non-Gregorian Armenians in Cilicia, closer to the Mediterranean, in Adana, Marash, Aintab, etc.  [EE] Another known fact is that almost half of the Armenians living in Anatolia[EE] did not speak any Armenian, but used Turkish in their everyday lives.This is not true. While it was forbidden for Armenians to speak Armenian incertain areas of Cilician Armenia, most all Armenians spoke Armenian. In fact,Turks who interacted with Armenians also spoke Armenian! For sure, most allArmenians, especially men, also knew Turkish in order to function in larger society.[EE] My question is, given so many separations in the Armenian community, what[EE] was the common denominator of the Armenian people that allowed Armenian[EE] nationalism to emerge in the nineteenth century? As I stated, religion[EE] was not uniform (unlike the Greeks) and many Armenians couldn't even speak[EE] Armenian. I would like to know what factors brought the Armenians in the[EE] Ottoman Empire together and led to the formation of an Armenian [EE] consciousness.The Armenians in Turkey were persecuted because they were Armenian, regardlessof the specific branch of Christianity they professed. The resultant Armeniannationalism was in direct reaction to this persecution. Even at the later stages of WWI, and after the genocide, many Armenians who were converted to Islam were also exterminated because they continued as Armenian Moslems. This practice continued well into the 1920s by Ataturk in parallel with the policy of clearing out pockets of steadfast Islamic fundamentalism. Many of theseconverted Armenians, ironically, in order to stay alive, were staunch Moslems. [EE] Any information will be appreciated.You answered your own question! The common thread throughout your inquirywas the word Armenian![EE] Regards,-- David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | "Armenia has not learned a lesson inS.D.P.A.

How can you  have the gall to even open your mouths about >Karabakh, until Turkish troops are  completely out of the independent >island of Cyprus.No wonder you 'wieneramus' are in such a mess. Following the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with the aid of the Greek army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right given by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently and conveniently forgotten people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For those Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island since 1571. And the next is'Karabag'.The people of Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sentits troops on July 15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimategovernment of Archibishop Makarios.The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organizationof Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should notforget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turksin Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried todestroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Ofcourse, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences for this irresponsible conduct.             THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM2 Irfan Bey Street, Kumsal Area, Nicosia, CyprusIt is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major who  was serving atthe Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launchedagainst the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. NihatIlhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutallykilled in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savageGreeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocitiescommitted during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house whichhas been converted into a museum.AN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BYGREEK TERRORISTSThe date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of theGreeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has beengoing on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old menand children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now KumsalArea of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savagebloodshed...The wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, amajor on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent,are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  thebathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into theirhome. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.Let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told byMr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was woundedduring the same terrible event."On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasanand I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan.Our neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs.Ayshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sittinghaving supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos Riverdirection started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain.Thinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  wasdangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thoughtwould be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid inthe bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. Wewaited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standingin the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in herarms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open.Greeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the housewith  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heardvoices saying, in  Greek, "You want Taksim eh!"  and then bulletsstarted flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three childrenfell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks,who broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. Iheard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted.When I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan andher three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of theneighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But whathad happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran tothe  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  wasbrutally murdered.In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying"Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?"  I became terrified. Ithought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was notdead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myselfunder the double-bed.An our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. Mymouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank somewater. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to thebathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There Ioffered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber whowere all wounded.We  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  Ithought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and neededto be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novberand I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walkedas far as Koshklu Chiftlik.There, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we wereoperated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that therewere more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs.Ayshe and her daughter.After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane toAnkara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  monthstreatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus,Greeks arrested me at the Airport.All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during mydetention. They then released me."ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTERWe went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia inwhich 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last fivedays.We  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  someterrible sights.In the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our wayinto  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  Achild's bicycle lay in a corner.In the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were threechildren piled on top of their murdered mother.In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in thehead.This, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whosefamily had been killed by the mob in the first violence.Today was five days later, and still they lay there.Rene MacCOLL and Daniel McGEACHIE, (From the "DAILY EXPRESS")"...I saw in  a bathroom the bodies of a  mother and three infantchildren murdered because their father was a Turkish Officer..."Max CLOS, LE FIGARO 25-26 January, 1964Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

Because, the unspeakable crimes of the Armenians must be righted. Armenian invaders burned and sacked the fatherland of Urartus, massacred and exterminated its population and presented to the world all those left from the Urartus, as the Armenian civilization.All reliable Western historians describe how Armenians ruthlesslyexterminated 2.5 million Muslim women, children and elderly people of Eastern Anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of the Ottoman Empire between 1914-1920.It is unfortunately a truth that Armenians are known as collaboratorsof the Nazis during World War II and that, even today, criminal/Nazimembers of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle preach and instigateracism, hatred, violence and terrorism among peoples. And x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocidein order to shift international public opinion away from its politicalresponsibility.2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle and criminal/Nazi Armenians, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish Genocide.3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism throughthe ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-SovietArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence throughterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supportersof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian government is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community frommaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian government and its terroristand revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle of those whose closest ones were systematically exterminated by the Armenians,the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

Armenian invaders burned and sacked the fatherland of Urartus, massacred and exterminated its population and presented to the world all those left from the Urartus, as the Armenian civilization. All reliable western historians describe how Armenians ruthlessly exterminated 2.5 million Muslim women, children and elderly people of Eastern Anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of the Muslim people between 1914-1920. It is unfortunately a truth that Armenians are known as collaborators of the Nazis during World War II and that, even today, criminal members of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle preach and instigate racism, hatred, violence and terrorism among peoples. >Please tell me how on earth Armenians fully participated in the genocide >of Jews during WWII, are you on some heavy drugs?  Who says 'Arromdians' are no damn good? During World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and cringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication in Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1]"Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews) when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it  becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing." Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews -extracts from a letter dated December 11, 1983, published in the SanFrancisco Chronicle, as an answer to a letter that had been publishedin the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian. "We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities  against our people (Jews). Members of our family witnessed the   murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum, Turkey, by Armenian   neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish   and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see   the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors.  Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise   to grant themselves government if, in return, the Armenians would   help exterminate Jews. Armenians were also hearty proponents of  the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists."  Signed Elihu Ben Levi, Vacaville, California.[1] James G. Mandalian, 'Dro, Drastamat Kanayan,' in the 'Armenian    Review,' a Quarterly by the Hairenik Association, Inc., Summer:    June 1957, Vol. X, No. 2-38.And stick around...Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

 104From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>Subject: Help Palestinian educationHOW TO HELP PALESTINIAN EDUCATION(From 'Educational Network', No. 11, April 1993,publ. by Ramallah Friends Schools, P.O.Box 66, Ramallah, West Bank, via IsraelTel. 972-2-956230,  Fax. 972-2-956231)Many of our readers have written to us asking how individuals and organizations can help Palestinian education. We have compiled a list of suggestions to guide you. If you are interested in pursuing one or more of these suggested activities, the Educational Network can aid you by /coordinating/ the initial contacts, /following up/, and /providing any other support/ you may need.1.  Link your teachers' union with a teachers' union here --- linkage should be based on a shared pedagogical enterprise.2. Get your union to actively support the right of Palestinian teachers in the Occupied Territories to form unions:a. through the International Labor Organization (if your union is a member)b. contacting other international unions which have supported our right to form a union -- we can supply names and addresses.3. Establish a SCHOLARSHIP FUND for one or more Palestinian students to study at a Palestinian university or school -- or establish a scholarship fund for a Palestinian student or teacher to study at a university abroad.4. Reproduce and publish information about Palestinian education:    a. for your union membership;    b. for the outside community.The Educational Network can supply up-to-date information and statistics.5. Send delegations of teachers to visit the Occupied Territories during periods when our schools are in session.The Network can arrange an itinerary, make hotel and local travel arrangements, and provide a guide for the visit.6. Sponsor Palestinian teachers to visit your city for an educational tour:      a. to see schools and speak with educators in order to          learn about progressive pedagogical ideas and           experiences;      b. to speak about the conditions of Palestinian          education.The Network will coordinate from Palestine.7. Establish teacher-exchange programs for one year in which a Palestinian teacher from a private school teaches at a public or private school abroad while a teacher from that school spends a year in a Palestinian private school.8. Send an experienced educator to the Occupied Territories to give workshops (all-day workshops or two-day workshops) on innovative teaching techniques.The Network will pay for the person's food, lodging, and travel while in Palestine, and will serve as guide.9. Set up a pen-pal program with a Palestinian school in either English or French.10. Set up a sister-school program with a Palestinian school which would actively involve teachers as well as students at both schools -- a great tool for building international understanding and mutual sensitivity.11. Keep the Educational Network informed about important educational conferences so that we can send a Palestinian teacher to attend.12. Send to the Educational Network articles or other writings or books dealing with innovative approaches and ideas in the field of education so that we can then disseminate the information locally.13. Support an educational development project in the Occupied Territories.

Deir Yassin was an unprovoked attack on   the part of the Jews, and a massacre defines it best in my   opinion.  The village of Deir Yassin had had a pact with the   Jews, a peace pact, but the Irgun purposely broke this   agreement in order to scare off the Palestinians.  I might   grant that this village housed armed Arabs [I doubt it] but   nothing in the archives and available literature indicates that   this was a motivating force amongst the Irgun.  The Deir Yassin   MASSACRE was part of an over all strategy to intimidate the   Palestinians to flee the Jewish Homeland.,...and contrary to   your belief, many civilians were killed.  Deir Yassin was later   advertized by the very Jews who perpetrated it because it was   useful in getting many Palestinians to leave.  The Palestinians   were rightfully scared off, because they did not want another   Deir Yassin.     I'm not necessarily condemning the Israelites here;   atrocities were aslo committed on the part of the Arabs.   Israelophiles should just be careful in thinking that they are   and were the good guys in the middle east.  Both Arab and Jew   suck equally.rj3s, you say that there is no evidence that what motivated the Irgunto attack Dir Yassin was its strategic importance. In fact, Begin,who was in charge of the Irgun, wrote that Dir Yassin was attacked forits military significance.Dir Yassin was merely a battle in the War of Liberation.

 692                           THE ENEMY WITHIN                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                        By Robert I. Friedman         The Village Voice, May 11, 1993, Vol. XXXVIII No. 19        | How The  Anti-Defamation League  Turned the Notion |        | of Human Rights on Its Head, Spying  on  Progress- |        | ives and  Funneling Information to Law Enforcement |Roy Bullock wanted to be a spy since he was a teenager in Indiana andread "I Led Three Lives," Herbert Philbrick's Cold War saga ofpenetrating the Communist Party for the FBI.  Philbrick had become anAmerican folk hero in the 1950s for building dossiers on unsuspectingcolleagues.  It was a time when Hollywood produced more than 30 filmsportraying the informer as the quintessential American patriot.  InBoston, where Philbrick led three lives as an FBI informant, CommunistParty member, and private citizen, the mayor even proclaimed a HerbertPhilbrick Day and presented the spy with a plaque.For Bullock, a shy young man who was coming to terms with hishomosexuality in the straight-arrow '50s, the life of a double agentwas the perfect way to hide his lifestyle while fighting the Communistmenace."I was fascinated with Herbert Philbrick," Bullock recently toldfederal investigators, "and so I thought I would try to infiltrate theCommunist Part.  In 1957, I went to the Sixth World Youth and StudentFestival in Moscow with the American delegation.  I gave them [the FBIa full report on it when I returned, along with some photos I took ofsome Soviet military vehicles."Bullock was hooked.  For the next two years, he worked as an unpaidinformant for the FBI.  But he found his true calling when he became apaid spy for the Anti-Defamation League in 1960.  Now his activitiesare at the center of the biggest domestic spy scandal in recentAmerican history -- a scandal that may end with the ADL's criminalindictment in San Francisco.Over a 30-year period, he compiled computer files for the ADL on 9876individuals and more than 950 groups of all political stripes,including the NAACP, the Rainbow Coalition, ACLU, the American IndianMovement, the Center for Investigative Reporting, Pacifica, ACT UP,Palestinian and Arab groups, Sandinista solidarity groups, Americansfor Peace Now, and anti-apartheid organizations.  Bullock, who evenspied on the recently slain South African nationalist Chris Hani whenhe visited the Bay Area in April 1991, sold many of his ADL files onanti-apartheid activists to South African intelligence.  Meanwhile,between 1985 and 1993, the ADL paid him nearly $170,000, using aprominent Beverly Hills attorney as a conduit in order to conceal itsfinancial relationship with Bullock.Last month, police raided ADL offices in Los Angeles and SanFrancisco, as well as Bullock's home, confiscating computer files andboxes of documents.  According to court records, Bullock's filescontained the driver's license and vehicle registration information,in addition to criminal histories on individuals -- much of which wasallegedly stolen from the FBI and police computers.  Bullock, 58, toldthe FBI that copies of virtually everything in his computer data basehad been given to the San Francisco ADL office.  "Based on theevidence," says Inspector Ron Roth, in a police affidavit, "I believethat Roy Bullock and ADL had numerous peace officers supplying themwith confidential criminal and DMV information."What's more, the San Francisco D.A. is investigating Bullock fortapping phones, accessing answering machines, and assuming falseidentities to infiltrate organizations.  Documents seized fromBullock's home also contained evidence of his forays into Bay Areatrash cans: He had the names and phone numbers of employees at theChristic Institute in San Francisco, as well as telephone messageslips to staff members (including names and phone numbers of callers),office correspondence listing the names and return addresses of thesenders, and inter-office memos.  He also had receipts from ChristicInstitute's bank accounts at Wells Fargo and Eureka Federal Savings,as well as itemized canceled checks with the names of the payees, thedates, and amounts.  Bullock even knew the balance in the ChristicInstitute's checking account.Investigations by the FBI and police in San Francisco have revealedthat the ADL has shared at least some of its spy gathering materialwith Israeli government officials.  What's more, Israel apparently usedtips from the ADL to detain Palestinian Americans who travelled there.                            *     *     *The ADL was established in New York City in 1913 to defend Jews, andlater other minority groups, from discrimination.  It led the fightagainst racist and fascist groups like the Ku Klux Klan and theAmerican Nazi Party, and in the 1960s championed the civil rightsmovement.But there was also a darker side.  In the late 1940s, the ADL spied onleftists and Communists, and shared investigative files with the HouseCommittee on Un-American Activities and the FBI.  The ADL swungsharply to the right during the Reagan administration, becoming abastion of neoconservatism.  To Irwin Suall, a repentant Trotskyitewho heads the ADL's powerful Fact Finding Department, the real dangerto Jews is posed not by the right -- but by a coalition of leftists,blacks, and Arabs, who in his view threaten the fabric of democracy inAmerica, as well as the state of Israel.  In the tradition of hisideological soulmate William Casey, Suall directed the ADL's vastnetwork of informants, who were given code names like "Scumbag,""Ironside," and -- for a spy reportedly posing as a priest in Atlanta-- "Flipper."For years, journalists and liberal members of the Jewish communityknew the ADL spied on right-wing hate groups.  As long as the targetswere anti-Semitic organizations like the Liberty Lobby and LyndonLarouche, no one seemed to be particularly troubled.  But the Bullockcase reveals that the ADL also spied on groups that have a nonviolent,and progressive orientation.  This apparent massive violation of civilliberties may end with the ADL's criminal indictment in San Francisco,where the investigation began.  The human rights group faces possiblecriminal prosecution on as many as 48 felony counts, including anindictment for gaining illegal access to police computers.  Says onesource close to the West Coast investigation, "It is 99 per centcertain that the ADL will be indicted."In the wake of the San Francisco investigation, police probes of ADLspying are spreading to other parts of the country.  "We have receivednumerous complaints about ADL [spying]," says Sam Adams, aspokesperson for the mayor's office in Portland, Oregon.On April 16, the Harlem-based Black United Fund of New York, andAfrican American self-help group that Bullock allegedly spied on,wrote District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, requesting "an immediateinvestigation" of the ADL.  "The ADL's actions cause great concern, asit is a direct and flagrant violation -- at minimum -- of our civilrights....We call upon you to join with the District Attorney of SanFrancisco to...bring and end to this latest form of McCarthyism."Gerald McKelvey, a spokesperson for Morgenthau's office, says, "Wehave no evidence before us that warrants any sort of investigation."McKelvey adds that Morgenthau offered to assist the FBI and the SanFrancisco D.A.'s office on their pending investigation.  "They havenot, so far, asked for our assistance."The ADL acknowledges sharing information on violence-prone groups withlaw enforcement officials.  It also admits to maintaining extensivefiles on a wide variety of organizations, but says, in a two-pagepress release, "The vast majority of ADL's files are composed of newsclips, magazine articles, books, journals, and other documents....""ADL has made it clear that it does not and will not countenanceviolations of the law on the part of anyone connected with the agency,and the process by which the League gathers information is presentlyunder review to insure that no laws are being violated."That's what the ADL says for public consumption.  But morale is so lowthat its employees complain of sleepless nights and crying fits.  Andeven as other Jewish groups circle the wagons around the ADL in a showof solidarity, many do so holding their noses.  More than a few Jewishofficials privately say the ADL has to decide whether it is a humanrights group or a secret police agency."The ADL is regarded both inside the Jewish community and outside theJewish community as the definitive source of information on anti-Semitism and extremist groups," says Daniel Levitas, the formerexecutive director of the Center for Democratic Renewal, an Atlanta-based group that monitors anti-Semitism, racism, and hate groups."One of the things this scandal has done is that it has completelytainted the ADL's credibility and reputation with regard to itsobjectivity.  This scandal is going to be a devastating blow to theJewish community at large because people regard the ADL as synonymouswith American Jewry."                            *     *     *Bullock's talents as a snoop and his extreme conservatism meshed wellwith the ADL's Cold War worldview.  In 1960, he moved to SouthernCalifornia where he became an ADL spy for $75.00 a week.  Bullockalmost always used his real name when snooping, although he oncecalled himself Elmer Fink when corresponding with supporters ofAlabama governor George Wallace.  Bullock provided the ADL's office inLos Angeles with written reports, which were transmitted to FactFinding Department head Irwin Suall, according to court records.Under Suall's stewardship, Fact Finding Department had become theADL's heart and soul.  Located at ADL national headquarters acrossfrom the United Nations, the department had assembled a vast libraryon "hate groups," culling material from publications, speeches, andinformants reports.Bullock was more than adept at leading a double life.  Not long aftermoving to California, he ingratiated himself with a woman in the JohnBirch Society who helped him gain access to the group's Boston office.There, he found a file the right-wingers were keeping on the ADL.  Thediscovery gave rise to speculation in the ADL New York office thatthey had somehow been penetrated by the Birchers.Bullock focused almost exclusively on right-wing extremist groupsuntil the early 1970s when ADL L.A. head Milton Sinn was replaced byHarvey Schechter, who encouraged him to target the left as well.  Afew years later, Bullock moved to the Castro District in San Franciscowhere he posed as an art dealer.  And ADL fact finder who hadinfiltrated the local Arab community had just been exposed.  When theensuing scandal died down, Bullock was ordered by the ADL to penetratethe Arabs.The ADL was especially concerned about the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, founded by the former South Dakota senatorJames Abourezk to combat Arab-bashing.  In a page out of the CIA'sdirty tricks handbook on penetration and destabilization, Bullockjoined the ADC, and then recruited Nazis into the group, apparentlytrying to discredit it, according to published reports.In 1987, the ADL sent Bullock to attend the National Association ofArab Americans annual congress in Washington.  According to courtdocuments, Bullock was told to find the source of the group's funds.Bullock was unable to "follow the money."  But he did such a good jobat ingratiating himself that he was appointed to head a NAAAdelegation that visited Congress member Nancy Pelosi.It's not surprising that the ADL penetrated Arab organizations.  Butonly acute paranoia explains their interest in groups like ACT UP.  Asfar as Bullock was concerned, gay groups in San Francisco were heavilyinfiltrated by what he called "gay left revolutionaries," promptinghim to write about their activities for the ADL.Bullock soon expanded his horizons, moving into the shadowy realm offoreign espionage after Richard Hirschhaut, the head of ADL's SanFrancisco office, introduced him to Thomas Gerard in 1986.  Gerard wasthen a detective with the San Francisco Police Department'sIntelligence Unit.  Gerard had worked as a demolitions expert for theCIA in El Salvador in the early 1980s, where he apparently had morethan a passing interest in right-wing death squads.  (Police searchingGerard's briefcase found extensive CIA literature about torture andinterrogation, photos of blindfolded and chained men, as well aspassports made out to Gerard in 10 different names, including ThomasClouseau.  From a remote jungle island redoubt in the Philippineswhere he fled last November, Gerard told the Los Angeles Times that hewill blow the lid off the CIA's involvement with Latin American deathsquads if he is indicted in the ADL spy case.)After their very first encounter in the ADL office, Gerard and Bullockhad lunch at McDonald's, "I liked Tom right off," Bullock later told aSan Francisco police investigator whose report of the interrogationwas obtained by the _Voice_.  "Tom is a very charming, roguishcharacter, with a great deal of integrity.  Let me say here, Iconsider Tom Gerard one of the finest policemen I've ever workedwith, absolutely.  Honest, capable, intelligent and 100 percentAmerican."Before long, Bullock was providing Gerard with confidential ADLreports on various groups and individuals.  In turn, Gerard gaveBullock classified police intelligence files on local Arab Americans,skinheads, and others.  Bullock told the FBI that Gerard's materialended up in his ADL reports.  "I would say 99 percent of the data thatI got was name, address, and sometimes physical description.  Criminalhistory, very rarely," Bullock told investigators.  Gerard also gaveBullock a chart that outlined a vast network of Bay Area Arab Americanbusinessmen and organizations that allegedly has ties to Middle Eastterror groups, as well as surveillance photos of Arab Americansreceiving weapons training overseas.  Bullock claims that U.S. Customsin New York gave Gerard the photos.  "It was understood that Bullockwould be very careful with what he did with the information Gerardgave him, and that Bullock would not release it except to the ADL orother law enforcement officers," says an FBI report.There was nothing unusual about Bullock's cozy relationship with lawenforcement.  By the mid-1980s, the ADL was swapping files withhundreds of "official friends," the organization's euphemism for U.S.law enforcement and intelligence sources.  The ADL's relationship withthe FBI's counterterrorism office was so close that ADL's reports onArab American group's covert ties to Middle East terrorists were "mustreading."It's no accident that police found a 1986 classified FBI reportentitled "Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)--NewYork Area" while searching the ADL's San Francisco office.  In 1987,ADL spooks investigated seven Palestinians and a Kenyan studying inCalifornia universities on student visas.  When the ADL discoveredthey were disseminating PFLP literature, it informed the FBI, which inturn took the case to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.After the INS ordered the students deported as subversives, ADLregional director David Lehrer gloated in the _Los Angeles Times_about his office's cooperation with law enforcement, although he'sbackpedaling now.  The "Los Angeles 8" deportation is still underappeal.                            *     *     *While the ADL worked quietly with America's top cops, it enjoyedsimilar ties with Israel's spy agencies -- a charge that ADL leadersvehemently deny.  But as early as July 7, 1961, ADL director BenjaminEpstein wrote to B'nai B'rith executive secretary Saul Joftes,requesting $25,000 for his investigators.  "Our information," heboasted to Joftes, "in addition to being essential for our ownoperations, has been of great value and service to both the UnitedStates Department and the Israeli Government.  All data have been madeavailable to both countries with full knowledge to each that we arethe source."In 1987, the ADL came under FBI scrutiny in the wake of the Pollardspy scandal.  While assigned to the Navy's Anti-Terrorist AlertCenter, where he had access to the most closely guarded U.S. secrets,Jonathan Pollard stole thousands of pages of classified documents forIsrael, which, according to federal prosecutors, "could fill a roomthe size of a large closet...ten feet by six feet by six feet."Pollard's handler was Avi Sella, an Israeli air force colonel whosewife worked for the New York ADL as a lawyer.  Pollard later wrote tofriends that a prominent ADL leader was deeply involved in the Israelispy operation.While there is no proof that anyone connected with the ADL wasinvolved with Pollard, there is evidence that the ADL freely passesinformation to Israeli intelligence.  In March 1993, the FBIinterrogated David Gurvitz, an ADL fact finder in Los Angeles until1992 when he was fired by Suall for illegally obtaining policeinformation to use against a rival at the Simon Wiesenthal Center.The FBI pointedly asked Gurvitz if he had ever transmitted informationto Israel.  Gurvitz admitted that in 1992 he had learned from a lawenforcement contact that Michael Elias, allegedly a member of aradical PLO faction, was scheduled to travel from San FranciscoInternational Airport en route to Haifa.  Gurvitz phoned the deputyIsraeli consul general in L.A. with the information.  "Later the sameday," according to a 15-page FBI interview of Gurvitz obtained by the_Voice_, "Gurvitz was called back by another man, who said he was fromthe Israeli Consulate, and who asked Gurvitz to repeat the informationabout Elias.  Gurvitz did not get this man's name, but theirconversation was in Hebrew so Gurvitz felt confident the man wasactually an Israeli Consulate official."Among the 12,000 names of private citizens that police found in ADLfiles in San Francisco was Mohammed Jarad, a 36-year-old Chicagoresident who was arrested in Israel on January 25, for allegedlydistributing hundreds of thousands of dollars to Hamas, the largeIslamic fundamentalist movement in the Occupied Territories.  TheChicago ADL office runs at least three undercover informants who workwith "official friends" in local law enforcement, according todocuments released by the San Francisco D.A. and sources close to theADL.  Given these facts, Arab American groups surmise that the ADL haspassed information on Jarad to Israeli intelligence.One technique used by the ADL to monitor the large Arab Americancommunity in the Midwest was to scan the local Arab press for funeralnotices.  According to sources familiar with the practice, ADLinvestigators in unmarked vans videotaped the Palestinian funerals,which sometimes turned into PLO rallies.  Palestinians have beendetained at Ben-Gurion Airport simply on the basis of having beenfilmed attending a funeral in Chicago, according to Suhail Miari, theexecutive director of the United Holy Land Fund, whose cousin was anArab member of Israel's Knesset.Shortly after Jarad was arrested, the Israeli government announcedthat Hamas was being run from America with money and operationalinstructions relayed by courier or fax.  Israel's charges were playedup on the front page of _The New York Times_.  According to well-placed sources, Yehudit Barsky, an ADL fact finder in New York, workedclosely with Israeli officials on this campaign of vilification,introducing "friendly" reporters to "official friends" in Chicago lawenforcement.Barsky, who is fluent in Arabic, prepared an ADL report about howHamas is funded in America.  She identified the Dallas-based Islamicassociation for Palestine in North America as the front organizationfor Hamas in the U.S.A.  "Its infrastructure functions as aninterlocking network of organizations, small businesses, andindividual activists," says the February 1993 ADL report, whichoutlines the organization's development, its activities on U.S.college campuses, and its "metamorphosis" during the Gulf War. Italso traces Hamas fundraising through a plethora of alleged front-groups from Plainfield, Indiana, to Culver City, California.  It isdoubtful that Barsky could have compiled such sophisticated datawithout the help of "official friends" and ADL spies.Barsky refused to comment.  But she used to talk to Greg Slabodkin asmany as three times a week when he was an opposition researcher forAIPAC, whose spy operation was disclosed last summer in the _Voice_."The level of cooperation was very close," Slabodkin said during arecent phone conservation from Israel where he is in graduate school."If we felt our files were lacking, we contacted the ADL."When Sha'wan Jabarin, a 30-year-old Palestinian human rights worker inthe Occupied Territories won a $25,000 Reebok Human Rights Award in1990, Slabodkin recalls that Barsky faxed AIPAC the man's entirepolice file, which she had obtained from the Israeli embassy.  Jabarinhad been arrested numerous times in Israel, and once confessed tobeing a member of the PLO after having been severely tortured.Jabarin, who received a short jail term, became an AmnestyInternational Prisoner of Conscience.  Of course, to AIPAC and theADL, Jabarin was a terrorist.  Slabodkin, who was ordered to keep tabson him when he was in the U.S. to receive his award, called arepresentative of Al Haq, the Palestinian human rights group thatemployed Jabarin, to obtain his itinerary.  AIPAC even opened a fileon musician Jackson Browne, who presented Jabarin with the Reebokaward.While the ADL may be able to rationalize its close monitoring ofArabs, and even left-wing gay revolutionaries, it has a far hardertime explaining its obsession with spying on anti-apartheid activists.David Gurvitz told the FBI that when he started working as a factfinder for the ADL in L.A. in March 1989, ADL files already bulgedwith information about the Israel-South African connection and anti-apartheid groups.  "Gurvitz confirmed that the ADL did routinelycollect information on persons engaged in anti-apartheid activities inthe United States," says the FBI report.  While Gurvitz said therewere files in the L.A. ADL office dating to the 1930s, he estimatedthe oldest material on anti-apartheid activities dates back to thelate 1970s, paralleling Begin's rise to power in Israel and adeepening of ties between the Jewish state and South Africa. "Inabout August, 1992," says the report of the FBI's March 3, 1993,interview with Gurvitz, "an anti-apartheid demonstration was held atthe South African Consulate in Los Angeles.  Participating in thedemonstration were the Los Angeles Student Coalition and the SocialistWorkers Party.  Gurvitz went to two demonstration planning sessions,and a subsequent demonstration.  He wrote a report for the ADL on eachof the planning sessions and on the demonstration.  Copies of thereports were disseminated to Bullock, among others, in care of the SanFrancisco ADL office."In 1986 Bullock learned that the consul general of the South AfricanConsulate in Los Angeles would be speaking in Las Vegas at a meetingorganized by Willis Carto, the head of the anti-Semitic Liberty Lobby."Suspecting that the Consul General did not know who Willis Carto is,"says the FBI report, "Bullock suggested to Gerard that they might wantto warn the South Africans.  Gerard agreed and informed the ConsulGeneral, who canceled his appearance."A few months later, Gerard phoned Bullock and told him a South Africanintelligence officer wanted to meet them.  During a rendezvous in ahotel near Fisherman's Wharf, the South African said he was interestedin acquiring information on American anti-apartheid activists.  TheSouth African, who called himself Mr. Humphries, also asked forinformation about groups that were advocating divestments.  "Gerard,who was present throughout the meeting," says the FBI report, "toldHumphries that he [Gerard] had been employed by the CIA....Humphriesoffered to pay Bullock $150.00 per month in exchange for information.Bullock noted that much of the information Humphries said he wantedwas already in the possession of Bullock and the ADL."Between 1987 and 1991, Bullock sold information to South Africanintelligence, receiving steady raises, which he split evenly withGerard.  "Bullock said it was his impression, though Gerard neverexplicitly told him so, (and Bullock never asked) that Gerard may havebeen telling the CIA about his and Bullock's contacts with the SouthAfricans," says the FBI report.  "Gerard had said he knew the CIA'resident agent' in San Francisco....Once, after Gerard droppedBullock off at Bullock's residence following a meeting with Louie [whoreplaced Humphries as their handler], Gerard said he was going to goto the San Francisco CIA office."Al the while, Gerard may have been "tasking" Bullock for the CIA."Bullock recalled that once, after he had met Gerard, Bullock went toChicago, Illinois to conduct an investigation on behalf of the ADL,"says the FBI report.  "The target of the investigation was a groupcalled the Palestine Human Rights Campaign.  Bullock learned that awoman [name deleted] was transporting money between the PLO or thePFLP, and the United States.  Bullock told this to Gerard.  Gerardlater told Bullock that Gerard's 'guy at the CIA' would like to knowmore.  Gerard asked Bullock if Bullock would go back to Chicago togather more information on the Palestine Human Rights Campaign.Bullock, however, never did go back."Gerard also seems to have had a close relationship with Mossad, whichmay have started in 1991 when he went on an ADL junket to Israel.  TheADL frequently sponsors trips for American law enforcement officialsto Israel, where they are wined and dined and meet their counterpartsin various intelligence agencies.  According to an affidavit by SanFrancisco police inspector Roth, the "all-expense paid trip [toIsrael] was more or less a thank-you gift and a liaison gesture by theADL to continue the close relationships it has with specific lawenforcement officers from the United States."Gerard may have liked what he saw in Israel.  A short time aftertravelling there, he went to Addis Ababa where he helped with Mossad'srescue of Ethiopian Jews.As Gerard's relationship with South Africa deepened, he talked moreopenly about his exploits in the CIA.  "Bullock recalled Gerardmentioning that he had been in Algeria on CIA business, and thatGerard discussed the PLO and 'safehouses,'" says the FBI report, "Tothis Louie once responded that Israeli intelligence had determinedthat the PLO and the African National Congress were cooperating.Gerard also spoke of having travelled with the CIA to Afghanistan....Louie also [told Gerard and Bullock] about his adventures inside SouthAfrica as an intelligence officer.  Both Gerard and Louie traded 'warstories' and regaled each other and Bullock with tales of 'narrowscrapes.'"Although there is still much mystery about what triggered lawenforcement's investigation of the ADL, it was probably the theft ofa classified FBI report on the Nation of Islam from the FBI's SanFrancisco office.  Police armed with search warrants recovered thereport in the ADL San Francisco office.  Gurvitz says he had sent acopy of it to Mira Boland, the director of the ADL's fact findingdivision in Washington, D.C.  Boland was preparing an op-ed piece for_The Washington Times_, in which she argued that the Nation of Islamshould not receive federal funds for the reconstruction of L.A.because the group is anti-Semitic and violence-prone.  (Boland, whohad arranged the ADL police junket to Israel attended by Gerard,testified in a 1990 criminal trial in Roanoke, Virginia, that she hadworked for the CIA for 14 months and later was a subcontractor for theDefense Department before joining the ADL.  During the trial, Bolandadmitted to sharing information with a CIA official at an invitation-only ADL conference.)After he was questioned by the FBI last fall, Gerard fled to thePhilippines, which has no extradition treaty with America.  Gerard isbelieved to have supplied information from police computers not onlyto the ADL, but to Israel and South Africa as well.  The _SanFrancisco Examiner_ reported that Gerard may be charged with violatingfederal espionage laws.Although Bullock worked for the ADL for 30 years, and Irwin Suallpraised him in a July 1992 memo as "our number one investigator," theADL now argues that he was a rogue agent.  In its own defense, the ADLalso asserts that its fact finders operate no differently thanjournalists.  After all, ask ADL officials, don't journalists keepfiles?But the difference between the practice of journalism and the ADL'smethod of gathering information couldn't be more striking.Journalists place information in the public domain where they are heldaccountable for falsehoods, distortions, and libel.  And for the mostpart, journalists don't share their investigative files with foreignand domestic police agencies.  The ADL has no such inhibition.Because many of its files are not open to public scrutiny, falseinformation collected by ideologically biased researchers cannot becorrected.  Once a proud human rights group, the ADL has become theJewish thought police."The ADL says it's a human rights group not just for Jews but foreveryone," says Chip Berlet, a highly respected researcher at theMassachusetts-based Political Research Associates, which monitorsright-wing extremist groups.  "That's fine but it can't do that andspy on Palestinians.  It's blatantly unethical and frankly immoral.""My argument to people is that the ADL wears four hats.  Each of thehats independently is appropriate.  It is a broad-based human rightsgroup that looks at the broad issues of prejudice and discrimination.It is a group that defends Jews against defamation.  Entirely noble.Nothing wrong with that hat.  It is a group, whose leaders, at least,consistently defend the actions of Israel against its critics, whichagain is entirely appropriate.  And it is a group that maintains aninformation-sharing arrangement with law enforcement.  Again, there isnothing wrong for a group to do that.""But you can't do all four.  It is impossible to do all four and notviolate the bounds of ethics.  There's a built-in conflict of interestif you wear all four hats."ADL national director Abraham Foxman apparently sees no such conflict.In a September 1, 1992, letter to the _Voice_, Foxman complained: "ADLhas a proud 80-year record of fighting bigotry and promoting civilrights and constitutional freedoms.  Any imputation of an effort ormotive on our part to smear or stifle the free speech of anyone isfalse and baseless""Throughout his pieces [on AIPAC's spying], Friedman describes thedissemination of information as if it were slander, and the existenceof files as a token of McCarthyite inclination.  The depiction ismisleading in several ways.  Virtually every journalist, academic,politician and organization keeps files on subjects they deemrelevant; tracing the logic of Friedman's reckless charges, theLibrary of Congress is tantamount to the KGB.  Moreover, disseminatingthe public record of a public figure is neither defamation norMcCarthyism."But many believe the ADL is increasingly in the defamation business.Ask Jesse Jackson, James Abourezk, or the leaders of the New JewishAgenda -- all past targets of ADL smears.  (At the same time, the ADLexonerated the fascist World Anti-Communist League, which assistedRonald Reagan's covert war against Nicaragua, a policy endorsed by ADLleaders.)In the early 1980s, researchers Russ Bellant and Berlet asked to meetfact finding head Irwin Suall, to discuss their work on anti-SemiteLyndon LaRouche.  "Our view then of Irwin Suall was that he was thisreally terrific investigator," says Berlet.  "So we introduceourselves, say what we are up to and Suall leans back in his chair andbasically runs down a dossier on each of us: about what our politicalactivities are, who we work with, what organizations we belong to.Obviously, he was just trying to blow us away and he succeedsadmirably.  We were just sitting there with our mouths open feelingvery uncomfortable.""And then he leans forward and says, 'The right-wing isn't theproblem.  The left-wing is the problem.  The Soviet Union is thebiggest problem in the world for Jews.  It's the American left that isthe biggest threat to American Jews.  You're on the wrong track.You're part of the problem.'  We were stunned.  I was virtually intears.  This is not how I perceived myself.  We basically stumbled outof there in a daze."----------------------------------------------------------------------               Letters (response to Friedman's article)         The Village Voice, May 18, 1993, Vol. XXXVIII No. 20A LEAGUE OF HIS OWNRobert I. Friedman's assault on the Anti-Defamation League [The Anti-Defamation League Is Spying On You." May 11] demonstrates that he hasan axe to grind and his own prejudiced and biased agenda to promote.It also demonstrates that concern for accurate reporting is far downon his list.  The story is replete with inaccuracies, innuendos, andoutright falsehoods, and conveys a picture of ADL so divorced fromreality as to be farcical.  Friedman is even wrong on such basic,easily determined facts as where ADL was founded (Chicago, not NewYork) and the building in which ADL'S San Francisco office is located(not the Jewish Community Federation building pictured).ADL has done the work of fighting haters for 80 years, without"spying" on organizations or individuals and with profound respect forthe law.  Our mission is to monitor and expose those who are anti-Jewish, racist, anti-democratic, and violence-prone, and we monitorthem primarily by reading publications and attending public meetings.Through the years, we have published scores of reports on anti-Semitism emanating from both the left and the right.  In fact,although Friedman's bias leads him to assume the contrary, ADL'sprimary concern is still the far right.Because extremist organizations are highly secretive, sometimes ADLcan learn of their activities only by using undercover sources.Friedman's hyperbole notwithstanding, these sources function in amanner directly analogous to investigative journalists.  Some haveperformed great service to the American people -- for example, byuncovering the existence of right-wing extremist paramilitary trainingcamps -- with no recognition and at considerable personal risk.  Theinformation ADL obtains is placed in the public domain, and throughthe years ADL has established a reputation for accurate reporting.Friedman's article, by contrast, contains so much misinformation thatit would take an article equally as long to set the record straight.A few examples:  He states that an "ADL leader was deeply involved inthe [Jonathan Pollard] Israeli spy operation," and that Pollard'shandler's wife "worked for the New York ADL as a lawyer."  Not true.Friedman also states:  "ADL investigators in unmarked vans videotapedPalestinian funerals."  Not true.  Elsewhere, he asserts that ADL wasobsessed "with spying on anti-apartheid activists."  Again, not true.We could go on and on -- and, of course, Friedman does not reveal*his* sources.The distortion games Friedman plays when he mentions numbers furtherreveal his lack of objectivity.  When it comes to how much ADL paidRoy Bullock a week -- as an independent contractor, not an employee(an important distinction Friedman also fails to make) -- he includesthe zeros ($75.00, $150.00), inviting the reader to see a largenumber.  By contrast, when he observes that ADL paid Bullock "nearly$170,000" between 1985 and 1993, he chooses not to point out thatamounts to little more than $20,000 a year -- hardly an excessive sum.What is accurate about Friedman's story is Chip Berlet's descriptionof ADL's four hats.  Yes, ADL looks at broad issues of prejudice anddiscrimination.  Yes, ADL defends Israel against critics.  And yes,ADL maintains an information-sharing relationship with law enforcementregarding extremist activities and hate crimes.  We see no conflict inthese four activities, and we believe most _Voice_ readers won'teither.ABRAHAM FOXMANNational DirectorAnti-Defamation LeagueManhattan----------------------------------------------------------------------ROBERT I. FRIEDMAN REPLIES:For the ADL to compare itself to investigative journalists is absurd.Journalists don't spy on Arabs and anti-apartheid activists and thenfreely pass their files to South African and Israeli intelligence.But according to police the confessions of two paid ADL investigators,buttressed by 700 pages of court documents and interviews, the ADLdoes.  Indeed, the ADL spies on groups that are neither anti-Semiticnor violent.  Police confiscated ADL files on hundreds of mainstreamgroups ranging from ACT UP to Peace Now.  Respected intellectuals andMiddle East scholars who disagree with the ADL's political views haveended up on ADL blacklists, their reputations smeared.  "Privateorganizations have no business paying operatives inside policedepartments or having spies," says an April 17 editorial in the _St.Louis Post-Dispatch_, condemning ADL spying.  On April 10, policearmed with search warrants raided ADL offices in San Francisco andL.A. after concluding that "ADL employees were apparently less thantruthful" in voluntarily turning over documents during an earliersearch, according to San Francisco police inspector Ron Roth's swornaffidavit.  Roth also asserts that Bullock was a "paid employee forthe ADL."  If so, by failing to pay taxes on $170,000 of income paidto Bullock, the ADL could face a total of 48 felony counts, accordingto court papers.  The ADL may also face felony charges for illegallyobtaining confidential information from police computers.  As forerrors:  The ADL was founded in Chicago, and moved to New York in1947.  But it was an original tenant in the San Francisco buildingshown in the _Voice_ photo, moving out a few months ago.  I neverwrote that an "ADL leader was deeply involved in the [Pollard]Israeli spy operation."  I reported that Pollard himself made thecharge.  And in court papers, Pollard's own lawyer said that the wifeof Pollard's handler worked for the ADL.  If I have a bias, it is onthe side of the First and Fourth Amendments.

On the 10th I had got my crew, done the paper-work, and left for the Zhdanov District. That's in Azerbaijan, near theNagorno Karabagh region.After the 14th, rumors started to the effect that in Karabagh, specificallyin Stepanakert, an uprising had taken place. They said "uprising" inAzerbaijani, but I don't think it was really an uprising, just a demonstration. After that the unrest started. Several Armenians living in the Zhdanov District were injured. How were they injured? They were beaten, even women; it was said that they were at the demonstrations, but they live here, and went from here to Karabagh to demonstrate. After that I felt uneasy. Therewere some conversations about Armenians among the local population: theArmenians had done this, the Armenians had done that. Right there at the site.I was attacked a couple of times by kids. Well true, the guys from my crew wouldn't let them come at me with cables and knives. After that I felt really bad. I didn't know where to go. I up and called home. And my children tell me,"There's unrest everywhere, be careful." Well I had a project going on. I toldthe Second Secretary of the District Party Committee what had been going on and said I wanted to take my crew off the site. They wouldn't allow it, they said, "Nothing's going to happen to you, we've entrusted the matter to the police, we've warned everyone in the district, nothing will happen to you." Well, in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me, he knows all the local people and would protect me if something happened. Thisman didn't leave me alone for five minutes: he was at work the whole time and afterward he spent the night with us, too.I sense some disquiet and call home; my wife also tells me, "The situation isvery tense, be careful."We finished the job at the site, and I left for Sumgait first thing on themorning of the 29th. When we left the guys warned me, they told me that Ishouldn't tell anyone on the way that I was an Armenian. I took someone else'sbusiness travel documents, in the name of Zardali, and hid my own. I hid it and my passport in my socks. We set out for Baku. Our guys were on the bus, they sat behind, and I sat up front. In Baku they had come to me and said thatthey had to collect all of our travel documents just in case. As it turns out they knew what was happening in Sumgait.I arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait isclosed, there is no way to get there. That the city is closed off and the buses aren't running. Buses normally leave Baku for Sumgait almost every twominutes. And suddenly--no buses. Well, we tried to get there via privatedrivers. One man, an Azerbaijani, said, "Let's go find some other way to getthere." They found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver totake us to Sumgait.He took us there. But the others had said, "I wouldn't go if you gave me athousand rubles." "Why?" "Because they're burning the city and killing theArmenians. There isn't an Armenian left." Well I got hold of myself so I couldstill stand up. So we squared it away, the four of us got in the car, and we set off for Sumgait. On the way the driver says, "In fact there aren't anyArmenians left. 'They burned them all, beat them all, and stabbed them." Well I was silent. The whole way--20-odd miles--I was silent. The driver asks me, "How old are you, old man?" He wants to know: if I'm being that quiet, not saying anything, maybe it means I'm an Armenian. "How old are you?" he asks me. I say, "I'm 47." "I'm 47 too, but I call you 'old man'." I say, "It depends on God, each person's life in this world is different." I look mucholder than my years, that's why he called me old man. Well after that he wassilent, too.We're approaching the city, I look and see tanks all around, and a cordon.Before we get to the Kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand. Well, hewas waving his hand, we all start waving our hands. I'm sitting there withthem, I start waving my hand, too. I realized that this was a sign that meantthere were no Armenians with us.I look at the city--there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the street, you know, and there's no traffic. Well probably I was scared. Theystopped our car. People were standing on the sidewalks. They have armature shafts, and stones . . . And they stopped us . . .Along the way the driver tells us how they know who's an Armenian and who's not. The Armenians usually . . . For example, I'm an Armenian, but I speak their language very well. Well Armenians usually pronounce the Azeri word for "nut," or "little nut," as "pundukh," but "fundukh" is actually correct. The pronunciations are different. Anyone who says "pundukh," even if they're not Armenian, they immediately take out and start to slash. Another one says, "There was a car there, with five people inside it," he says. "They started hitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire. And they didn't let thepeople out," he says, "they wouldn't let them get out of the car." I only saw the car, but the driver says that he saw everything. Well he often drives fromBaku to Sumgait and back . . .When they stop us we all get out of the car. I look and there's a short guy,his eyes are gleaming, he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone inthe other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one. "We'reAzerbaijani,' they tell him, 'no Armenians here." He did come up to me when we were pulling our things out and says, "Maybe you're an Armenian, old man?" But in Azerbaijani I say, "You should be ashamed of yourself!" And . . . he left. Turned and left. That was all that happened. What was I to do? I had to . . . the city was on fire, but I had to steal my children out of my own home.They stopped us at the entrance to Mir Street, that's where the Kavkaz store and three large, 12-story buildings are. That's the beginning of down-town. I saw that burned automobile there, completely burned, only metal remained. I couldn't figure out if it was a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhets. Later I was told it was a Zhiguli. And the people in there were completely incinerated. Nothing remained of them, not even any traces. That driver had told me about it, and Isaw the car myself. The car was there. The skeleton, a metallic carcass. About30 to 40 yards from the Kavkaz store.I see a military transport, an armored personnel carrier. The hatches areclosed. And people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it, thecrowd is. And I hear shots, not automatic fire, it's true, but pistol shots.Several shots. There were Azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier. Someone in the crowd was shooting. Apparently they either wanted to kill the soldiers or get a machine gun or something. At that point there was only one armored personnel carrier. And all the tanks were outside the city, cordoning off Sumgait.I walked on. I see two Azerbaijanis going home from the plant. I can tell by their gait that they're not bandits, they're just people, walking home. Ijoined them so in case something happened, in case someone came up to usand asked questions, either of us would be in a position to answer, you see.But I avoided the large groups because I'm a local and might be quickly recognized. I tried to keep at a distance, and walked where there were fewerpeople. Well so I walked into Microdistrict 2, which is across from our block.I can't get into our block, but I walked where there were fewer people, so as to get around. Well there I see a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking behind him. And he's shouting into a megaphone: "Comrades, the Armenian-Azerbaijani war has begun!"The police have megaphones like that. So they're talking and walking around the second microdistrict. I see that they're coming my way, and turn off behind a building. I noticed that they walked around the outside buildings, and inside the microdistricts there were about 5 or 6 people standing on everycorner, and at the middles of the buildings, and at the edges. What they were doing I can't say, because I couldn't get up close to them, I was afraid. But the most important thing was to get away from there, to get home, and at leastfind out if my children were alive or not . . .

 15        I don't mean to sound disrespectful, but since the majorityof the contributors (and may be even readers) of this newsgroup seemto be muslims, christians and jews, my question could be of some interest to any of them.        It's my impression that both Islam and Christianity pay greatrespect to an obscure 1st century jewish lad from Judea/Galilee. Why they chose this particular jew among all possible jews is a mysteryto me (personally, I prefer Woody Allen - his stories are much juicier)- but perhaps it's an accident of history.        Anyway, it seems that they may be talking about two differentjews. According to the New Testament his father's name was Joseph,while in Qur'an he appears as Zachariah.          Who's right and why the name difference? I'm really curious.                David.

If this is Judaism,I think Judaism should be combatted as any extremist and dangerousphilosophy.I suspect however that Martin Buber, Albert Einstein and other Jewishscholars would have rather converted to Christianity than stay Jews, ifthey would have perceived Judaism as such a perverted philosophy.Those who wish to learn something about the perversion of Judaism,should consult the masterly work by Yehoshua Harkabi, who was manyyears the head of Israeli Intelligence and an opponent of the PLO.

 10604/19/1993 0000  Lezghis AstirBy NEJLA SAMMAKIA Associated Press Writer   GUSSAR, Azerbaijan (AP) -- The 600,000 Lezghis of Azerbaijan and Russia havebegun clamoring for their own state, threatening turmoil in a tranquil corner of the Caucasus.The region has escaped the ethnic warfare of neighboring Nagorno-Karabakh,Abkhazia and Ossetia, but Lezhgis could become the next minority in the formerSoviet Union to fight for independence.Lezghis, who are Muslim descendents of nomadic shepherds, are angry about theconscription of their young men to fight in Azerbaijan's 5-year-old undeclaredwar with Armenia.They also want to unite the Lezghi regions of Azerbaijan and Russia, whichwere effectively one until the breakup of the Soviet Union created nationalborders that had been only lines on a map.A rally of more than 3,000 Lezghis in March to protest conscription anddemand a separate "Lezghistan" alarmed the Azerbaijani government.Officials in Baku, the capital, deny rumors that police shot sixdemonstrators to death. But the government announced strict security measuresand began cooperating with Russian authorities to control the movement ofLezhgis living across the border in the Dagestan region of Russia.Visitors to Gussar, the center of Lezhgi life, found the town quiet soonafter the protest. Children played outdoors in the crisp mountain air.At the Sunday bazaar, men in heavy coats and dark fur hats gathered todiscuss grievances ranging from high customs duties at the Russian border to awar they say is not theirs."I have been drafted, but I won't go," said Shamil Kadimov, gold teethglinting in the sun. "Why must I fight a war for the Azerbaijanis? I havenothing to do with Armenia."More than 3,000 people have died in the war, which centers on the disputedterritory of Nagorno-Karabakh, about 150 miles to the southeast.Malik Kerimov, an official in the mayor's office, said only 11 of 300 localsdrafted in 1992 had served."The police don't force people to go," he said. "They are afraid of anuprising that could be backed by Lezghis in Dagestan."All the men agreed that police had not fired at the demonstrators, butdisagreed on how the protest came about.Some said it occurred spontaneously when rumors spread that Azerbaijan wasabout to draft 1,500 men from the Gussar region, where 75,000 Lezghis live.Others said the rally was ordered by Gen. Muhieddin Kahramanov, leader of theLezhgi underground separatist movement, Sadval, based in Dagestan."We organized the demonstration when families came to us distraught aboutdraft orders," said Kerim Babayev, a mathematics teacher who belongs to Sadval."We hope to reunite peacefully, by approaching everyone -- the Azerbaijanis, the Russians."In the early 18th century, the Lezhgis formed two khanates, or sovereignties,in what are now Azerbaijan and Dagestan. They roamed freely with their sheepover the green hills and mountains between the two khanates.By 1812, the Lezghi areas were joined to czarist Russia. After 1917, theycame under Soviet rule. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the 600,000 Lezghis were faced for the first time with strict borders.About half remained in Dagestan and half in newly independent Azerbaijan."We have to pay customs on all this, on cars, on wine," complained MaisTalibov, a small trader. His goods, laid out on the ground at the bazaar,included brandy, stomach medication and plastic shoes from Dagestan."We want our own country," he said. "We want to be able to move about easily.But Baku won't listen to us."Physically, it is hard for outsiders to distinguish Lezhgis from otherAzerbaijanis. In many villages, they live side by side, working at the same jobs and intermarrying to some degree.But the Lezhgis have a distinctive language, a mixture of Arabic, Turkish andPersian with strong guttural vowels.Azerbaijan officially supports the cultural preservation of its 10 largestethnic minorities. The Lezghis have weekly newspapers and some elementary school classes in their language.Autonomy is a different question. If the Lezghis succeeded in separating fromAzerbaijan, they would set a precedent for other minorities, such as the Talish in the south, the Tats in the nearby mountains and the Avars of easternAzerbaijan.-- David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | "How do we explain Turkish troops onS.D.P.A.

(Tovfik Kasimov - Azeri Leader - September 25, 1992)                  "Today's ethnic cleansing policies by the Serbian dictatorship against  Croatians and Muslims of Yugoslavia, as well as the Soviet Republic  of Armenia's against the Muslim population of neighboring Azerbaijan,  are really no different in their aspirations than the genocide   perpetrated by the Armenian Government 78 years ago against the  Turkish and Kurdish Muslims and Sephardic Jews living in these  lands."

This is not a fresh case ofI don't have the faintest idea what literature it is to which you refer. Is this an explicit statement by some document? Or is it your interpretation of statements in such literature? Or is this a figment of your imagination or a Nazi Armenian propaganda movie script? In any case, a fascinating piece of analysis. Here are the facts:Source: Walker, Christopher: "Armenia: The Survival of a Nation."        New York (St. Martin's Press), 1980.This generally pro-Armenian work contains the following informationof direct relevance to the Nazi Holocaust: a) Dro (the butcher), the former dictator of x-Soviet Armenia and the architect of the genocide of 2.5 million Muslims, the most respected of Nazi Armenian leaders, established an Armenian Provisional Republic in Berlin during World War II; b) this 'provisional government' fully endorsed and espoused the social theories of the Nazis, declared themselves and all Armenians to be members of the Aryan 'Super-Race;' c) they published an Anti-Semitic, racist journal, thereby aligning themselves with the Nazis and their efforts to exterminate the Jews; and, d) they mobilized an Armenian Army of up to 30,000 members which fought side by side with the Wehrmacht. In fact, by 1942, Nazi Armenians in Europe had established a vast network of pro-German collaborators, that extended over two continents. Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and Waffen-SS in Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in espionage and fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and Arabian Peninsula. They were promised an 'independent' state under German 'protection' in an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National Council.' (A copy of this agreement can be found in the 'Congressional Record,' November 1, 1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic, Nazi Armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often expressed pro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war.In 1941, while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Naziconcentration camps, the Nazi Armenians in Germany formed the firstArmenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had grown into eight battalions of 30,000-strong under the command of Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of x-Soviet Armenia and the architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of extermination of the Jews.This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an "encore"performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed andexterminated 2.5 million Muslims by colluding with the invading Russian army.Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

 68Distribution: worldMessage-ID: <1qlaf7$s31@genesis.MCS.COM>NNTP-Posting-Host: localhost.mcs.com                       Yigal et al, sue ADL   Nineteen people, including the son off ormer Israeli Defence Minister Moshe  Arens, sued the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) on Wednesday, accusing the  Jewish group of disclosing confidential official information about them.      Richard Hirschhaut, director of the San Francisco branch of the ADL, art dealer Roy Bullock and former policeman Tom Gerard were also named as defendants in the suit, filed in San Francisco County Superior Court.      The 19 accuse the ADL of B'nai B'rith, a group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, and the other defendants of secretly gathering information on them, including data from state and federal agencies.      The suit alleges they disclosed the information to others, including the governments of Israel and South Africa, in what it alleges was a ``a massive spying operation.''      The action is a class-action suit. It was filed on behalf of about 12,000 anti-apartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom the plaintiffs believe the ADL, Bullock and Gerard gathered information.      Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately  available for comment on Wednesday.      The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that Gerard, a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit, passed confidential police files on California political activists to a spy ring.      The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL, Bullock and Gerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL's offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles.      The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California, which prohibits the publication of information obtained from official  sources.  It seeks exemplary damages of at least $2,500 per person as well as  other unspecified damages.      Lawyer Pete McCloskey, a former Congresmen who is representing the plaintiffs, said the 19 plaintiffs included Arab-Americans and Jews -- and  his wife Helen, who also had information gathered about her.      One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens, a research scientist at the University of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli Defence Minister.      Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept on him in the 1980s, presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of Palestinians and his position on the Israeli-occupied territories.      According to court documents released last week, Bullock and Gerard both kept information on thousands of California political activists.      In the documents, a police investigator said he believed the ADL paid Bullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and Bullock received confidential information from the authorities.      No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case. The ADL, Bullock and Gerard have all denied any wrongdoing.  ...........  js

These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British   soldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in   favor of a compromise with the Palestinians.The Irgun killed SOLDIERS,  which is a legitimate way to drive an unwantedfogriend regime from a country.  They didn't kill blindly their families orsuch (not as a policy,  I agree that brits which were not soldiers also werekilled sometimes) nor they killed Arabs just for being Arabs.In case I have to remind you the difference,  the majority of the attacks ofthe Arab terrorist organizations was on civilians.  They even tried tojustify their attacks by saying that all Jews in the Israel served in the armyat one point in time or another and therefore are legitimate targets.   In addition, they   massacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributing   to the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their   very lives.Yes, these exceptions were tragic mistakes.  I wasn't there and don't havereffereces handy but from what I heard your description is a bit carried away,most of the vilagers fled with several dozens,  most of them claimed to befighters being killed.Those "massaceres" are far from being the rule considering that dozens if nothounders of Arab vilages came under Israeli rule during the same time period.   I mention this not because I'm anti semitic [I'm part   Jewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the   Israelites pisses me off so.  I'm not as critical of the   Palestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the   Jews.  It 's a damn shame that the Palestinians had to pay for   German and European anti semitism.What do you mean "screwed over by the Jews"?  They began the '47 war anddidn't accept the arrgenment planned by the U.N.,  what did you expect theJews to do??

 187REFLECTIONS ON BOSNIALORD OWEN AND THE SERBSIn early February '93, Lord Owen made appearances in New York Cityon the Donahue and Charlie Rose shows. On a couple of occasions onthose shows Lord Owen gave away his pro-Serbian position when hemade the point that much or most of the Bosnian territory then indispute or already overrun by Serbian forces had been controlledand occupied by Serbs before WWII.  It was as if he were sayingthat since the Serbs had previously occupied those territories andlost them during the Hitler years, they should be allowed toreconquer them today.I was familiar with this view because my father, a Yugoslav Jewwho escaped to this country during the war, was aided and foundsympathy among the Serbs during those harrowing years.  In recentmonths when the subject of Serbian aggression was mentioned, myfather would make the point that 850,000 Serbs were killed by Naziand pro-Nazi Croatian forces known as the Ustasha.  My father isso pro-Serbian that he dismissed reports of Serbian atrocities. Myfather also excoriated New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis,because, my father said, Anthony Lewis "is always talking aboutthe Muslims."Update--April 28, 1993 After an uneasy truce in and aroundSbernica, shelling has resumed in nearby areas by all sides andthe killing and the misery continues apace while the Clintonadministration dithers its response.  In the days leading to thecollapse of resistance at Sbernica, Lord Owen changed his tune.Previously he had opposed military intervention on the groundsthat it would endanger U.N. relief workers. When Serbian forcesbegan to march on Sbernica, the threat to U.N. relief soldierswent unmentioned while Lord Owen called for outside interventionto stop Serbian aggression, including the use of air strikes.  Thecurrent disastrous situation can be seen as a failure of the Westand a failure of the Vance-Owen initiative which did nothing tohalt the Serbs. Now that it's too late to save Muslim areas thatLord Owen felt should be in a Muslim state, Lord Owen belatedlycalls for strong action.CLINTON AND BOSNIAIn the summer of 1992, George Kenney, a senior State Departmentofficial, the undersecretary in charge of the Yugoslav desk, madenews when he resigned from the State Department because of theBush administration's refusal to take any action to halt Serbianaggression.  As Kenney saw it, Bush's inaction was largely due tothe president's unwillingness to risk any political capital bygetting involved there.Apparently the same is true of the Clinton administration.Clinton gives the impression that he cares more than Bush didabout the terrible ongoing tragedy, but the practical effect hasso far been the same.According to the New York Times, (4/16/93) the Clintonadministration did everything it could to suppress a mid-Marchreport by its own experts which called for military action ifnecessary to protect "safe havens" for the Muslims. At one point,Senate majority leader, George Mitchell was so incensed that thereport was kept from Congress, that he called for aninvestigation.Instead of helping the desperate Bosnians, Clinton has signalledagain and again that Milosevic and the Serbs are free to do whatthey want in Bosnia--indeed, Clinton and the West have beensignalling that the Serbs should get on with the job and finishoff the Bosnians as quickly as possible while we turn the otherway.  A key signal was when Clinton made it clear that he wouldNOT send in American military forces on the ground.  On thisissue, Clinton has made me wistful for Bush.  Bush and Baker couldnot have done worse, and might have been pressured to do betterwell before this time.  Lives in Bosnia might have been saved andthe destruction might have been curtailed..The Nation, the left and "the Bosnian QUANDARY"Typical of the left's inability to come to grips with the coreissue involved in Bosnia, i.e., a clear aggressor destroyinghundreds of thousands of lives, is the editorial on the "Bosnianquandary" in The Nation (4/26/93).  In the end the editorial votesto do nothing, even while noticing "the ghastly atrocities of theBosnian Serbs"  and that the "greater and lesser powers...ditherand fuss [and] hang back." ("Before anything else happens, theClinton Administration ought to pay the $530 million the UnitedStates owes the" U.N. the editorial concludes.)In its most striking passage, the editorial writer warns that"those who are pushing President Clinton to intervene on the sideof the Bosnians had better review U.S. foreign policy since WorldWar II."  The editorial argues for inaction on the basis that theBosnian Serbs are no worse than any number of U.S. clientsincluding the Chileans, the South Africans, the Greek fascists andothers. (In a subsequent column for The Nation, ChristopherHitchens correctly called this editorial, "contemptible.")***William Pfaff, a European based journalist who writes for the TheNew Yorker and the Los Angeles Times, is among a group of liberalcolumnists like Anthony Lewis, and Leslie Gelb who have clearlyand consistently called for strong Western and Americanintervention to stop the Serbs.  Pfaff's most recent column(Liberal Opinion Week 4/19/93) is entitled "InternationalCowardice Worsened Bosnian Tragedy."He clarifies the international failure which has led to presentsituation in one sentence. "Having refused to intervene tosanction the threat to minority rights in newly independentCroatia in June 1991, or to block or penalize the militaryaggression by Serbia that immediately followed, and the atrocious"ethnic cleansing" which followed that, the United Nations nowcontemplates deploying in Bosnia military force on a scale whichtwo years ago could have deterred the horrors Yugoslavia has sinceexperienced."  He goes on to explain that U.N. plans now envisagedcall for a "more daunting and open-ended military assignment thana direct military intervention to halt the aggression would havebeen a year ago."Aryeh Neier on the Serbs In his "Watching Rights" column in theThe Nation (5/3/93) Aryeh Neier gets to the heart of themotivation of the "aggressors"--the preferred term for the Serbianforces who have been besieging and shelling Sarajevo for more thana year.  He explains that "there is no  military purpose that isserved by the destruction of its fabric and its people...Aboveall, few of those aligned with the forces attacking Sarajevo wouldwant to live there even if the city could be rebuilt.  They arenot city people."It is this, I believe--aside from a desire to break the morale ofBosnians and make them press their government to accept peace atany price--that explains the conduct of the siege ofSarajevo...[I]t is a loathing for all that is urban, pluralist andcosmopolitan that has made Sarajevo the object for devastation."Historically, most of the Serbian population in Bosnia andHerzegovina has been rural, while Muslims, who were the civilservants and intelligentsia during the centuries of Ottoman rule,made up a disproportionate share of the urban population....Thedestruction of Sarajevo is not only an expression of hostilityagainst this city; it is also an attack on the urban idea....Thedemagogues who whipped up the passions let loose by this warexploited not only ethnic and religious bigotry but also hatredfor all that is cosmopolitan."The light that Neier sheds on the issue helps to clarify what isat stake.  The Serbs represent the know-nothing, anti-secularist,fundamentalist, fascist forces who are attacking the urban,cosmopolitan, secular, multi-cultural idea.  They are attackingthe rest of us, just as Hitler did. One irony is that at thebeginning of the crisis over Bosnia, it was for awhile maintainedby the Serbs and their supporters that they were responding to athreat by the Bosnian Muslims to create a fundamentalist state.Neier has shown that it is the Serbs who are  the great threat tosecularism, multi-culturalism, diversity and democracy.  It's theSerbs who are attacking the democratic notion, the democraticidea.Anthony Lewis comes close to the point when he asks why doesrespect for Clinton's presidency "depend...on his actingeffectively against Serbian aggression?...First of all because todo nothing about genocide would be such a betrayal of the valueswe and our allies profess."  (Times, 4/26/93) But it's not merelya betrayal of our values.  It's because the Serbs are attacking usby proxy, just as Hitler was.One argument for decisive action by the West that is heard in adifferent form, is that war in the Balkans is destablizing forEurope.  We hear it as, the Bosnians are Europe's Palestinians;that is to say, just as the Palestinian refugee problem has beenthe key to instability in the Middle East, just so will thehundreds of thousands of Yugoslav refugees of all ethnicitiesresult in turmoil in Europe for decades to come.One of the lessons of the twentieth century is that even thoughthe Atlantic Ocean divides us, the Americas are ultimately tied tothe destiny of Europe. If Europe is destabilized, the U.S. willinevitably be affected and drawn into its problems.  As in awhirlpool,  sooner or later we will be drawn into the maelstrom.And as past history and Pfaff have shown, it's much better if wedo so decisively, quickly and on our terms.Sincerely, Ronald Bleier

The x-Soviet >MY GOSH!!! Sedar, WHAT ARMENIAN GOVERNMENT???  Armenia didn't even become  No wonder you clown are in such a mess. Let's take Sarkis Atamian's (an Armenian Dashnak sociolog) book, "The Armenian Community", pages 97 and 105. Atamian quotes: "... the immediate question concerned itself with the organization and tactics of revolution. The liberation of Armenia, the immediate aim of the Party, was to be attained by:      1. Oral and written propaganda.      2. Terrorism - both as punishment against the enemy and as a measure         of self defense.       3. The creation of an avant-garde of revolutionary groups to be         equipped and prepared for action when other nations were prepared         for a general uprising.      4. The organization of larger committees to be in constant contact with         each other and subject to a central body.      5. Organization of units of guerilla fighters."Now, on page 105, Atamian's book quotes of Armenian constitution: "... If the means was revolution, how was the revolution to be attained? By:      1. Propaganda       2. Preparation of combat units and their indoctrination      3. Encouragement of the revolutionary morale of the people      4. The arming of the people      5. Organization of revolutionary committees      6. Espionage throughout the country and the exchange of information with         the official bodies and journals      7. Organization of financial zones for public collection       8. 'Fighting and using' the weapon of the terror on corrupt government         officers, spies, traitors, grafters, and all sorts of oppressors      9. Defense of the people against attacks from the brigandry     10. Building of roads for the transport of arms     11. Wrecking and looting of governmental institutions."Many of the recent Armenian terrorist acts against the Turkish people were committed by the brainwashed members of the "Tzeghagron", namely, "race-worshipers" of the Dashnag Youth Organization. Ironically, again, Tzeghagron was set up by an undisputed Armenian Nazi, Karekin Nejdeh,in 1941 (see Atamian, loc cit, page 389).Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

A very small part  of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to. Including women and children, such persons discovered so far do not exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in Erzurum. All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled, everything that the people had has been taken away from them, and we found them in a destitute situation.

The conditions werewonderful, thanks to our Armenians, who received us. But it's not relaxing allthe same. I don't know how everyone else feels about it, but for me it's torture. We don't have a place to call our own. I had a two bedroom apartment in Sumgait, my children went to school and we lived well, in friendship. It's painful that in our times, in 1988, in the Soviet period, people can break into our apartment and try to kill me and my children, in whom I've put all myefforts and my whole youth. Everything was going well for us: my older daughter was studying at the Institute, the middle one was preparing to enter medical school and was interning as an orderly, and my youngest had been sick for a long time, but had returned to health. I have been though a lot in my life: it's been seven years since I lost my husband, I raised my children by myself. Lots of women have similar fates, but there's nothing to be done aboutit. But I can't control myself when I remember what happened in Sumgait on February 27, 28, and 29, it was just a horror, it's indescribable.On February 27 our relative, Ira, came to visit us. She's better friends withmy oldest daughter, and so right away she asked, "Where's Vika?" I say,"Vika's off in Pirkuli on a trip for three days, she's supposed to come backtomorrow." My middle daughter, Gaya, had baked a cake and we sat there talkingand laughing, drinking tea. Then Gaya and Diana went to walk Ira home.They left and a few minutes went by; suddenly I hear noise. I raced out tothe balcony--our balcony is right across from the bus station, we live at thecorner of Mir and Druzhba Streets--I look and see that there are hoards ofpeople near the bus station and they're all shouting something. What they'reshouting I can't understand. Our neighbor is standing on his balcony, too. Iask, "Nufar, what's happened?" He says, "I don't know, I can't figure it outeither." I got scared--the kids had gone outside, and I wanted to run afterthem, but then there was a knock at the door. I open the door and it's thekids. "Mamma," says Gayane, "you'll never believe what's going on out there! It's awful!" Ira says, "Aunt Zina, they're shouting, 'Karabagh! Karabagh! Karabagh is ours!' We didn't know what was going on. They're threatening to drive out the Armenians and slaughter them."I called my brother, and his wife answered the phone. I said, "Aunt Tamara, don't worry, Ira is staying here with us, and we'll see her home later." I couldn't shut my eyes all night long, even until morning. I was worried aboutVika. My God, what was going on, what had happened?!-Gayane: That day, on the 27th, we stood on the balcony and observed what was happening, although Mamma wouldn't allow us to watch all of it. There weren't 50 yards between our building and the bus station. We could see and hear everything perfectly. They were stopping buses, dragging people out, leading all the passengers out, looking for Armenians. If they found an Armenian on the bus, then it started . . .I don't know what to call it . . .-Zinaida: It's called slaughter.-Gayane: The mob would descend on people and beat them. I don't know if they were killing them or not, but when they left them, they lay still, not moving,as though nothing was left of them. One person was lying there and they started dragging him. The police were standing right there, to the side, not doing anything, they didn't take any steps to calm that mob.It was awful to stand there and watch it all from the balcony. And you couldn't go anywhere, somehow . . . you wanted to be able to see everythingso as to tell of it later. We wanted to leave Sumgait that day. What kept uswas the idea that we live in the Soviet Union, and that something would bedone about it. Where in the world was our government?!-Zinaida: We couldn't leave town, of course, because our older daughter wasn'thome. And at the same time I was terrified for Gaya and Diana. On Sunday morning when I went to see Ira home, our neighbor said, "Zin', you know they went into Valodya's house and smashed everything he had. They murdered his father and two sons." Valodya is our neighbor, he's an Armenian, he lives on the first floor. I think, my God, what is happening?! And in broad daylight!I saw Ira home and when on the way back I came across a mob shouting "Slay theArmenians! Karabagh is ours!" This was at 12 o'clock in the afternoon. On the way I stopped into a bread store and the saleswoman says, "They beat our storemanager, they thought he was an Armenian and they beat him, but he was an Azerbaijani." And I asked, "Did they kill him?" She says, "No, he's in seriouscondition." I left there and started to walk home on that same street, but themob started moving in my direction. I turned off the street and went down the little way that goes toward the Sputnik store. There I met another crowd, but these weren't bandits, these were our people from Sumgait. I was so frightenedthat I walked without knowing where was going, I couldn't feel my legs or the ground under my feet. I was walking and there was a boy standing before my eyes. This was on the 27th, around evening time. He ran under our balcony, andthe mob surged toward him shouting, "He's an Armenian, get him!" He wore a black coat. They grabbed him, that boy, near the bus stop, I saw it. They grabbed him by the legs and struck his head on the asphalt.I made it home but I just couldn't calm down. My oldest daughter was in my thoughts. I was thinking, my daughter's coming home now, they'll stop her bus and she'll be gone. There's no police, no protection, nothing. It's like they had all died, there's no one, nothing, no authorities whatsoever. I can't evenfind the words for it! I look and see an Ikarus arriving. Before going to the bus station they stop near our place, across from the Kosmos movie theater. Sothis Ikarus stops  there and the gang is yelling, the Azerbaijanis are runningtoward it yelling, "Armenians out!" And I see them take the Armenians and beatthem, killing them. I can't watch it any more. It was a nightmare. I just couldn't watch it. But Gaya was standing there watching it, and I scolded her.She says, "Mamma, I have to see it, I have to know what's happening, I have tosee it with my own eyes so I can tell our people of it later. So our children will know."Gayane: We saw a great deal on the 27th. They caught no less than 20 peoplebefore my eyes. I can't say for sure if they killed them or not . . .-Zinaida: There were too many people there, the mob was too big. You couldn't make anything out. But I saw that boy in the black coat with my own eyes. Hewas 18 or 19 years old.-Gayane: I think he was older, probably, about 22. A tall fellow, a big guy, in a coat. He was walking quickly, but when they shouted that he was anArmenian, he tore off running. And the mob went after him. They caught him right under our balcony. I don't know. I don't think there could have been much left of him after that. You can imagine what happens when a crowd attacksone person. It was a mob, big, angry, and featureless. You know, there was a similarity in the way they were dressed, mostly they were wearing long black coats. You couldn't even tell them apart, they were all wearing black and theyall looked alike.-Zinaida: When they picked up that boy and struck him against the asphalt and he cried "Mamma!" I ran into the room. I couldn't watch any longer. An awful lot was going on right then, in various places, it wasn't only that boy, several people were being beaten up. You couldn't see all of it at once, but when that boy cried "Mamma!" I immediately started watching only him.-Gayane: On that first day it went on from about six in the morning untiltwelve at night. At midnight they dispersed and the police took their place.They were scattered about in all districts. But how can you explain the factthat by morning, when it had already started getting light, around seveno'clock, our police were gone? The police disappeared and yielded theirpositions to the bandits. In the morning they started gathering at our inter-section again, at the bus station and at the entrance to downtown. Frommorning on all the roads and mass transit stops were covered, and by nineo'clock you couldn't even see the ground. There were thousands of people inthe crowd. Again they began stopping vehicles and checking for Armenians.-Zinaida: They had signals. I realized that when I noticed that they made a cross with their arms, they crossed their arms over their heads. The cross,evidently, meant that the vehicle had Armenians in it. They let theAzerbaijani cars through, and they stopped the Armenian ones and startedtheir pogrom.-Gayane: They stopped a white Zhiguli and asked the driver what his nationality was. He got out and said they were from Baku. "But what is yournationality?" He says Armenian. They immediately start shouting, "Ermeni,Ermeni!" And he says, "What's going on? I'm coming from Baku. I don't livein Sumgait." "Doesn't matter, who cares if you're from Baku or Sumgait."Anyway the crowd pounced on him and started beating him, and they dragged a woman--his wife, probably--out of the car. At this point the police came and took the two and led them away. Then the mob started smashing the car, and then burned it. The flames blazed . . . it was a horrible fire! Then everyone ran away, they thought the car was going to explode. About 20 minutes later another car comes along, a green Moskvich. They ran up shouting "Ermeni! Ermeni!" But this time they didn't pull the people out of the car, they didn'tbeat them. Maybe they burned them along with the car, because no one emerged from the flames. The neighbor boy Vakhit was standing on the balcony too, acquaintances of his walked by below, and he asked them and they said, "Yes, they burned them along with the car." About two hours later a whole wedding procession came by, and there was a doll on the first car. We thought they were Armenians, but the cars started to honk loudly. They were Azerbaijanis, and they were immediately allowed through.-Zinaida: The driver waved his hand as if to say 'get out of the way.' Thewhole crowd parted and the procession passed through freely.-Gayane: By the way, at the marriage hall, which is right in the courtyardof our building, there was a wedding that day. The Azerbaijanis were cele-brating and dancing. On the streets there was grief and death, people werebeing killed, and people were celebrating the whole time.-Zinaida: Before the apartment itself was attacked I asked Gaya to call and find out when the tourist bus was supposed to arrive. She went to her girlfriend's in the building, she lives in the first entryway, on the third floor. Gaya came back and said, "Mamma, the bus is supposed to come aroundeight, after eight." You can imagine what I was feeling, how hard it was:Vika knew nothing about what was happening and was coming to meet her death. Then I heard shouting. I raced to the window and see that the belongings of our neighbors from the second entryway are being thrown outdoors. They were thrashing about with the pillows and the feathers were lying like snow. I started to cry. I am walking around the room, crying, wailing: Vika's not here, what will come of her . . . Gaya, of course, was consoling me: "Mamma, nothing will happen to her, don't worry, calm down, she's in good company, they'll look out for her."Diana: I saw the green car burn. The car was burning when we went out onto thebalcony. Gaya pushed me away, telling me to get off the balcony. I left. Then they came up to the balcony and asked if there were any Armenians here.-Zinaida: You're right, I forgot about that, that was on the 27th.Diana: There's a small, grassy area in front of our balcony; there are treesplanted there. The mob asked if there were any Armenians in the building.All the neighbors said, no, there are no Armenians here. There weren't a lotof Armenians in our building, but there weren't just a few Armenian families, either.-Gayane: They fell upon the apartments on the 28th. There were terribly many of them. Our courtyard is huge, and it was completely filled with them.-Zinaida: Katusev had made an appearance on television earlier. He said that two people, Azerbaijanis, had been killed in Karabagh. And when he said that . . . you know how bees sound, have you heard how they buzz? It was like the buzzing of millions of bees . . . and with this buzzing they flew into our courtyard, howling and shouting. I don't know how to describe it. By this point we were afraid to watch from the balcony, but when I looked out of the bedroom window--the Znaniye Bookstore is down there, and Armenians live on the second and fourth floors--I saw their things being thrown out the windows. I realized that they would be upon us any minute. I shouted to Gayane, "Gaya, hide the gold." That's honestly what I told my child. I grabbed Diana. I didn't know what to do! Vika still wasn't home, and it was already getting dark. I was afraid to look at the time because I was already horrified as it was.-Gayane: Just in case, we changed the television channel from the Moscow station to the Azerbaijani one.-Zinaida: And turned it up loud.-Gayane: We never listened to Azerbaijani music. It just didn't do much for us. In all those years we almost never listened to it. But sometimes we wouldwatch some entertainment show or film on Azerbaijani television. And that was it. And here we had it turned up full blast. So they would think we were Azerbaijanis.-Zinaida: Well you can imagine, they're slaughtering Armenians, robbing them, and we're listening to this concert music from Baku. Our Azerbaijani neighborssuggested we do it, they knocked on the door and told Gaya to turn on Azerbaijani music. But we already had it on anyway. Turn on the lights, they told us, so they will think you're not Armenians. They're saying the Armeniansare afraid to turn on their lights, they're hiding.-Gayane: Apparently there was some kind of arrangement, because we noticed that the lights were off only in Armenian apartments, that is, the Azerbaijanis were warned, and every last one of them had their lights on.When we turned the lights off two of our neighbors came immediately, andlater, another one. "Turn on the lights," they told us, "please. Nothing willhappen. Be calm. Nothing will happen."-Zinaida: "We won't allow them to come into your apartment."-Gayane: We believed those people. We had never done anything bad to them.  -Zinaida: After the whole nightmare, about March 15, before we left forArmenia, when I was coming into the building they were all crying. TheAzerbaijanis were crying, saying, "Can it be there is no God? How couldthey raise their hands against your family? You never did anyone any harm,you never refused anyone anything, not in hard times, or in time of fortune,or in time of mourning. How could they give you away? How could they sell you down the river?" They really had given us away. Some of them protected us, butothers gave us away. They sold us down the river.-Gayane: I was wearing slacks that day, and when it all began I became cautious for some reason and I changed my clothes. Azerbaijani women don't wear pants. Young Armenian and Russian girls in Sumgait wore pants, but the Azerbaijanis found that very strange. And I thought I better put on a skirt, otherwise they won't believe me if I told them we were Azerbaijanis. There wasnothing else we could do. No other way out. I was forced to turn myself into God knows who. I let my hair down, tousled it, and threw a scarf over my head.-Zinaida: And she told me, "Mamma, you hide. Take Diana and go into the other room. You two look more like Armenians. They'll figure out that we're Armenians right away." But how could I go away and leave her there?!-Gayane: I went out onto the balcony. It worked out better that way. We were the only Armenian family in the fourth entryway. This gave us hope: we were the only ones, the neighbors wouldn't let them in. They, the Azerbaijanis, would fear for themselves and for their children. I looked and saw someone crawling up on the balcony from below, it was easy to get up onto our balcony.When we would lose the keys the neighbors would let up into their places and we would crawl across onto our balcony and get in that way. So I turned aroundand saw a guy with a knife on our balcony. He looks at me and shouts, "What nationality are you here?"-Zinaida: At the same time they were knocking on the door.-Gayane: "What nationality are you?" he's shouting. Well at first I wasfrightened, but then I got control of myself and answered in perfect Azerbaijani, "You should be ashamed of yourself, asking a question like that.Can't you see I'm an Azerbaijani? If I were an Armenian would I come out to meet you face to face and look you in the eyes?" He looks at me and tells thepeople with him, "Yes, Azerbaijanis live here." From below they tell him,"Check it out, it can't be, they have to be Armenians." And he asks me again,"What nationality are you?" I say, "Can't you see?" I started fuming. I couldnot say anything else. "You're blind, that's for sure! You can yell all youwant, but that won't make us Armenians." I hear them breaking down ourdoor, and Mamma went toward the door. I say, "I don't have time to dealwith you, they're breaking down our door." 1 go to the door and ask, "Who isit?" They answer, "Open up!" I say, "Wait, why are you breaking the door?What's going on? I'm opening up." We never locked the lower lock, it wasbroken, but now they had locked it out of fear, and I couldn't get it open. Isay wait, I'm looking for the key. I opened the door--it was almost brokendown already. I opened the door and they burst in. I say, "What's going on?Why are you breaking down our door?"-Zinaida: Then they started climbing in from the balcony. They're shouting, "Why don't you open the door?" And I say, "Well you've already come in the balcony." Then Diana sees their knives, runs into the bathroom, and closes thedoor. Gaya cries out, "Mamma, Diana ran into the bathroom!" I ran to the door and forgot that we were pretending to be Azerbaijanis, and said in Armenian: "Diana, open the door!" Gaya tried to calm them down, and I'm shouting withtears in my eyes for Diana to open the door.-Diana I was sitting on the couch with my doll, Little Red Riding Hood. That guy climbed in from the balcony with a big knife with a yellow handle. They put it up to Mamma's stomach. I ran to the bathroom, opened the door, and slammed it behind me. I was frightened, and started to cry. I shouted, "Mamma,they want to kill you!" And then . . . then they started shouting, "Give us your passports." And Gaya says, "What do you need passports for, we're Azerbaijanis."-Gayane: I tried to convince them that we were Azerbaijanis, I was tryingeverything I could, I could get on my knees and plead. I could humble myself, because at that moment I was worried about other lives than just my own. To behonest I didn't care about anything else, as long as my little sister would survive, her life and health had cost us so dearly! I tell them, "What, don't you understand anything?" They started shouting, they were tremendously excited, shouting with terribly loud voices, saying that in Stepanakert their girls were being killed, raped, and tossed around with pitchforks. Why shouldn't they do the same to us? I said, "Who's doing all that? Who is doing it? Some Armenians! What does that have to do with us? Give me the knife, I'llcut my own face." "Now you calm down," they tell me.Zinaida: I told them, "Why didn't you deal with them there! There, in Karabakh? Nothing has happened here, no one has been fighting here, not we with the Armenians, nor they with us. Why didn't you give it right back tothem there? What've we got to do with this?" I got confused. I had beensaying that we were Azerbaijanis, but suddenly I started speaking as thoughI were an Armenian, but they didn't notice. One of them was next to me,with a knife at my breast. And he says to the others, "What pretty girls." Hemeant Gaya and my 10-year-old Diana. I was terrified. Gaya started assuring them that we were Azerbaijanis. One guy stood in the doorway and gave us bad looks.-Gayane: He demanded the passports. I said, "Young man, I don't have my passport here." He says, "Let's have the passport, we won't believe youwithout your passport." And one of them started hurriedly searching fordocuments. They turned the wardrobe in the other room upside down, took the picture off the wall, and started pulling the clothes off their hooks, yellingand shouting, "Passport! Passport!" They all started yelling, there was so much noise in the apartment. They were all shouting. My hair stood on end. Suddenly I said, "Listen, my Papa died, 40 days haven't passed yet, we have a Muslim household, we're in mourning, you should be ashamed of yourselves, you've disgraced your honor." And then Mamma started to cry.-Zinaida: I started crying: "My husband died, 40 days haven't yet passed,aren't you ashamed of yourselves!" In fact my husband had died seven yearsearlier, in 1981. "We're in mourning, and you burst in here demanding docu-ments. The documents are at the housing office, I'm filing for my pension."Well it seemed like they believed us. Then one guy said, "They're Lezgins.Can't you see, there are no men here, only women. Leave." Another fellow inthe group agreed with him, he also said that we were Lezgins. But a thirdsaid, "No, they're Armenians." Well the other two convinced him, I don t know how, and all the rest of them listened to them too. There were about 50 of them, if not more, all in our three-room apartment, even the entryway was filled. They started leaving. Yes, we're Lezgins, we're Lezgins." They startedleaving, and one of them took our tape recorder with him. And the one who had first called us Lezgins says, "Leave that, what are you doing?" They seemed toobey that guy.-Gayane: He was tall, wearing baggy jeans and a coat.-Zinaida: With a little moustache, I think.-Gayane: No, he didn't have a moustache, he was tall with brown hair, he wasn't a bad-looking sort. He didn't have anything in his hands.-Zinaida: He stood at the threshold.-Gayane: Yes, he didn't look like a bad guy, and you know, his face seemed familiar to me. I had seen him somewhere. And more than once. But I can't remember where. When he came in I was stupefied, I had a premonition that he wouldn't be able to remain indifferent. When he said that we were Lezgins and that they should leave, such gladness started to glow inside of me. Hope. Theycontinued to argue on their way out. Some said, "They're Armenians all the same." And that fellow answered, "even if they are Armenians, it's shameful,the father died, they're mourning, there's nothing but women in the house, there's no men. We should stay out of the apartment." "What do you mean, stay out? We can go in there!" And he said, "No, we should stay out, they're Lezgins, we're leaving here." The three of them protected us.   -Zinaida: No, the two of them. The one in the short coat and the one in thegrey suit, who stood at the threshold, about 19 or 20 years old. Well theywere all young really. The two of them defended us.-Diana: Three, three!-Zinaida: Do you remember the third one, Diana?-Diana: Yes, he was wearing dark clothes.-Gayane: The third one was the one who came back. He wore a long brown coat.-Diana: He wore a long, darkish brown coat, and his hair was dark too. When they left, they told him downstairs that those women were Armenians, and ran back and said that they were going to kill us.-Zinaida: They had all left, and we had started to calm down a little, and Iclosed the door. And then there is a knock. I told Gaya, "Take Diana and gointo the other room." My daughters went into the dining room, and I opened thedoor. There was a guy there who said, "Run, hide! They're coming to kill you now!" We ran up to the third floor. We had some good neighbors up there,Azerbaijanis. I sent the kids and stood there alone, not knowing what to do. I was so far gone . . . Out of a whole room I couldn't even think of anything to take. I even forgot to take my work documents; at the time I had been preparing a report to send to Baku, and the documents were at home. I couldn'tsee anything . . . I could only see Vika, my older daughter. I sent Gaya and Diana upstairs, and stood there asking that fellow, "Should I close the door and leave everything like this?" He says, "What do you mean, door? Get out of here, they're coming to kill you! What are you standing there for?" And I ran after the children.-Gayane: We barely had time to get up to the third floor when they burst into our apartment and started shouting, "Where are the Armenians?" We were alreadyat the neighbors'. They had an infant at the time, and the neighbor said, "Don't you worry, I'm not letting anyone in this apartment no matter what."-Zinaida: On the third floor there I started asking the folks, our neighbors,to go meet Vika. The bus was due to arrive at eight o'clock. I dissolved intears, Gaya was soothing me, Diana was next to us, she was crying too, and I'malready thinking that I've lost my older daughter, but deep in my heart I still believe she's alive . . . And my tears choked me. I was going out of mymind. But no one could leave the building, the courtyard was packed withpeople, swarming with them. From the balcony the neighbor in whose apartment we were hiding asked the bandits, "Where are those Armenians, the ones who were at home? Where did they make off to?" They told him they didn't know. They asked him where he lived. He answered, "Can't you see, on the third floor." He asked them specially to divert attention from his own apartment. Weheard them taking free reign of our apartment, and they threw our color television off the balcony and it exploded.-Gayane: Mamma was crying the whole time. She fell into a faint and we broughther around and held her back, because the whole time she kept making for the door to go outside, alternately raving and sobbing, shouting, and calling Vika. She didn't notice us, probably because we were next to her. Her thoughtswere only on Vika. The neighbors who were hiding us were calming her too, offering tea.-Zinaida: We are very grateful to them. Thanks to them my children and I arealive, well, and unharmed. When they were throwing our belongings out and burning them--the beds, the pillows, and the chairs--our neighbor came to us and said, "How lucky you are that it's not you standing there naked, but some other woman instead. You're from our part of the building you lost your husband, you have children, thank God you're not in her position, we wouldn't have been able to take it. I don't know what I would do." He of course wouldn't have done anything, he was just trying to calm us down. In the yard they were torturing our neighbors, fellow Armenians They lived on the fifth floor, in the third entryway. A married couple, Vanya and Nina, and their three children. Their last name is V. They hid their two daughters, and stayedwith their son to defend themselves, they even got boiling water ready, and anaxe, and held them off for a long time, but the . . . They beat up the husband, dragged the wife outside, and stood her naked next to our burning things; her husband was lying at her feet on the ground. The crowd shouted, "Look at the naked Armenian!" They were going to throw the poor woman into thefire. The neighbors came out, an Azerbaijani woman threw her a scarf, and she covered herself with it, and the neighbors led her off to their apartment. All the neighbors saw and heard it . . .-Gayane: Mamma wouldn't allow it but I went to the window and saw her standingthere, and they took skewers that had been heated in the fire and stuck them into her body. Our neighbor, who lived in the same entryway as Nina--she lives with us in the same boarding house now--saw what they had done, Nina showed her, from her knees up, almost up to her neck, her whole body was covered, riddled, with wounds.-Zinaida: In the morning, during the night of the 29th, rather, after oneo'clock, two buses approached the station. I wanted to run out. By then Ididn't care any more if I lived or died, but Gayane wouldn't let me go, andthe neighbors said that I would bring disaster to them and they would beslain along with their children. Gaya was crying and said that I forgot aboutthem, my other children, but I could only think of Vika. I imagined her tornto pieces, I'm a mother, and they're just children, they don't understand Iwould have jumped off the balcony and run to the soldiers for help. I wasgoing to do it but Gayane wouldn't let me: "Mamma, please! Mamma, I beg of you!" The neighbors were sleeping and Gayane woke them with her cries. So we held on that way till morning.On the morning of the 29th I told our neighbor I was going to go downstairs toour apartment, maybe Vika was lying there, murdered. He told me he would go himself. He was gone for about five minutes, but it seemed like an eternity tome. He returned and said there was no one there, nothing. I went down too, stole down like a mouse, and slipped in everything was thrown all about. I didn't go to the soldiers because the armored personnel carriers were far away, farther than the bus station. I began looking for the briefcase with my work in it. I was miserable because of my daughter, and at the same time because of my work. My documents were there, my travel papers--I worked in thetransport division -- and my trip sheets.-Gayane: Mamma is a very responsible person, she was always ready to work around the clock to do her job.-Zinaida: I look around and I can't find the briefcase. I didn't care about the fact that everything had been stolen out of all three of my rooms, thateverything was smashed, and the furniture was broken, I worried about thatlater, but at first I was concerned about the lost documents. I went into thekitchen. My daughter had hidden some valuables in the gas stove: my ring and my earrings. It was all there. Five minutes passed and Gayane ran in and said,"Mamma, hurry." And Diana came downstairs too. Gayane found  her coat among the debris, and Diana found her track shoes, her coat, and some of her dresses.-Diana: Immediately after we got back up to the neighbors they started throwing things around in the apartment under us. They threw a television ontothe asphalt, it exploded so violently it sounded like a thunderclap. Then, when Vika wasn't there, I wouldn't eat, and they forced me, but I couldn't eat. Because I loved Vika terribly and she and I had always gone to the moviesand gone for walks in the park. When we went into our apartment the next day and everything was broken, right away I started looking for my dolls and my books, but I didn't see anything. When we went back upstairs I managed to taketwo cups from my tea service, and Gaya took Vika's suit and one of her own dresses. My Italian boots were gone, my brown coat, it was beautiful, there wasn't a one of my beautiful dolls, and my giant lion was gone too, the one that had been on top of the television. He was very large and very handsome. I had two satchels, one for first grade and the other for second grade, one was yellow-green with a boy and a girl on it, they're playing a drum and a violin, and there is a dog sitting there closing its ears, and on the other one were the letters A, B, C, D, E and the numbers 4+5, two girls and a boy with their mouths open like they are singing. They were beautiful satchels. They were gone too. I had many books, I collected them, they were in the bedside tables. And a boy had given me a little apron and a headband for my birthday, they weren't around either. And I had some big books, fat ones, and they disappeared, only one was left, The Malachite Box. The Adventures of Karlson, Pippi Longstockings, and Fairy Tales of the World were left. All the other books were gone.-Zinaida: I continued searching for my briefcase, and then my supervisorarrived. He had waited for me until nine o'clock, but I didn't appear, and hethought something must have happened, so he came. He's a Russian, Aleksei Semyonovich Lomakin. Alik Aliyev, the mechanic, came with him. When they saw my wrecked apartment they were just petrified, they could not say a thing. When I saw them I started crying. My Azerbaijani neighbors came in. Some of them were crying, others were helping me pick up. I go on looking for my documents and at the same time put things into the wardrobe. Now that I remember it it's both funny and painful: How could I have thought that I had returned to my apartment and that everything had gone back to normal? Incidentally, later, when I went back to the apartment again those things weregone too. And the door was gone. After my supervisor left, in the afternoon, the neighbor said that we should leave, find another refuge. "I'm afraid," he said, "that someone saw you come to my apartment, and that they could kill youand us too. My God, where could I go it was daytime and those . . . I don't even know what to call them, the bandits, those marauders, those jackals, I don't know what to call them, I can't find the words, they were everywhere. Where should I go with two girls? When I opened the door I had tears in my eyes, and I was terrified . . . And he said, "Go to Alik's, he's anAzerbaijani, too." and I say, "You should have said that earlier, when my supervisor was here with the car, he could have taken us with him." Everyone feared for their own lives. What could I do? I went out into the entryway and stood. And he says, "any other time I would keep you here a year, or two. But right now, I'm sorry . . . " Then another door opened, also on the third floor. I ask the neighbor, "Tayara, can we hide at your place?" She's an Azerbaijani too. She says, "What kind of question is that? Come in!" She hid us. There were many people in the courtyard, and Gaya and I hid in the wardrobe, and they put Diana under a mattress, leaving a small opening so the child could breathe. Tayara said that when the bandits left she would let us out, and when they came back she would hide us again.We sat in the wardrobe for about a half hour. Gaya became ill, and I allowed her to get out. My legs fell asleep and felt like cannons. We hadn't eaten or drunk anything for so long, since the 27th, when we saw that horror--and all of it just snapped in me. Tayara's husband went outside, even though I begged him to stay, saying there should be a man in the house. He said that he'd be in the courtyard, and if anything happened his wife would signal him. She put her passport and all of their documents on the table so if they suddenly came in she could show them that they were an Azerbaijani family. My girls went to the window--and what was going on out there! I feared for my children, that someone would recognize them from the street. Gaya let her hair down and put on a scarf so she would resemble an Azerbaijani, but directly across there wasa 9-story building, their windows were right across from us, and I shouted that someone would see her and give us away on the spot. But she kept on looking.-Diana: I watched too.-Zinaida: Downstairs the bandits were fighting with the soldiers. The soldiersdidn't shoot, they didn't have orders to. I saw them throwing rocks atthe soldiers, they were young boys, 18- and 19-year olds, and they defendedthemselves . . . I'm a mother after all, and they were no different from mychildren. When one of the soldiers fell and his head started bleeding I had tostop looking, l couldn't watch anymore . . . I imagined my children in theirshoes . . .-Gayane: The troops had assumed their defense that morning and had cordoned off the buildings, and some of the soldiers surrounded the bus station, Block 36, and our Microdistrict 3. But they only cordoned them off from the outside.The mob fell upon the soldiers, who started to protect themselves, and the mobsurged into the courtyard with the soldiers after it. They caught several Azerbaijanis and started beating them with their clubs. One fell down and theycracked open another's head . . .-Zinaida: They show Lebanon on television, and the war in Afghanistan--that's justwhat it was like. Like in America, how they attack demonstrations with shieldsand clubs--that's just how it was in our courtyard.-Gayane: Don't compare it with America, those were peaceful demonstrations, but these?!-Zinaida: But how could it happen here and not off somewhere in America! They attacked the soldiers, hurled stones at them . . . Then I thought, where's thetear gas that the Americans use to disperse demonstrators? If they had used gas on those jackals they all would have scattered.-Gayane: They would not have scattered. The soldiers had been there since morning, they didn't bring in fresh troops. They hadn't eaten, they were fine standing there for about three hours, but then they got tired. They weren't even allowed to sit down . . . At noon they, the soldiers, attacked them, and then the tables were turned. The mob went after the soldiers, the guys were bunched into a group in the center street and covered themselves with their shields, and the Azerbaijanis surrounded them and threw paving stones at them.And those guys sat there covering themselves with their shields. And meanwhiletanks with machine guns were cruising the streets . . . They always say, "Our children have never seen war." I never even dreamed about it, there was no need to. But then I thought about those people who had lived through a war. Itwas truly horrible . . . The guys were tired, exhausted, some had had their clubs taken away, others, their shields, they had been beaten, they were covered in blood . . . so many died! They beat the soldiers with their own clubs and shields. And those guys stood there and couldn't defend themselves, they couldn't open fire. They couldn't even defend themselves, let alone us. It's comical . . .-Zinaida: What are you saying? How can it be funny?-Gayane: No, I didn't mean that: How could something like that happen during our Soviet period? It's painfully embarrassing! And they burned the armored personnel carriers, too. Someone shouted, "Get away, it's going to blow!" Everyone scattered away, and the armored personnel carrier exploded. The soldiers lost their senses. And when they drove the personnel carrier and the bus at the mob out of rage and fury, they drove right up on the sidewalk.-Zinaida: The bus that had brought the troops. Only the driver was in it. The bus ran over three people straight off, I saw it. And two armored personnel carriers ran over four more. All in one or two minutes. The bus ran over three, one of the carriers ran over two, and the second, two more. Right on our street there's a dry cleaners and appliance and watch repair places; one of the armored personnel carriers went that way, and they say it ran overseveral over there, too. But they ran over seven before our eyes. Then the busploughed into a book kiosk.-Gayane: No, that was a flower place. It was a new booth. He drove straight into it.-Zinaida: The driver jumped out and they dragged the vehicle out to themiddle of the road and set it on fire.-Gayane: And I also saw the troops put a bunch of Azerbaijanis in a bus and take them in a convoy to Baku. There were many arrests.-Zinaida: Our neighbor, the one who hid us, couldn't take it, and he told his wife that we should leave. They were running around in the courtyard looking for the Armenians. They knew that they were hiding with Azerbaijanis, and theywere saying that they were going to check the Azerbaijani families. Poor Tayara got scared too, and started to cry; I pleaded with her, I said that I would remember forever how she saved my children and me, but where could we go?-Gayane: She didn't make us leave, she said that she would do anything, but she was afraid.-Zinaida: I told Tayara that we would just stay a little longer and that atnight we would return to our apartment. Then her husband came back and said that a curfew had been imposed. He says, "Zina, you owe us a drink. Gorbachev announced a curfew." And Bagirov [First Secretary of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] was on television, he said that two people had been killed in Karabagh, but nothing was wrong, automobile windows had been broken, but therehadn't been any killings. He kept making statements, and there were Azerbaijani songs and dances. Tayara turned the TV all the way up. When we learned of the curfew we calmed down, but then a crowd ran into the courtyard again, a large one. Our neighbor told them that there had been only one Armenian family here, but they had already killed them all, there was no one left. We hid in the wardrobe again. and they stuck Diana back under the bed.-Gayane: Tayara went down to our apartment to see what was happened there, andfound two bandits. They asked her, "What are you doing here" Tayara answered, "I came to take something for myself." "Take all you want, they're gone now." -Zinaida: Yes, she had wanted to get something for us, at least some bedding. She said, "What are you going to do, empty handed, naked, with three children,nothing remains of your entire apartment." In short, we calmed down, and the crowd raced off to the other building, the one across from us. I don't know what went on there.-Gayane: The curfew had its effect on the gangs, many started to disperse:they were warned that they would open fire on them. The soldiers didn't know the city, they couldn't get oriented, they drove up and down the main streets,but didn't go into the courtyards. When we were at the City Party Committee they asked people from Sumgait to go with them and show them the way.-Zinaida: The tanks entered the city on the night of the 29th.-Gayane: No, Mamma, the tanks had been there earlier, but were near the City Party Committee, where the Armenians were . . . After midnight, on March 1, when I had finally gotten to sleep after two sleepless nights, Mamma said, "Get your things together, they have sent buses for us." As it was we had beendressed the entire time. Mamma went to check it out . . .and came back for us.-Zinaida: When I came back for the children Tayara said that Vika was alive and well, some guys had come and told her that they had hidden her in a safe place. I both believed it and didn't believe it. We ran out to the tanks. The Gambarians were there, Roman and Sasha; their father, Shurik, the clarinetist,was killed, and their mother was there. Sasha came over and asked about the girls. I was surprised, how did he know my girls? He said that he knew me and the girls. Our neighbor himself went for Gaya and Diana and it seemed like he was taking forever so I went after him. Another neighbor came out, Anna Vasilyevna, a Russian: "Zinochka, my dear, goodbye and good luck." She kissed Diana. They put us in the bus and the captain gave the order for us to be taken to the City Party Committee. The bus wouldn't start, so they put us on another one. It was pouring rain.-Diana: When they imposed the curfew there were many soldiers on the streets, and they all had clubs and shields. And when the Azerbaijanis attacked them, many of the soldiers died. They threw paving stones--huge rocks--at the soldiers. I saw this myself. The soldiers ran over those Azerbaijanis with thetanks. The soldiers saw that the Azerbaijanis were doing violence to people and they ran over them out of rage. We got scared and they hid me under a mattress and a blanket, and Gaya and Mamma crawled into the wardrobe. And theywere fighting right down there on the street . . . Near the building they wereblowing up buses and tanks, and cars were burning, and there were many dead inthe courtyard. They drove without looking to see if it was a sidewalk or a street, they just drove, and the ones who didn't manage to get out of the way were run over by the tanks. And when we left--it was evening, it was already dark--there were three buses, and one of them had soldiers in it. Mamma ran upand said, "Get your clothes on, let's go." Gaya was wearing slippers, and I had on my blue dress, but it was an old one. I was wearing my old jacket, my old dress, and slippers. And nothing else. Gaya had on a skirt, her Angora sweater, and slippers. It was raining hard, and there were puddles on the street. They gave Mamma an old coat because she was wearing a short-sleeved dress; she put it on and we ran out. We got onto the bus and I was hungry, oneof the soldiers from Yerevan gave me rations and carried me from one bus tothe other in his arms. I gave him the little glass that remained from Vika'strousseau, and he gave me his telephone number.-Gayane: In the bus there was a soldier with a shield sitting at every window.We had to be ready for anything. They took us to the City Party Committee, letus out, and then took us into the City Party Committee building under armed guard. It was jammed with people and you couldn't breathe. We asked, "Are these all us? Armenians?" They answered yes. We were surprised that there wereso many Armenians in Sumgait. All those years we lived there and didn't know there were so many Armenians, 18,000. We were struck by that, we had never noticed. Going downstairs the next day I ran into the Secretary of the Komsomol from Vika's plant, the Khimprom. He said that Vika was alive and well. When I told Mamma she of course calmed down some more. But you know, after all that it was hard to believe anything, our faith in everything was just gone. She didn't believe it completely.-Zinaida: I didn't believe it because I had heard all kinds of things. Whenwe arrived at the City Party Committee we heard everything imaginable! Itwas the fear of God. I saw many of our acquaintances, they were kissing each other and asking how their children and homes were. Many people already knew that there had been a pogrom of our apartment. They had seen the broken windows. I cried, saying that I didn't know where Vika was. One woman said that they had taken two of her daughters and that she couldn't find one of them; the other had been slashed all over. A second said that her husband andher son had been murdered. That was Nelli Aramian. She lived in Building 6 in our microdistrict. They killed her husband, Armo, and her son Artur. I heard so many things like that that I was already starting to lose touch; my patience had run dry waiting for my daughter. Later an Azerbaijani fellow cameto me and said, Aunt Zina, Vika sent me, she's alive and well and hidden in a safe place; if you want I'll call her there and you can speak with her. We went downstairs to the first floor and he called Vika. I spoke with her, heardthe voice of my child. She had managed to survive in that hell. Then I startedbegging that Azerbaijani to bring her to the City Party Committee. He tried totalk me out of it: "I'll bring her wherever you go, don't worry, I've looked after her better than a brother does a sister." All the same I asked him to get her. He brought her and I calmed down. On the second day there was a meeting with Demichev [Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of theCommunist Party of the USSR,] and people started shouting. One shouted, "Give me my son back!", another yelled, "Where is my daughter?!", a third wanted herhusband . . . Bagirov  was there too, and he stood there blinking, not saying anything.-Gayane: When Demichev asked where we wanted to go, everyone shouted, "ToRussia!" To be honest we were all frightened of Armenia, there were such wild rumors it was as though we were in a terrible dream, and no one wanted to go to Armenia. But he said that he couldn't evacuate 18,000 people to Russia and that he would meet with everyone individually the next day and speak with them. And he also said that today he was going to go look at all of our apartments. On March 3 we went to the military barracks in the village of Nasosny. We were taken care of marvelously by the military. They sent special flights of children right from there to Minvody, Yerevan, and Moscow. One woman left for Moscow with a letter for Gorbachev and Gromyko.-Zinaida: The worst was truly behind us by then. Everything had passed, but the pain will remain for our whole lives. It cannot be forgotten. Under no circumstances should we, our children, or our grandchildren forget. Who willanswer for those who died? For our mothers, sisters, brother, sons anddaughters? Who will bear the responsibility? Who will wash away their blood? Someone should be made to answer, and severely, so it has an effect on the people that did with us as they pleased . . . It isn't over yet, now we live here, in Armenia, protected, but the issue isn't resolved. We would liketo stay in Armenia, in our homeland, so that all the Armenian people will beunited. Then we will be invincible. Armenians won't be scattered throughout the Soviet Union, about the world, and if we're all together this won't happenagain. As a mother of three children, as a woman, as a sister, I ask Armeniansto be united so that what happened in Sumgait will never happen again. Our homeland . . . The only request we have is that we be helped in obtaining an apartment and getting jobs. So that our children can work for the good of Armenia. If we aren't able to, then let our children do it. And if it's possible, we'll work for the good of Armenia too. This is the land of our forefathers. Our grandfathers and great-grandfathers lived here too, it was only later that people dispersed all over. Like a mother, the land here bore and reared us. It is our wife, and will protect us, too. I want but one thing:that our people never see the hardship that our children saw, that your children here, in Armenia, never see anything like it.

This is a critical point in the history of world and we can make a change otherwise thingswill not change there in Bosnia.. Rapes/killings/ethnic cleansing willgo on as a norm in the days to follow. The UN will get to the towns after the fallof thousands of inocent civilians (like in Zapa just the past weekend!). It happenedto the Jews in 1940's, it's happening to the muslims today and who will be the nextvictim??Since the Europeans want to remain indifferent in this issue, time has come for US totake a leadership role to stop these crimes against humanity. Time is now andthis is for real folks, the people of New England Bosnian Relief Committee seriously believethat Clinton's Adminstration will stop supporting the Bosnian cause without sustainedpublic pressure. I just called Democaratic Sen. John Kerry's office and they are saying that he (the senator) is waiting for president to take a decision, means that he will wait and join the band-wagon later if it ever moves! Please don't rely on others to take part in this demonstration -You as an individualwill make a big difference. Bring your families too, not only you will help a greatcause but also it will be fun for all. I know of several families from Massachusettswho are travelling friday night to participate there. Contact the local Islamic centeror Bosnia relief agency if you want to travel by pre-arranged busses. The best option for students is to rent-a-car and car-pool. Please, spread the word around...Regards,Khalid Chishti If you live in Massachusetts and want more info:Call Ginan (from New England Bosnian Relief Committee): 617-623-1973 OR New England Bosnian Relief Committee phone no:  (617) 464-0111Disclaimer: These are my opinions only and has nothing to do with my employer...

"Muslim" in ex-Yugoslavia was a *nation* not a religion.  In fact, notall Muslims in B-H are followers of Islam.  Therefore, there do (did?)exist in ex-Yugoslavia "Christian Muslims."  Tito defined the Muslim nation constitutionally, adding Muslims to Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes,the three founding nations which entered into a voluntary union at theend of WWI.  In addition, Tito added two other nations constitutionally:Montenegrins, and Makedonijans. Nations had the right of secession, but republics did not.  So, "Muslim"is much more a political term than a religious term (for those who differentiate between religion and politics, that is) in B-H.  It was not a "Christo-Slavic" ideology that made a Muslim nation in Yugoslavia, itwas the "Atheist Communist" ideology of Tito.  Before Tito, there wasno Muslim nation in Yugoslavia.  The war is not a religious war, and it is not an ethnic war.  It is acivil war in which the terms of secession are being negotiated with gunsinstead of pens.  The Croat, Muslim, and Serb political leaders *all*chose to fight over the terms of secession instead of compromising andpeacefully negotiating multilateral secession agreements. -Nick

Will anybodyA typical Armenian revisionist. As in the past in x-Soviet Armenia, and today in Azerbaijan, for utopic and idiotic causes the Armeniansbrought havoc to their neighbors. A short-sighted and misplacednationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda and anachronistic methodsthe Armenians continue to become pernicious for the region. As usual,they will be treated accordingly by their neighbors. Nagorno-Karabag is a mountainous enclave that lies completely within Azerbaijan with no border or history whatsoever connected to x-Soviet Armenia. Besides the geographical aspect, Nagorno-Karabag is the historic homeland and the 'cradle' of the artistic and literary heritage of Azerbaijan, which renders the Armenian claims preposterous, even lunatic. No one in his or her mind could have imagined that one day such a devious turn of event could have plagued the Azeris. One cannot even imagine the reverse case to occur, for the Armenians either would have slaughtered the Azerbaijanis, or put them to forced exile to maintain their own majority. Where was she?                An Appeal to MankindDuring the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinationalpopulation are vainly fighting for justice within the limits ofthe Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rightsguaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of HumanRights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums,documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated.The USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijanthough they are all empowered to take necessary measures toguarantee life and peace.The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow'stacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation againstAzerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupiedand annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanlydeported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland.Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have alsobeen driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan.Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the CentralAsia where the President and government bodies did not guaranteethem the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only againstAzerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is theArmenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientificexperimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance,for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis areviolated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled,its people are shot. There is persistent negative image ofAzerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over the whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in theUSSR and the United States. One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves andgenerated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerancewhile the truth is that all these shootings and recent events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia onAzerbaijan.It is a well documented fact that before the conflict therewere no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on theissue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidlyand calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had theirrepresentatives in all government bodies of the AzerbaijanSSR.We are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by oneof the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon theSoviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionistsencouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the neighboring lands.The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales,suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.But what about the lives of seven million human beings?If these people are Muslims, does it mean that they areless valuable? Can people be discriminated by their colour of skin or religion, by their residence or otherattributes?All people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothersfor help and understanding.

Diplomats and aidworkers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one ofthe last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full controlof Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiationsin Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fightingretreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of thedead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was firstsuppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-strickenAzerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000dead.The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  "HojaliDisaster", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum onpreliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  ElmanMemmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed inthe Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and morethan 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswomanof the Azeri Ministry of Defence.FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the InternationalRed Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city ofAgdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosquefrom  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. "We  did  not count  thebodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy," MrZen Ruffinen said. "We have some idea since we gave the body bagsand products to wash the dead."Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  thenumber of  dead in the  massacre. "Don't  get worked up.  It willtake  several months  to  get a  final  figure," the  43-year-oldlawyer said at his small office.Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years toreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalistuprising in Baku in January 1990.Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  powerthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactlywhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, beingthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by therepublic's forensic department. "This  is just a small percentageof the dead," said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensicscientist. "They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember thechaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and buryour dead within 24 hours."Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 andaxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highlandsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs ofdeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penisescut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov'sreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of thosebelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  stilldisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, sixpolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, thenames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. Themost heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so farcomes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  ahelicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27February."There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground tocount properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the streamand the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village," MrManafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopterpilot."People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children andone  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  waspulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land butArmenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had toreturn."There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  incirculation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last fewmonths and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojaliat the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villagestaken over by Armenian forces.THE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92HEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIESAREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  theCaspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches inhis trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town ofHojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope."I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,"the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  theHojali disaster. "I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky tobe alive."Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricityfor more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on theedge of Karabakh."At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heardbefore,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavymachine-guns, the lot," Mr Sadikov said.Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the directionof  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  startedfleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through thesnow into a forest on the other side.To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdamabout 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it,until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the twoArmenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak."None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted bya  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started openingfire," Mr Sadikov said.Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forwardto force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their effortswere mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from hisgroup of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiamanson.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his67-year-old elder brother."I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,"he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. "Wehave never got any of the bodies back."The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as hestruggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group'scrossing, Mr Sadikov said.Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he andseveral others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushyhillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep threeArmenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there waslittle comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population wassoon to flee."The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenianrocket attack. Some people just  kept going," Mr Sadikov said. "Ihad to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way.They even found a bullet in my sock."Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in theHojali massacre in February  (left).

The estimated population of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem. Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the  Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897, however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character  notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian  Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the  southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia."

During the course of evening I asked  Ohanus if he could tell me anything of the history of the village and  the cause of its destruction. In his matter of fact way he replied, Yes,  I assisted in its sack and destruction, and witnessed the slaying of  those whose bones you saw to-day scattered among its ruins." p. 202 (first and second paragraphs)."We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as  ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work  of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village.  Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts  into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable  and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets  completed the work.

They are quiet now, those villages, except for  howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the  scattered bones of the dead." p. 15 (second paragraph)."The Tartars were, for the most part, poor. Some of them lived in villages  and cultivated small farms; many of them continued in the way of life of  their nomadic forefathers. They drove their flocks and herds from valley  to valley, from plain to mountain, and from mountain to plain, following  the pasturage as it changed with the seasons. They ranged from the salt  desert shores of the Caspian Sea far into the mighty Caucasus Mountains.  Even the village Tartars are a primitive people, only semicivilized.""I can see now that we Armenians frankly despised the Tartars, and, while  holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country, regarded and treated them as inferiors. The fact that the Russians looked down upon all Armenians in much the same way as Armenians regarded Tartars, far from proving a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors, intensified an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility."p. 20 (second paragraph)."Our men armed themselves, gathered together and advanced on the Tartar section of the village. There were no lights in the houses and the doors were barred, for the Tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great  fear. Our men hammered on the doors, but got no response; whereupon they smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last Tartar was slain. Throughout the hideous night, I cowered at home in terror, unable to shut my ears to the piercing screams of the helpless victims and the loud shouts of our men. By morning the work was finished."p. 109 (second paragraph)."As things were, the members of the Dashnack Party were without administrative experience; consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself incompetent to rule by legitimate means. The members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and outside the law. When they became a legally instituted, recognized governing body with the destiny of Armenia in their hands, they proved incompetent to  do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their  fight against the Russian and Turkish Governments in their outlaw days. The outstanding feature of their rule, now that they were in power, was, as in the old days, trial and execution without hearing. A man evoking the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him. The method  of execution was for a government 'mauserist' to walk up behind the condemned man in his home or on the street, place a pistol to the back of his head and blow out his brains. This simple way of getting rid of those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became a common way of paying debts."p. 203 (first paragraph)."A soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the Tartar. I saw the point of the weapon emerge through his back. ...Another soldier seized a rock  and pounded the Tartar's head with it... The Armenian who had bayoneted him sprang to his feet, wrested the weapon from the Tartar's body, and, raising it to his lips, licked it clean of blood, exclaiming in Russian, 'Slodkey! Slodkey!' (Sweet.)"p. 203 (second paragraph)."One evening I passed through what had been a Tartar village. Among the  ruins a fire was burning. I went to the fire and saw seated about it a group of soldiers. Among them were two Tartar girls, mere children. The girls were crouched on the ground, crying softly with suppressed sobs. Lying scattered over the ground were broken household utensils and other furnishings of Tartar peasant homes. There were also bodies of the dead."p. 204 (first paragraph)."I was soon asleep. In the night I was awakened by the persistent crying of a child. I arose and went to investigate. A full moon enabled me to make my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy that had been enacted. Guided by the child's crying, I entered the yard of a house, which I judged from its appearance must have been the home of a Turkish family. There in a corner of the yard I found a women dead. Her throat had been cut. Lying on her breast was a small child, a girl about a year old."p. 118."Slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow, the cart jolting and the loads swaying. Boys ran along the line of oxen, encouraging them with shrill Tartar cries, and belaboring the beasts with sticks. In the carts, the women, veiled as is the Tartar way, held children in their arms. Wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they sought protection from the wind and cold. A few old men plodded along on foot. Across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown. The leading oxteam reached this barrier and halted. The gunmen and other ruffians  concealed among the rocks opened fire. Women and children leaped and scrambled from the carts, screamed, ran and sought vainly for safety. This massacre was not complete. The Armenian soldiers in the near-by  barracks, hearing the firing and the turmoil, hurried to the scene.... That same day the abandoned Tartar quarter of Alexandropol was looted and completely destroyed."p. 192."Great swarms of peasants who had come out of their hiding-places on the retreat of the Turks followed our army as it advanced.... They entered into the city with the army and immediately began plundering the stores that had been left by the Turks."p. 193."Terrible vengeance was taken upon Tartars, Kurds and Turks. Their villages were destroyed and they themselves were slain or driven out of the country."p. 195."The fanatical Dashnacks hated the Turks above all others and then in order of diminishing intensity: Tartars, Kurds and Russians." p. 218. (First and second paragraphs)"Russian troops did terrible things in the Turkish villages...We Armenians  did not spare the Tartars....If persisted in, the slaughtering of prisoners,  the looting, and the rape and massacre of the helpless become commonplace  actions expected and accepted as a matter of course. I have been on the scenes of massacres where the dead lay on the ground, in numbers, like the fallen leaves in a forest. They had been as helpless and as defenseless as sheep. They had not died as soldiers die in the heat of battle, fired with ardor and courage, with weapons in their hands, and exchanging blow for blow. They had died as the helpless must, with their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself."p. 133 (first paragraph)"In this movement we took with us three thousand Turkish soldiers who had been captured by the Russians and left on our hands when the Russians abandoned the struggle. During our retreat to Karaklis two thousand of these poor devils were cruelly put to death. I was sickened by the brutality displayed, but could not make any effective protest. Some, mercifully, were shot. Many of them were burned to death. The method employed was to put a quantity of straw into a hut, and then after crowding the hut with Turks, set fire to the straw."p. 19 (first paragraph)"The Tartar section of the town no longer existed, except as a pile of ruins. It had been destroyed and its inhabitants slaughtered. The same  fate befell the Tartar section of Khankandi."p. 22 (second paragraph)"Many of our men had served in the Russian Army, and were trained soldiers. We Armenians were rich and possessed arms. Tartars had never received military training. They were poor, and possessed few arms beyond knives. ...Shortly after the killing of the Tartars in our village, the revolution in Russia was suppressed."p. 97 (third paragraph)"Within a few years, following the beginning of the movement, an invisible government of Armenians by Armenians had been established in Turkish  Armenia in armed opposition to the Turkish Government. This secret  government had its own courts and laws and an army of assassins called 'Mauserists' (professional killers) to enforce its decrees."p. 98 (first paragraph)"The Dashnacks were in continual open rebellion against the Turkish  Government."p. 98 (third paragraph)"...the Dashnacks engineered a general revolt of Armenians in Turkish Armenia under the mistaken belief that European nations would intervene and secure independence for Turkish Armenia."p. 99 (second paragraph)"The Dashnacks were fanatics."           p. 99 (third paragraph)"The Dashnacks took advantage of this situation and extended their  revolutionary activities into the Russian province. They instituted  a campaign of terrorism and employed threats and force in securing contributions to the party funds from rich Armenians. A wealthy man would be assessed a stipulated sum. Refusal to pay brought upon him a sentence of death.  Every member of the party was pledged to carry out orders without  question. If a man were to be assassinated, lots might be drawn to select an executioner or the job might be assigned to one of the 'mauserists' of the party."p. 130 (first paragraph)"...in moments of victory against Turks and Kurds or Tartars, they  [Armenians] have been remorseless in seeking vengeance."p. 130 (third paragraph)"The city was a scene of confusion and terror. During the early days of  the war, when the Russian troops invaded Turkey, large numbers of the  Turkish population abandoned their homes and fled before the Russian  advance."p. 159 (second paragraph)"I made a cannon, a huge gun to lift which required four men. I made balls for it. With my cannon the Armenians could knock down any of the Tartar houses and so they were able to drive the Tartars out."p. 181 (first paragraph)"The Tartar villages were in ruins."p. 189 (third paragraph)"The dead Tartar lay with his head in a pool of mud and blood, his  beard still setaceous and now crimsoned."Need I go on?Serdar Argic                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

Lift the embargo against Bosnia, and let them defend themselves.What makes the UN troops more valuable than the Bosnian people?  Theyare letting the civilians die so the soldiers could survive, whenif anything, it should be the other way around.  Idiots like Owen expect Bosnians to swallow a forced plan, and just hope this problemwill go away.  Well they're wrong.  If they had got their butts in gear(that is, if Bosnia had oil) a year ago, much of this could be prevented.Now, however, the results of this tragedy will last for generations.That's like forcing the jews to make peace with Hitler.

Chaihorsky) wrote:[A] David --[A] We can go throwing flames at each other -[A] nothing is easier. Why do not you just try to[A] see the situation from a different prospective?Not taking sides leaves one in a state of perpetual indecision because both sides in this issue have their own logic at any given time. As an Armenian I am partisan -- by definition. However, this does give me the license to lie, cover-up, or revise events under question as we have read on UseNet in postings by agents of the Turkish government. I understand both sides of the issue, but this does not mean I will advocate both sides when it suits me. Such a position would make me a hypocrite. I am also not being paid by agents of Turkey nor Azerbaijan as are many proponents of the Azeri side. I refer to agents such as Captioline International Group, Ltd., being paid in excess of $30,000/month by Azerbaijan. I state my case unencumbered by such advocacy or prostitution. [A] You do not have to change your mind for that - [A] just (as if you are playing chess) ask yourself -[A] what if? [A] What if your tone is so offensive that one type of[A] people loose control and start to erratically insult[A] you, and others emotionally detach themselves from[A] you writings and are not engaging in the discussion [A] with you?My tone is not offensive. If people are offended by what I say than I justmay be too bad. This conflict, as is human conflict in general, is rather bleak and is surrounded by the most barbaric actions of man. Given such conditions, dispassion is rather difficult, and artificial at best. This does not mean that discussion is out of the question. No conflict is ever resolved without discussion.[A] I'll try first. Recently I received a message from[A] a Russian guy who frequently visited Baku that [A] approximately after 1986 the old situation when [A] there were no anti-Armenian press had changed and[A] the press became very anti-Armenian and average[A] Azeri became an Armenian-hater. This is devastation [A] news for me because one of my cornerstones was the fact[A] that I MYSELF SAW ARMENIANS IN BAKU AMONG OTHER ETHNIC[A] GROUPS AND SAW, OR HEARD, OR READ NOTHING THAT WOULD[A] SEEM LIKE HATRED. You might say that an outsider never [A] sees, but by that time I was myself victimized as a member[A] of a minority by Russians and knew what to look for and[A] what innocent sign or remark might signify.I am sure. The Soviet Union effectively froze in time all ethnic problems itcreated or was brewing just after WWI. During the Soviet reign, officials tended to shape the frozen conflicts in such a way so when thawed, they would serve the purposes of the internal policies of the Soviet Union orsuccessor states.[A] Again - one of my cornerstones show cracks. I will investigate.[A] Another cornerstone of my thought is that Armenia started[A] hostilities against Azeris in Armenia before anything happened[A] in Sumgait (not at all I am trying to justify violence in Sumgait[A] or anywhere else - I bow my head with grief and respect and [A] did demand and will laways demand that criminals be severely[A] punished according to the law of the land.[A] I would like you to supply me with the information about that.[A] Does or does not the hostilities began in Armenia? Was thousands[A] od Azeris thrown out of their homes and forced to leave Armeina[A] before Sumgait or not? Sumgait took place in February of 1988. The Azeris of Armenia were expelledin the late fall of 1988. It took the entire summer of 1988 for thesituation to get so bad for Azeris in Armenian that the Russians had toevacuate them. I refer specifically to _Human Rights Violations in Armeniaand Azerbaijan_, A report of Pax Christi Netherlands 12 September 1991. Also,one need only read the newspaper to verify this. You do realize, perhaps unknowingly -- perhaps not -- you are mirroring Turkish propaganda and lies regarding what took place when and where first![A] Second - in your last message you used a very terrifying[A] phrase - "Artificial borders" when you were talking about [A] Armenian. Do you believe that Armenia have righteous territorial[A] claims? Do you believe that Armenia has rights to the lands that[A] currently belong to other countries? [A] Do you believe that this is stricktly Armenian priviledge or[A] everybody should start reclaiming what once was theirs?I had addressed this issue several time before -- perhaps I was not clear. Thecurrent borders of Armenia were not set as a result of the consolidation ofa high Armenian culture. Today's Armenia is about 1/10 the land mass thatsustained Armenians for nearly three millennia. It was the natural Armenianboundaries that sustained Armenians -- not the current boundaries. The currentborders of Armenia would never support a society nor sustain its growth. Does this mean that Armenia should expand? It might, if Armenia is not allowed to integrate into the region. If this past winter is any indication of the future status of Armenia, then Armenia must do what it will to survive. Unfortunately, in my opinion, and you can quote me on this, as I am sure you and others will, the combined forces of both Armenia and Karabakh should have taken Karabakh and the land in between in a matter of weeks in late 1991. This would avoided all the pain and suffering both sides endured and would remove a tool of Russian influence in the Caucasus. You may call me a war-monger -- so be it. If Armenians don't defend their right to live on the land they live on, those rights will be taken away. The Azeris should not have the right to remove these Armenians, but given the first chance to, they will, as was proven throughout all of Azerbaijan. If the Soviet Union didn't break apart, today Karabakh would be emptied of Armenians. Operation Ring, started in early 1991 emptied the northern 1/3 of Karabakh of Armenians, but the operation was suspended by the disillusionment of the Soviet Union. Lucky for the Armenians! If the Azeris feel as though they can expel all the Armenians of Karabakh, the Armenians will resist, if the Armenians can't live under Azeri oppression, then they will fight for the right to live their lives free from such oppression. If this means these Armenian demand independence, I support such a move. If you can't understand this, as an Azeri, that is truly unfortunate. Until this is understood by the Gray Wolves in Baku, more young Azeri men will die in the pursuit of the expulsion and ethnic cleansing of Karabakh Armenians. [A] Third thing - you keep saying about 3000 years of Armenian presence[A] in Karabakh. What exactly you mean by that? That there were Armenians[A] 3000 years ago in Karabah? Only Armenians? Or among other nations?[A] I saw (SAW) a Russian tax map of Karabah with all the landowners and[A] occupant names on it (the map was surveyed by Russian Army in 1810.[A] Would you believe that there were almost exclusivly Achmeds and Hu-[A] sseins? I also saw Armenian names, but the absolute majority of the[A] population was Muslim. If I am wrong - give me your sources, but[A] please, let us keep the rule that we only pay attention to third[A] party sources.[A] There are Russian diplomatic documents about the mission of the[A] Russian famous writer and diplomat Griboedov whose mission in Iran[A] was protection of Armenians that were persecuted by Persians and[A] RELOCATION these Armenians inside Russian Empire. According to[A] the Russian tax documents that was the time when the population of[A] Karabakh became predominantly (in some places) Armenian.Karabakh, or Artsakh as it is known in Armenian (and Urartian) is the onlypiece of Armenia that has a continuous Armenian occupation, from thetransformation of the Urartians to Armenians, nearly 3,000 years ago. Yourefer to Russian and Muslim rulers over Karabakh, not the population! Yousurely must know the rules of Muslim landownership over non-Muslims.[A] You write in your letter that "Azeris were shelling Stepanakert which[A] now is almost completely destroyed"  David - is it fair to say that [A] Stepanakert was destroyed by Azeris? There is that fine line between[A] propaganda and personal view, however bizzarre that view is - YOU KNOW[A] AS WELL AS ANYBODY WHO SAW TV IN THE TIMES OF THE EARTHQUAKE - that [A] Stepanakert was almost completely devastated by the quake. [A] But may be you believe that the damage from Azeri shelling is greater[A] than the damage from the quake? OK, no problem, AS LONG AS YOU MENTION[A] THE QUAKE. As I wrote in a short response to you regarding this earlier. You may beconfusing Spitak with Stepanakert. There were no effects of the earthquake in Karabakh.[A] I want dialog. I am not interested in mud-throwing. And in dialog I want[A] honest opinions (one might be wrong, but one MUST be honest). Honest [A] opinions may be based on emotions but in this case one should indicate[A] that. But mostly we are looking for information based opinions.[A] I always ask myself - why I think that? Is it because I was told so[A] bt so many people that it became a truth? Or I read a book? Who wrote[A] it? What was his/her intentions/interests/whatever? Fine. I stated my opinions and the reasons for them. If you put into action what you just stated above, you would understand my outrage at the posting of Farid who just posted items from some Islamic conference, etc., and just left it at that. He has done his numerous times. At least I responded to that posting, and was outraged that Farid simply copies other people`s text, posts it -- yet does not display the courage be responsible for what he posts. One can always stand behind the facade of claiming what I write is polemic, however, as a result such irresponsibility I am free to make a claim of cowardice. [A] Please, give me sources, facts, titles of the books of third party[A] writers, etc.I believe I have, and can support what I claim. I don't make up history, nordo I have to! I have done enough research regarding Turkish Genocide Apology to revisionism from good scholarship, and I will never fall victim to bottomless pit of making claims without a solid basis.[A] And please, answer my questions in the beginning of the letter.[A] And for you Armenian friends who do not like what I write - [A] sorry, but these are my thoughts and it is very disturbing[A] that you like people when they say what you like and dislike[A] them when they say something that you do not like. Alex, I stated my friends and associates where rather surprised as the tone ofyour posting considering the fact that I had categorized you as an open-minded Azeri. Perhaps I was fooled by you? Perhaps I should believe that you are like "all Azeris when it comes to Armenians". I chose not to accept such a statement. They were not surprised at what you said so much as it was coming from you, somebody from which they expected otherwise. You see, you didn't add anything to the issue, which was the expectation, only conforming oldsuspicions.[A] For me[A] it is most inportant that a guy makes a honest effort to find[A] the truth. If so, he/she might have whatever opinion he/she[A] wants. I believe that telling people the truth, seeking it - is [A] far more noble than just support your race because it is yours.[A] That is a way of animals, primitive tribes and criminal societies.[A] Civilized people seek truth.[A] Cheers,[A] AlexIf you think I am intellectually dishonest, please demonstrate it. As I statedabove, I am partisan on this issue, thus expect me to take a stand in theinterest of the Armenians, not against Armenians. This stance should not seem strange to you. I am not here to generate excuses for Armenians wanting to live on the land they live on, and wanting to live in peace. If Armenians must die for what they believe in, and make ultimate sacrifice, you had better listen to them. No amount of rhetoric -- not from Yerevan, Baku, the CSCE, nor paid prostitutes in Washington -- will convince Karabakh Armenians otherwise! -- David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | "Armenia has not learned a lesson inS.D.P.A.

British promised to Venizelos(greek PM) that mainly greek populated areas of the Ottomans will begiven to Greece, _if_ he will agree to drag Greece in the side ofthe British during the WWI (because the greek King was proGerman).The British succeeded by bombarding Athens (1916), killing quite a few,forcing abdication of the King, division of Greece into two separatestates (North-South), and finally laying the ground for the most disasterousdivision between greeks for our century.(So don't feel bitter that the"Allies" gave any green light because they liked us....)Anyway, the British succeed to establish Venizelos, war starts at a secondfront against the Germans in the south while they were fighting the warin the East against the Russians, and finally the WWII came in an end.After that the British (and French) forgot immediately their promises(as usually). Even though publicly they say that they support the Greekcause, practically they not only do nothing, but instead, using some usual"reasoning" and other crap rhetoric as a pretext, they graduallybackup Kemal (who had given now to the British "water and bread" thathe will dissolve the superethnic Ottoman and contract it into a smallethnic-state). The main drive behind this British switch was the planto keep a Muslim state in the region as buffer against a Russian expansioninto warm-water facilities. The "greek empire" being an Orthodox Christianstate was too prone to become Russian client.Out of this intrigue, the current state of affairs was established on ourlands. While Venizelos and Kemal were promoted as true "Giants" by theBritish, since they worked to realize their goals in the region.Under the same plan, currently Greece and Turkey are recipients of bigmilitary funds from the US; both they are functioning as anti-Russianbuffers, while simultaneously both remain good clients of State Dept. becauseotherwise the use of terror of changing "the balance of power in the Aegean"will be used.Under the same exact rational you should see the Cyprus problem.GrPS: I don't make any anti-...whatever rhetoric. This is the situation    in our region and needs to be said. The previously mentioned powers    are not anything special; they are fucntioning the same way which    anyone else functions all throughout history. So I don't selectively    single them out; just they are relevant to _our_ current afairs.

 247From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>Subject: Labour's enclaves policy.IMPORTANTLabour's enclaves policy in the occupied territoriesby Israel Shahakpubl. in Middle East International, London, 30.4.93It is not difficult to discover Israel's policy towards the Palestinians at any given time. It can be easily inferred from the facts on the ground and from the information provided by the Hebrew press. There is one condition, though. The torrents of claptrap about "the peace process" must be totally ignored, as must Israel's official pronouncements, whole sole purpose is to distort reality. By concentrating only on the facts, it was early apparent that Labour's policies were no different from those of Shamir but for their greater reliance on deceit and their more effective implementation.Likud's policies were accurately described by Ariel Sharon in an article, accompanied by a map, in Yediot Aharonot last August. The Sharon plan envisaged a division of the West Bank into seven, and the Gaza Strip into four, "autonomous" Palestinian enclaves, all of them under Israeli supervision. The total area of these enclaves amounted to about 15 per cent of the territories. The rest was to be controlled by the Israeli settlements and the highways built around the enclaves. The entire area around Jerusalem, from the outskirts of Ramallah to the boundaries of Bethlehem, has already been turned into a "Greater Jerusalem" where the Arab-inhabited localities amount to small enclaves surrounded by areas occupied by Israeli settlements or reserved for them.Judging from Labour's settlement policy, it may be assumed that it may content itself with a lesser number of Arab enclaves of a rather larger size than Sharon had planned. But the principle of surrounding the enclaves by settlements strategically dispersed along the highways remains unchanged. Labour plans only four enclaves in the West Bank: two in "Samaria" and two in "Judea" (i.e. north and south of Jerusalem respectively), and no more than two in the Gaza Strip. In regard to "Greater Jerusalem", Labour's policies hardly deviate from Sharon's.A saner version of Likud policyAs some Israeli correspondents at once realised, Labour policies were but a saner version of Sharon's extravaganza. Last July, Gideon Eshet wrote in Yediot Aharonot that, while "barely a few months ago" Labour supported the demand to freeze all construction beyond the Green Line, "no specific decision to freeze construction in the territories has been taken". And Uzi Benziman wrote in Ha'aretz that "as far as can be judged on the basis of the internal political discussions in Jerusalem, Rabin intends to stick to Likud's ways".The two biggest enclaves envisaged by Labour are located in "Samaria". Therefore the belt of settlements around the "Trans-Samaria Highway", designed to separate those enclaves from each other, is of paramount importance. According to the latest data, the percentage of Israeli settlers in the entire West Bank population (apart from East Jerusalem) is a mere 5.5 per cent. But for the area around the "Trans-Samaria Highway", the corresponding figure is almost 20 per cent, and it is increasing steadily. The situation in the settlements of the "Efrat Block" south of Jerusalem, designed to sever the enclave around Bethlehem from the one around Hebron, is pretty much the same. The "Efrat Block" is now being connected with West Jerusalem by a highway.The project is costly in the extreme, because the highway is designed to bypass Bethlehem by a sequence of long tunnels. The final decision to build this highway was suspended until Rabin's return from his US visit in March. The subsequent decision to renew its construction can be seen as US approval for the enclaves plan as a whole.Process of impoverishmentThe enclaves plan implies deliberate and steady impoverishment of the Palestinians. This is well known in Israel but ignored abroad by all who should be concerned, including the PLO. In regard to the Gaza Strip, the whole process was best described by Ze'ev Shiff in Ha'aretz in March. He mentions having seen "a pamphlet issued six years ago by the Civil Administration forecasting the conditions in the Gaza Strip under Israeli rule in 2000". His analysis deserves to be quoted extensively:"We continue to steal the Strip's water, even though its quality deteriorates from year to year. We continue to steal the Strip's tiny land resources, in order to found there more and more settlements, as if we deliberately want to make the inhabitants despair, and in their despair think in termws of having nothing to lose. It is by our own doing that the Strip's workers must now spend travelling to their workplaces almost as much time as they spend working. From the military point of view, we have kept control of no more than half the Strip's area at an increasingly exorbitant price in manpower and resources. About a year before Moshe Arens left the defence ministry, I heard him saying that we should withdraw from the Strip come what may. His argument was that Israel sinks into the Strip ever deeper and deeper. He told me he had proposed this to Yitzhak Shamir but he rejected it." Yitzhak Rabin rejects it too.Enormous state support for the Qatif Block settlers can also be cited as proof that the enclaves plan is being implemented. The Qatif Block settlements, founded by the first Rabin government of 1974-77, are intended to divide the Gaza Strip into two separate enclaves. Efraim Davidi of Davar had data showing how vital for Israeli this enterprise is. "The Qatif Block is now producing 40 per cent of Israeli tomatoes destined for export, and a substantial proportion of cut flowers." He also deals with the subsidies the settlers receive, considerably augmented by the present government. Owing to them, housing units are cheap. The present government does not spare efforts to recruit new settlers to the block. "Any prospective settler will get a 95 per cent mortgage for his house on top of a grant of 18,000 shekels ($6,500)."Such data shows that Israel's plans apply whether the Palestinians of the Gaza Strip are allowed or forbidden to work in Israel. The economic motivations were explained by Danny Rubinstein in Ha'aretz in March:"From the economic viewpoint Gaza could already be sealed off hermetically and all the Strip's workers could be barred from entering Israel...Even though accurate data is hard to come by, it is indisputable that during the last two years the numbes of Gazan workers arriving daily to work in Israel has markedly decreased, from 80,000 in the mid'80s to 40,000 today. But the decrease is not only due to restrictions imposed on entering Israel from Gaza. It is also due to the drastic curtailment of demand for Gazan labour in Israel. With unemployment in Israel soaring and the construction of apartments blocks virtually halted, the workers from Gaza are no longer really needed..."Gaza's total dependenceThe entire economy of the Gaza Strip is totally dependent on Israel. In recent years in the Gaza Strip there has been an increase in sub-contracted work for Israeli factories, mostly footware and textiles. Thousands of small workshops, employing an average of four workers, get their raw materials or unfinished products, together with detailed working instructions, from Israeli factories. Rubinstein attributes this development to the fact that "the average wage in the Gaza Strip is merely 40 per cent of that in the West Bank, which in turn stands at half the average wage in Israel; and besides the Gazan employer does not pay any social security for his employees." If the average wage in the Gaza Strip is just a fifth of that in Israel, the profits of Israeli factories and even of Palestinian sub-contractors must be vast.They are higher still when "a Gazan sub-contractor provides labour to be performed at home, with the family's help. The livelihood of tens of thousands of Gazans depends on such sub-contracted work." Many of them are women and children, paid about ten shekels ($3.50) a day which can last 12 hours or more. There can be no doubt that profits from exploiting cheap Gazan labour are one of the reasons for the stubborn opposition of Rabin and other Israeli ministers to withdrawal from the Strip.Economic conditions in the Gaza Strip differ little from what was created straight after Israel's conquest [in 1967]. In this respect, one should not be deluded by the talk, nowadays fashionable, about Israeli gestures intended to "encourage economic development in the territories", As Israeli journalists point out, all permits for opening new businesses depend on a prior approval by the Shin Bet. "Behind all the professed goodwill there is no desire to solve problems, just the attitude of a good colonialist, willing to do something for the benefit of the natives, but on condition that they behave nicely, do not become rebellious, and never do anything against the interests of the metropolis, its economic interests included," wrote Michal Sela in Davar in February. The development of sub-contracted work in the Gaza Strip accords perfectly with Sela's diagnosis.Sela also shows how exactly the economic controls work. "In all branches of the economy, lobbies have been set in motion for purposes of freeing Israeli production from the threat of any Palestinian competition. The method is simplicity itself. As soon as any Israeli producer succeeds in persuading the government, or even the trade and industry minister alone, a military order is issued prohibiting the export of a given produce to Israel. If this does not suffice, a Palestinian factory may be denied a licence to operate or bureaucratic obstacles may paralyse its production." Among the most active of such lobbies is the agricultural one. It has succeeded in limiting exports of Gazan vegetables (except for those grown by settlers) not only to Israel but also to Europe, where they otherwise might compete with Israeli exports.Perpetuaring apartheidLabour's goal is to perpetuate this apartheid regime in the territories. The same goal is shared by the US, which otherwise could not support the Labour government so firmly. In my view one of the reasons the US feels happier about supporting Labour than Likud is its greater efficiency in pursuing the settlement drive. This point was brought home by Ofer Shelah in Ma'ariv, who deplored the settlers' failure which he attributed to Likud's inefficiency. he showed that the peak yearly settlement growth "occured during the term of office of the National Unity government (i.e. 1984-90) in which Rabin served throughout as the defence minister". Likud's reputation for settling the territories better than Labour is false, attributable to the many tiny settlements without strategic value founded under Shamir for symbolic reasons.To sum up: Labour's policy, unconditionally supported by the US differs from that of Likud primarily in the efficiency with which it is implemented. According to that policy the territories are to be divided into two parts. The major part is to be ruled by Israel directly, and the minor part indirectly. In my view, this racist scheme is doomed to ultimately fail, but at a horrifying price in human suffering. The sooner its true nature is recognised, the less suffering it may cause.************************************
