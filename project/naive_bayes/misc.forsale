It is a Ether+ SCSI interface.Apparently, it can be plugged into a SCSI port and from there to an ethernet.That way you save a slot. Nifty. Well, I assume you people know more about it,so, judging by the $350 price tag new, I'll ask, say, $75? Anybody interested?

I have been told thatthe built-in video should support at least 16bit and maybe 24bit color ona Macintosh Color Display.  However, the Monitors control panel stilllists 8bit (256 colors) as the highest possible.Does it make any difference which slots you put the SIMMs in?Do you have to do something to activate them?Do you have to do something to the Monitors control panel?BTW, I am running System 7.1 with 8 Megs of RAM.---Charles P.

The junk mail hasbeen much more interesting than the promised catalog.  If I'd knownwhat I was going to get, I wouldn't have hesitated.  I wouldn't besurprised if there were other folks who looked at the ad and said"nope" but who would be very interested in the junk mail that results.Similarly, there are people who wanted the advertised catalog whoaren't happy with the junk they got instead.The folks buying the mailing lists would prefer an honest ad, andso would the people reading it.-andy--

It prints with the        quality of a laser printer, but for a fraction of both        the inital cost and he long term cost (that is,        replacement of ink cartridges as opposed to replacement        of toner).  The printer prints at a maximum of 300*300        (D)ots (P)er (I)nch (D.P.I.) on many different types        and sizes of paper, including envelopes and        transperencies.  Printer prints in both landscape and        portrait modes.  Printer can accept up to two        cartridges giving it things like more memory or        additional fonts.  Printer works excellently with        Windows and DOS and brings TrueType to its full        potential.         I originally purchased the printer for $375.00.  Make me        an offer, but I would prefer to stay in the $300.00        range.  I will pay the shipping to anywhere in the         continental U.S.A.         If you are interested, please either leave me email or        call Kirk Peterson at (303) 494-7951 anytime.         Thanks!         P.S. The printer will work with any computer that             can accept a standard parallel or serial             connection.  (That is, IBM, Amiga, etc.)

Almost a half million new users joined the Internet last year,   many of them are commercial businesses. The ban on commercial   use of Internet is no more.Jack, there is a difference between using the network for commercialpurposes and advertising in newsgroups.  Business communication isokay.  Advertising to hundreds of thousands of users around the planetwho have no desire to receive advertising is not okay.   Those of us who pay for Internet access are constrained only   by our innate good taste and no have no "administrator" to    guide(?) us.I suspect that a site which generated a large volume of material notin anybody's good taste would find itself getting a lot of attentionit didn't want.  You may belong to the public library, but thatdoesn't mean you can deface the books, disorder the stacks, or disturbthe other patrons.You're constrained by the same rules that the rest of the users (manyacademic and military, who get irritable about a network for whichthey pay with tax and grant money carrying private businessadvertising) follow.  There are Secret Masters here, just likeeverywhere else.  They're not as obvious as the ones on Prodigy, butthey're here.No doubt at some point the Internet, like everything else, will becomegrotty enough to carry advertising.  At that time I hope it isconfined to its own newsgroups and not on discussion groups---likemisc.writing.Elizabeth Willey

I attemptedto cancel my order before I received the package, but I was too late andthe company refused to take the package back for refund. I know the truthwhich I would never get my $697 back, but I wish to get my money back asclose as possible. Here is the describtion of the package...Nishika 3D cameraIt takes very good picture, never been opendedor used. It came with wide angle flesh, carringcase, film, and a instruction video. It has fourlens and created a 3D effect on a regular 35mmfilm.JewelryIt came with the package as additional gift.Bahama vacation voucherThe voucher is good for two RT airfare to Freeport.The users get a special hotel rate of $27 per-personper-night. Meals, ground transfer, hotel tax is_not_ included.Las Vegas, Reno, OrlandoThe voucher provides one RT airfare, andhotel accomodation for 3 days/ 2 nights.Meals, ground transfer, hotel tax is notincluded. The voucher is good for all 3locations, but you can't travel to all 3places at once.Cancun, MexicoThe voucher provides one RT airfare, and hotelaccomodation for 3 days / 2 nights. Meals andground transfer, hotel tax is not included asusual.I paid $697 for the whole package. So try not to be cold-blooded when youmake your offer. Details would be provided by request. I do wish to sellthe whole package at once. So if you are just looking for the vacationvouchers, I don't care if you sell the camera to other for a higher pricIf you are interested in the camera, you could treat the vacation vouchersas gift.If you receive a letter in your mail box which says that you are selectedto be part of the sweeptake and you have at least one out of five awards. Trust me, you would get the exactly the same package as I did. There is only one award which will be given away. So don't bother even to call them back, if you are really interested, you could get it from me for a cheaper price. And you could receive the package within a week ( I waited three months to get my first and final packages). Also, they would ask for yourcredit card number and you have to pay for the interest to the credit card company. So why spend more than you should when you could get themfrom me for a cheaper price.If you are interested, please reply to me as soon as posible. I reallywish to get this over with. Make me an offer, if I am confortable withyour offer, I would send the package by U.P.S. the next day morning.More details could be given if you wish.Please contact me at koutd@hirama.hiram.eduDouglas KouHiram Collegee-mail address--- koutd@hirama.hiram.edu

It                  includes all the standard fun things about                  flight simulators, like taking off and landing                  on carriers, flying -- of course -- and better                  yet, it is also a battle simulator.  It is a                  lot of fun, indeed.                o An IBM PC or compatible with at least 640K, and                  dual floppies or a hard drive is required.                  o WinWay Resume for Windows                o Includes all original packaging, manuals                  and disks                o Original price: $50.00                o My asking price: $35.00                o WinWay Resume is a resume writing program for                  Windows.  It is an excellent program (it got                  me a job!) and running under the Window's                  interface makes it very, very easy to use.  All                  you do is answer a few questions, and print out                  the results.  In just a few minutes, you have a                  beautifully and professionally designed resume.                o An IBM PC with Windows 3.0 or later installed                  and 1 MB of free hard disk space is required.                  o More Typefaces                o Includes all original packaging, manuals                  and disks                o Original price: $99.99                o My asking price: $30.00                o More Typefaces is a package of three TypeType                  font families (for a total of twelve fonts) for                  Windows 3.1.

The SQ-80 is a powerful performanceoriented synth with a limited on-board sequencer.  I bought it becauseit has a very large timbral repertoire;  it seems to do meaty analogsynth sounds as well as sounds that are considerably more "digital".Below are a list of features extracted from the owner's manual:  o Eight-voice polyphonic poly-timbral synthesizer, capable of    playing eight different sounds at once, with dynamic stereo    panning for each voice  o Voice section employing Cross-Wave synthesis;  combine different    attack and sustain wave segments to create complex, dynamic sounds  o 75 sampled waves (includes a drumset) serve as the sound source  o Dynamic voice allocation:  each sequencer track/MIDI channel has    access to all eight voices  o A full-featured MIDI controller keyboard capable of sending eight    MIDI program and volume changes at once.  Keyboard is velocity    sensitive, and transmits/receives velocity and polyphonic aftertouch.  o Powerful matrix modulation scheme allows a very wide range of     modulation sources and routings.  o A 3.5" floppy disk drive which writes/reads ordinary DS/DD disks    allows fast and reliable storage of up to 600 sequences and up to    1728 sound patches on a single floppy disk.  Also has a RAM-cart slot    for patches that is compatible with ESQ-1 RAM-carts.  o Does sysex dumps to its floppy disk for any sysex capable MIDI device  o 80 character fluorescent display and user-friendly "page-driven"    programming scheme provides a fairly humane user interface  o Stereo line-outs, and stereo headphone jack for private listening  o Sound programs and sequences are upwardly compatible with the ESQ-1    so that sounds and sequences created for the ESQ-1 can be played on    the SQ-80.This SQ-80 has been the main MIDI controller in my studio for quite a whilenow.  It has performed ably in that role, and has also been a heavilyused sound source at the same time.  The SQ-80 seems to have been designedwith this role in mind, and it works very well with my software sequencer(WinCake) in its multitimbral mode.>From a synthesis point of view, this machine is a hybrid.  It uses loopedshort samples (there are 75 of them) as sources, then these wavesare processed with a sophisticated DCF-DCA arrangement.  The SQ-80is capable of great things because of its 4-pole analog lowpass filter.Simply put, it makes fabulous analog synth sounds.  But unlike mostgood analog synths, it has a very thorough MIDI implementation so that itworks very well with a MIDI sequencer.  What I really like most about thisthing is that it is capable of making a very wide range of sounds.This SQ-80 is about 5 years old (mfg. date 1/21/88).  It does havean 8-track sequencer, but like most on-board sequencers, it is a painto use so I have avoided it.REASON FOR SALE:I am selling my SQ-80 because I recently joined forces with another individualhere in Boston, and we have more keyboards than space to put them.  Irecommend it for someone who is getting started in sequencing and needs apowerful but economical master keyboard.PRICING AND TERMS:I paid $1300.00 for this synth a few years ago.  I am willing to accept$650.00 (average r.m.m.s asking price is $733.00).  I will include a bunch of patches on SQ-80 floppy disks for the buyer of this synth, as well as the original Ensoniq SQ-80 owner's manual.Price:    Asking $650.00 (everything)Shipping: split shipping (UPS Surface COD) anywhere in the lower 48 states-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Craig Vanderborgh                                         Verbex Voice Systemse-mail:  craigv@rad.verbex.com                            119 Russell Streetphone: (508) 486-8886                                     Littleton, MA 01460-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just to inform the readers of newsrc Sony has just introduced a new DATman,the TCD-D7 which is smaller and less expensive than the D3.  Also, the D7has a coaxial jack which the D3 lacks.  Oh, the D3 has always beenavailable through mail-order houses for less than $700 dollars new... withthe new model coming out, I suspect the now obsolete D3 will be selling for even less.   --   The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of the University of     North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the Campus Office for Information        Technology, or the Experimental Bulletin Board Service.           internet:  laUNChpad.unc.edu or 152.2.22.80

I attemptedto cancel my order before I received the package, but I was too late andthe company refused to take the package back for refund. I know the truthwhich I would never get my $697 back, but I wish to get my money back asclose as possible. Here is the describtion of the package...Nishika 3D cameraIt takes very good picture, never been opendedor used. It came with wide angle flesh, carringcase, film, and a instruction video. It has fourlens and created a 3D effect on a regular 35mmfilm.JewelryIt came with the package as additional gift.Bahama vacation voucherThe voucher is good for two RT airfare to Freeport.The users get a special hotel rate of $27 per-personper-night. Meals, ground transfer, hotel tax is_not_ included.Las Vegas, Reno, OrlandoThe voucher provides one RT airfare, andhotel accomodation for 3 days/ 2 nights.Meals, ground transfer, hotel tax is notincluded. The voucher is good for all 3locations, but you can't travel to all 3places at once.Cancun, MexicoThe voucher provides one RT airfare, and hotelaccomodation for 3 days / 2 nights. Meals andground transfer, hotel tax is not included asusual.I paid $697 for the whole package. So try not to be cold-blooded when youmake your offer. Details would be provided by request. I do wish to sellthe whole package at once. So if you are just looking for the vacationvouchers, I don't care if you sell the camera to other for a higher pricIf you are interested in the camera, you could treat the vacation vouchersas gift.If you receive a letter in your mail box which says that you are selectedto be part of the sweeptake and you have at least one out of five awards. Trust me, you would get the exactly the same package as I did. There is only one award which will be given away. So don't bother even to call them back, if you are really interested, you could get it from me for a cheaper price. And you could receive the package within a week ( I waited three months to get my first and final packages). Also, they would ask for yourcredit card number and you have to pay for the interest to the credit card company. So why spend more than you should when you could get themfrom me for a cheaper price.If you are interested, please reply to me as soon as posible. I reallywish to get this over with. Make me an offer, if I am confortable withyour offer, I would send the package by U.P.S. the next day morning.More details could be given if you wish.Please contact me at koutd@hirama.hiram.eduDouglas KouHiram Collegee-mail address--- koutd@hirama.hiram.edu

If you're at all interested in this merchandise, please e-mail me:djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu I'm compacting my system and moving to a single monitor system, so I havetwo monitors and cards for sale. Nothing at all is wrong with these pieces,I'm just wanting to conserve desk space, and get all of my info from onescreen. I'd prefer to sell to people near Austin and surrounding areas (withindriving distance - like an hour away perhaps), but I CAN ship to you if youdon't live near here. Only problem is that I didn't keep the original boxesfor the monitors, but I'm confident that my few months of full-time servicein the shipping room will enable me to safely package the monitors andflip it in your direction. Details: Mirror Full Page Display (monochrome) w/nubus card:---------------------------------------------------**SOLD** Sony 1304 14" color monitor:----------------------------What's to say? It got top ratings in last year's MacUser report. It's a SONY,Trinitron, arguably the best (but I'd rather not argue that point).It's a great monitor, in great shape, but I'm going to a bigger screen,and although I'd like to keep it, finances don't justify it. Still selling for $599 at MacLand (where I bought it originally - notincluding shipping), will sell for **$400** [was $475 orig. asking price](plus shipping). Again, make an offer if that sounds unreasonable.  RasterOps 24si (24-bit accelerated, hardware zoom/pan, 4 meg RAM):------------------------------------------------------------------Renamed the 24sx a few months after I bought it, this board is for 13"monitors, providing **accelerated 24-bit**, hardware zoom/pan, NTSC mode(you can plug it into something like the RasterOps Video Expander and outputNTSC), and 4 RAM slots that use 1 meg or 4 meg SIMMS for GWorld RAM, or aRAM disk. Software included for such functions. 4 meg of RAM included (1 megSIMMS). Selling for $605 at Bottom Line (without the RAM - add $100), I'm asking**$425** [was $525 orig. asking price](shipping included this time,it's just a card). Original box and packaging. I'd actually prefer to sellthe Sony monitor and this card together, so if you want both, drop me e-mailand make a "bundled offer" for these items. If you check the May 93 (or was it Feb 93) Macworld mag, you'll find that the24sx (or 24si - same thing) board did extremely well in the tests for 13-14"640 x 480 24-bit boards. Also supports up to 1120 (or so) x 512 in 24-bit, soyou can fit two pages width-wise via the scrolling desktop thang. It's a greatboard, but I'm going to a 19" monitor, and it can't help me there.------------ Cheers. -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Dan Keldsen            |  Are you now, or have you ever been:djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu |  a.

He was then suppose to send me the cpu.I receive his COD payment on 4/8/93.  He send me a message the he sent thecpu out 4/16/93.  It has been two weeks, and I didn't receive the CPU.I send him numerous message asking for confirmation that the cpu was ship, orwhat address he send it to (to make sure it didn't get lost in the mail.)He never reply my mail.  I finally resorted to calling him in Arizona.  The first call didn't getthrought, I got  an answering machine.  I left him my number.  He didn't reply.I call again the next day and he pick up the phone.  I asked him if he hadsend out the cpu.  He said yes, but he doesn't know what address he sent itto.  He said that you would check his record at home and call me back the next day.To my suprise, He never called.  I then send him some more email messages, henever reply again. (strang, when the deal was being made, he reply to everyof my message, now that He got my memory, He won't even reply to me.)Now:  I am still calling him, but he won't pick up the phone.  I am also still      emailing him, but he won't reply my mail.So if any one know this DANA WEICK, please contact him.he can be reach at:Dana Weick4238 W Las PalmaritasPhoenix, AZ 85051    (602)925-6123 in the day time this is his business number.

Be *very* careful when you install it, be careful of static discharge,bending pins during insertion and above all make absolutely certain youplug the chip in the proper orientation.  The chip was checked out prior toshipping and if you cook it by plugging it in backwards I won't be realsympathetic!  If you don't know how to tell what orientation the chip should be installed, DON'T GUESS!********************************DANA WEICK UPDATE:****************************I call him sunday, his wife Debbie picked up the phone.  She said that he was busy with his kids, and he would call me back in 10 minuets.  Half an housewent by, Weick didn't called.  I called him again, and his phone was discon-nected.Since this post,  I have numberous people who mail me saying that this DANAWEICK have ripped them off.  We got do something about this guy.  He hasappearrently been doing this for a few years now.  And he is getting awaywith it.--   Minh Pham      E-mail: minh@wpi.wpi.edu             Worcester Polytechnical Institute

All bar one of these are operational - that one failedand has never been repaired because it was no longer needed.The 7A22 has an on-board voltage offset as well as switchable high-and low- pass filters. There is _nothing_ on the market, to myknowledge, that comes close to the specs of this plug-in.All of the above have service manuals.

These are great amps, and I've never    had a minute's trouble with either of them.  I've been running them on    high end for quite some time (front/rear) and have been very pleased    with them in that setup, but I've also run them on low end before, and    they perform quite well in that situation as well.  I'm trying to sell    them because I'm considering upgrading to a Rockford 650.  I already    own a Power 300, and I've always liked the way the 650/300 combo worked    in cars.    I'm asking $200.00 a piece, and list on them when I bought them was    $375.00.  If you're interested in both of them, I'd be willing to come    down on the price a little bit.(1) Precision Power 2150.  This great utility amplifier is rated at 2x150,    and looks brand new.  The shroud is unscratched, and it works great.    This is a great low-end amp because of it's high-power rating into    2 channels, however, I've also had it running front or back high end    before where it did very well.    I'm asking $425.00 for this amp, but feel free to make me an offer on    it.**** Please direct questions/replies to hacker@krusty.gtri.gatech.edu ****================================================================================ Chase Hacker                          "Fortune presents gifts not        ==== chase@cc.gatech.edu                    according to the book.

I'm sorry if anyone thinks that I am wastingspace, but I thought you might want some relief from the "So-and-so is a thief"posts.  Not that I think we shouldn't hear about the bad deals, but it would benice to hear some good news once in a while.After seeing his post on one of the for sale groups, I mailed Mr. Mark Miller arequest for his copy of WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS.  He suggested a price of $50in his ad, but when I phoned him, he quoted $40 plus shipping.  That soundedmore than fair to me, so I told him that I would send him a check the next day. Imagine my surprise when I logged into my account the following day and found amessage from him saying that it had already been sold (after I had just mailedthe money order).  After another E-Mail message to him, he apologized andassured me that it was a mistake - I was the one who he was holding it for.  Hesent the package as soon as he got the money, along with a letter stating atransfer of license.  This wasn't good enough for WordPerfect, so I asked himto fill out one of their forms.  No problem - we thought.  It took three timesto get it to the right address (my fault).  Anyway, he mailed me the form formy signature and included a Workbook that I had no idea was included in thedeal.  Again, he apologized for not sending it before.  I now have the world'sbest word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few goodones left.  I recoend that if you ever see that Mark is selling anything thatatyou may want, give him a call.  If I had the choice, I would purchase all of mysoftware from him.Bravo, Mr. Miller!- Kevin Harter

The scumster - R.E.P. - called my friend andthey agreed on a price. My friend (unexperienced and not too fluent inEnglish) paid by check, requesting R.E.P. to call him back when the checkarrives and the HD is send. Well, the check was cashed 3/24 and that isthat. Phone # that R.E.P. gave is on the answering machine all the timeand there is no reaction when the message is left; e-mail address does notbounce but again there is no answer. I know, that R.E.P. is a student atUniversity of Delaware; I have his e-mail address, his US postal addressand his (?) phone#. The question is: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO PROCEED?Thanks in advance for any advice.Sincerely,Victor Levenson (VVL2H@virginia.edu)P.S. The reason I did not put R.E.P.'s full name is that I still hope...P.P.S.

I would sell it for $500 for the whole package. Details could be provided by request. I do wish to sell the whole package at once. So if you are just looking for the vacation vouchers, I don't care if you sell the camera to other for a higher price. If you are interested in the camera, you could treat the vacation vouchers as gift.Some of you might receive a letter in your mail box which says that you are selected to be part of the sweeptake and you have at least one out of five awards. Trust me, you would get the exactly the same package as I did. There is only one award which will be given away. So don't bother even to call them back, if you are really interested, you could get it from me for a cheaper price. And you could receive the package within a week ( I waited three months to get my first and final packages). Also, they would ask for your credit card number and you have to pay for the interest to the credit card company. So why spend more than youshould when you could get them from me for a cheaper price.If you are interested, please reply to me as soon as posible. I reallywish to get this over with.

If you're at all interested in this merchandise, please e-mail me:djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu I'm compacting my system and moving to a single monitor system, so I havetwo monitors and cards for sale. Nothing at all is wrong with these pieces,I'm just wanting to conserve desk space, and get all of my info from onescreen. I'd prefer to sell to people near Austin and surrounding areas (withindriving distance - like an hour away perhaps), but I CAN ship to you if youdon't live near here. Only problem is that I didn't keep the original boxesfor the monitors, but I'm confident that my few months of full-time servicein the shipping room will enable me to safely package the monitors andflip it in your direction. Details: Mirror Full Page Display (monochrome) w/nubus card:--------------------------------------------------- **SOLD** Sony 1304 14" color monitor:----------------------------What's to say? It got top ratings in last year's MacUser report. It's a SONY,Trinitron, arguably the best (but I'd rather not argue that point).It's a great monitor, in great shape, but I'm going to a bigger screen,and although I'd like to keep it, finances don't justify it. Still selling for $599 at MacLand (where I bought it originally - notincluding shipping), will sell for **$475** (plus shipping). Again, make anoffer if that sounds unreasonable.  RasterOps 24si (24-bit accelerated, hardware zoom/pan, 4 meg RAM):------------------------------------------------------------------Renamed the 24sx a few months after I bought it, this board is for 13"monitors, providing **accelerated 24-bit**, hardware zoom/pan, NTSC mode(you can plug it into something like the RasterOps Video Expander and outputNTSC), and 4 RAM slots that use 1 meg or 4 meg SIMMS for GWorld RAM, or aRAM disk. Software included for such functions. 4 meg of RAM included (1 megSIMMS). Selling for $605 at Bottom Line (without the RAM - add $100), I'm asking**$525** (shipping included this time, it's just a card). Original box andpackaging. I'd actually prefer to sell the Sony monitor and this cardtogether, so if you want both, drop me e-mail and make a "bundled offer"for these items. ------------ Cheers. dan keldsen - djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Dan Keldsen            |  Are you now, or have you ever been:djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu |  a.

The seller insistedthat it was 'in good condition' when he sent it and so would just return half ofthe amount that I paid if I send the item back to him and after he is sured itis bad. Is this reasonable?Basically I would like to believe the seller tells the truth. Also, I am positively to say that I've not done anything wrong which might cause the failure of the thing. My assumption here is everyone is honest - so rule out the possibility that either one of the two parties or both are liars.I would like to hear your opinion - either in here or directly respond to mye-mail address.I know there is such a risk that you could lose money. But, how can we make itenjoyable to most people and not wasting the bandwidth?chein

The question is how much that qualityis worth to a ham in amateur service, not commercial service>This radio can hear a repeater thats 40 miles away without> an antenna.Ok, great. But how often does that come up?  How good is"good enough", and how much is someone willing to pay for it?A good ham-quality HT is maybe $500, while a commercialquality one is maybe $2000. Is the increased reliability andperformance worth 4 times the price *in amateur service*?Only the individual involved can answer that question, and eachham has to decide for him/herself.  If Motorola quality is worth4 times the price to you, then more power to ya'. But I'm amazedthat folks make that choice. For, me, given that I've got $2000 tospend, I'l pick the Yaesu ht and a nice new HF rig every time overa Motorola ht alone, no matter how good it is.  To me, ham-qualitygear is "good enough". To each his own...73... Mike, N4PDY******************************* These are my opinions only.*******************************

A description follows:Okidata 180 printer including cables for both IBM compatibles (Centronicsparallel) and Commodore (RS-232 - round).  Also includes power cable, manual,and a handful of computer paper to get you started.  This is a 9-pin printer. I recently cleaned the printhead and installed a new ribbon.  A print sample can be provided upon request.  This is a very dependable printer - it neverjams or does "weird" things.  I have used it with a Commodore for about 3 yearsand am now using it with my 486sx.  I use mainly WordPerfect 5.1 (see nextpost) for which I got a driver (at no charge) that directly supports the Okidata 180 in Epson FX mode. When I got the printer, it was selling for around $200-220 new (I got minefrom Tenex brand new - for a Christmas present).  I would like to get about$100 or so for it.  If you are interested at all in it, please give me a ring(E-Mail) and make an offer.- Kevin Harter

However, it's still a heck of a machine for the price -- itis quite rugged, and many people out there swear by it.  (It's probably themost popular walkman-style DAT machine out there.)        Anyway, the guy selling it is Bryan Davis (bdavis@netcom.com), andhere's what he told me:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Here is what is included:        - TCD-D3 DATman.        - (2) RCA to Stereo 1/8" plug cables.  One for analog input, one for          analog output.        - Optical digital I/O cable (one lead for input, one for output).        - A copy of my sales receipt with a note about your purchase.  The          unit is still under factory warrantee.        - AC adaptor/battery charger.        - Rechargable battery.I paid $750 + tax for it so I hope you don't mind if I keep the 60 minutetape it came with (I have some samples on it!).[By the way, he spent at least $100 too much for it, unless he's including an extended warranty, which is advised for DAT machines, since it costs about $300 to replace the head when it wears out, and it probably will within 5 years if you use it a lot.. -- davisonj]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------        I'm not going to quote my sale price for him: that would not be nice.Send him mail and ask him what he wants.        Again, I've used the TCD-D3, and I have to say that I can certainlyunderstand why it is as popular as it is.  I've been using one for a littlewhile, and although I had some problems with it recently, I should also pointout that the particular one I was using had been on the road for two years andhad truly been _used_ during that time.  (This is the same exact DAT machinethat was lugged around the U.S. and Canada to record the Jazz ButcherConspiracy for their recent live album.)        Bryan Davis says:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------I know at least half a dozen professional musicians and record labelsin S.F who use that model (and have been for a while) with no reportedproblem.  My problem is that everyone I know already has one.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------        'nuff said.        The reason I'm not getting it is that I found someone else selling me aunit that features phono-plug SPDIF I/O instead of optical (I don't have anyoptical ports on my equipment, but you, the reader, might), and it also hassome other bells & whistles that the TCD-D3 doesn't.  (I am also paying morefor the alternative.)  Note that phono-plug-to-optical SPDIF adapters areavailable if you absolutely must have one.        Of course, it has SCMS.  All consumer decks do.  (So do Sony Minidiscs,by the way.)        Anyway, if you're interested, get in touch with bdavis@netcom.com.-- John Davisondavisonj@ecn.purdue.edu

The second part is   posted to comp.sys.mac.system and features many questions about  system  software.  The third part is posted every two weeks in  comp.sys.mac.misc.  Tables of contents for those two pieces are  included above. Please familiarize  yourself with all three  sections of this document  before posting.            All pieces  are available for anonymous ftp from  rtfm.mit.edu (18.172.1.27) in the directory   pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh.  Except for this introductory  FAQ which appears in multiple newsgroups and is stored as  general-faq.Z, the name of each file has the format of the last  part of the group name followed by "-faq.Z", e.g the FAQ for  comp.sys.mac.system is stored as system-faq.Z and the FAQ for  comp.sys.mac.misc is stored as misc-faq.Z.  RTFM stores files as   compressed (.Z) BINARY files.  If you leave off the .Z at the end  of  the file name when "getting" the file, rtfm will automatically   decompress the file before sending it to you.  You can also have   these files mailed to you by sending an E-mail message to   mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the line:  send  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh/"name"  in the body text where  "name" is the name of the file you want as  specified above (e.g.  general-faq).  You can also send this server a message with the  subject "help" for more detailed instructions.        ====================  I HAVE A QUESTION...  (1.0) ====================         Congratulations!  You've come to the right place.  Usenet is   a wonderful resource for information ranging from basic questions  (How do I lock a floppy disk?) to queries that would make Steve  Jobs himself run screaming from the room in terror.  (I used  ResEdit to remove resources Init #11, WDEF 34, and nVIR 17 from my  system file and used the Hex Editor to add code string #A67B45 as a  patch to the SFGetFile routine so the Standard File Dialog Box  would be a nice shade of mauve.  Everything worked fine until I  installed SuperCDevBlaster, and now when I use the Aldus driver to  print from PageMaker 5.0d4 to a Linotronic 6000 my system hangs.   P.S.  I'm running System 6.0.2 on a PowerBook 170.)          Since the Macintosh newsgroups are medium to high volume, we  ask that you first peruse this FAQ list including at least the  table of contents for the other pieces of it, check any other  relevant on-line resources listed below in question 1.2, especially  the FAQ lists for the other Macintosh newsgroups, and RTFM (Read  the Friendly Manual) before posting your question.  We realize that  you are personally incensed that the System is taking up fourteen  of your newly-installed twenty megs of RAM, but this question has  already made its way around the world three hundred times before,  and it's developing tired feet.  Finally, before posting to any  newsgroup (Macintosh or otherwise), please familiarize yourself  with the basic etiquette of Usenet as described in the newsgroup  news.announce.newusers. HOW DO I USE THIS DOCUMENT?  WHERE CAN I GET IT?  (1.1)               comp.sys.mac.faq is currently divided into multiple pieces,  a general introduction which you're reading now, and specific lists  for the newsgroups comp.sys.mac.system and comp.sys.mac.misc.  FAQ  lists for comp.sys.mac.wanted, comp.sys.mac.apps and  comp.sys.mac.hardware are in development.  When ready each part  will be available in its respective newsgroup.  All pieces are  available via anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu in the  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh directory. Except for this  document itself which is named general-faq.Z the pieces are named  as per the last part of the newsgroup they cover  followed by  "-faq", e.g. system-faq.Z, misc-faq.Z.  The .Z means the  file is  stored compressed so you'll need to ftp it in binary mode and use  either MacCompress, StuffIt Deluxe, or the UNIX uncompress command   to decompress it.  However if you leave off the ".Z" extension when   you "get" the file, rtfm will automatically decompress the file  before sending it to you.            This introductory document is posted to all of the concerned  newsgroups.  The tables of contents for each of the specific FAQ  lists are at the beginning of this file so you should be able to  get  at least some idea whether your question is answered anywhere  else in the FAQ even if you don't have the other parts at hand.   It's not always obvious, especially to newcomers, where a  particular question or comment should be posted.  Please  familiarize yourself with the FAQ lists in all the major Macintosh  newsgroups before posting in any of them.  Which questions appear  in which FAQs can serve as a basic guide to what posts belong  where.            To jump to a particular question search for  section-number.question-number enclosed in parentheses.  For  example to find "Where can I FTP Macintosh software?" search for  the string  "(2.1)".  To jump to a section instead of a question  use a zero for  the question number. WHAT OTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE?  (1.2)      comp.sys.mac.faq provides short answers to a number of   frequently asked questions appropriate for the Usenet newsgroup  comp.sys.mac.misc and comp.sys.mac.system.  Four other files are  worthy of particular note: Daryl Spitzer maintains a FAQ list  covering Macintosh programming for the newsgroup  comp.sys.mac.programmer.  It's posted to that group weekly and   available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.uoregon (128.223.8.8) in   /pub/mac.  Eric Rosen maintains a frequently asked questions list   for comp.sys.mac.comm available in that newsgroup and from  rascal.ics.utexas.edu in mac/faq (where the file you're reading now  is also irregularly archived).  This list answers many frequently  asked questions about networking, UNIX and the Mac,  telecommunications, and foreign file formats.  Norm Walsh has  compiled an excellent FAQ for comp.fonts that answers a lot of  questions about the various kinds of fonts and cross-platform  conversion and printing.  It's available in comp.fonts or by ftp  from ibis.cs.umass.edu in /pub/norm/comp.fonts/FAQ*.  Finally Jim  Jagielski maintains a FAQ for comp.unix.aux covering Apple's UNIX  environment, A/UX.  It's posted every 2 to 3 weeks in comp.unix.aux  and news.answers. It's available for anonymous ftp at  jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov. WHICH NEWSGROUP SHOULD I POST TO?  (1.3)        There are no stupid questions, but there are misplaced ones.   You wouldn't ask your English teacher how to do the definite  integral  of ln x between zero and one, would you?  So don't ask  the programmer newsgroup why your system is so slow when Microsoft  Word is in the background.  Ignorance of basic netiquette is not an  excuse. If you want people to help you, you need to learn their  ways of  communicating.          Posting questions to the proper newsgroup will fill your  mailbox with pearls of wisdom (and maybe a few rotten oysters too  :-) ).  Posting to the wrong newsgroup often engenders a thundering  silence.  For instance the most common and glaring mispost, one  that seems as incongruous to dwellers in the Macintosh regions of  Usenet as would a purple elephant to Aleuts in the Arctic, asking a  question about networking anywhere except comp.sys.mac.comm,  normally produces no useful responses.  Posting the same question  to comp.sys.mac.comm ensures that your post is read and considered  by dozens of experienced network administrators and not a few  network software designers.           Please post to exactly ONE newsgroup.  Do not cross-post.   If a question isn't important enough for you to take the extra  minute to figure out where it properly belongs, it's not important  enough for several thousand people to spend their time reading.   For the same reason comp.sys.mac.misc should not be used as a  catch-all newsgroup.           The breakdown of questions between different newsgroups in  this document can also serve as a reasonable guide to what belongs  where.  Specifically questions about productivity applications  (software you bought your Macintosh to run, not software you bought  to make your Macintosh run better) should go to comp.sys.mac.apps  unless the application is covered in a more specific newsgroup.   Communications programs, games, HyperCard, compilers and databases  all have more topical comp.sys.mac.* newsgroups.  Post questions  about non-communications hardware including questions about what  software is necessary to make particular hardware work to  comp.sys.mac.hardware.  Questions about MacOS system software  belong in comp.sys.mac.system.  Questions about utilities and  extensions normally belong in comp.sys.mac.misc.  Questions about  A/UX go to comp.unix.aux.  Detailed questions about Appletalk  belong in comp.protocols.appletalk.           Direct questions about HyperCard to comp.sys.mac.hypercard.   Non-HyperCard programming questions and questions about development  environments should go to comp.sys.mac.programmer.  ResEdit  questions may be posted either to comp.sys.mac.misc,  comp.sys.mac.system, or comp.sys.mac.programmer; but generally the  netters who inhabit the darker recesses of comp.sys.mac.programmer  are considerably more practiced at the art of resource hacking.            A general exception to the above rules is that any VERY  technical question about an application that actually begins to  delve into the how's of a program as well as the what's (Recent  example: How does WriteNow which is written entirely in assembly  compare to other word processors written in high level languages?)  might be better addressed to the programmer newsgroup.             For Sale and Want to Buy posts should go to  comp.sys.mac.wanted and misc.forsale.computers.mac ONLY.  We  understand that you're desperate to sell your upgraded 128K Mac to  get the $$ for a PowerBook 180; but trust me, anyone who wants to  buy it will be reading comp.sys.mac.wanted.  Political and  religious questions (The Mac is better than Windows! Is not! Is  too! Is not! Is too! Hey! How 'bout the Amiga! What about it? Is  Not! Is too!) belong in comp.sys.mac.advocacy.  Anything not  specifically mentioned above probably belongs in comp.sys.mac.misc.           Finally don't be so provincial as to consider only the  comp.sys.mac newsgroups the appropriate forums for your questions.   Many questions about modems in comp.sys.mac.comm are much more  thoroughly discussed in comp.dcom.modems.  Questions about Mac MIDI  are often better handled in comp.music even though it's not a  Macintosh specific newsgroup.  Shop around.  Usenet's a big place  and not everything relevant to the Macintosh happens in  comp.sys.mac. 4. SOMEONE JUST ASKED WHY THE SYSTEM WAS TAKING UP SIXTEEN OF THEIR  TWENTY MEGABYTES OF RAM.  SHOULDN'T I PUT MY BRILLIANCE AND WIT ON  DISPLAY FOR THE WORLD BY POSTING THE SEVENTEENTH RESPONSE?      No.  Frequent answers are just as boring and uninteresting as  frequent questions.  Unless you really have something new to add to  the traditional answers (such as the recent discovery that fonts in  System 7.1 could eat memory) private E-mail is a much better medium  for answering common questions like this one.            You might want to add a mention of this FAQ in your E-mail  response and a polite suggestion that your correspondent read it  before posting future questions.  I do read all the newsgroups  covered here and have written a small script in MicroPhone II that  lets me send PWFAQ's (people with frequently asked questions) the  section of this document that answers their question with just the  click of a button so please don't feel obligated to respond to  someone who cares so little about the answer to their question they  can't be troubled to read the FAQ list to get it.     ===  FTP  (2.0)  === WHERE CAN I FTP MAC SOFTWARE?  (2.1)      The three major North American Internet archives of shareware,  freeware, and demo software are sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6),  mac.archive.umich.edu (141.211.165.41), and wuarchive.wustl.edu  (128.252.135.4) which mirrors the other two sites and several  others. Wuarchive often holds on to files after other sites remove  them for space concerns, and still has files that were deleted from  the formerly important site, rascal.ics.utexas.edu.  Rascal was  notable for storing its files in MacBinary format rather than the  less efficient BinHex format common at the other archives.  Unless  otherwise noted shareware and freeware mentioned in this document  should be available at the above sites.         To keep traffic on the Internet manageable, Scandinavians   should try connecting to ftp.funet.fi (128.214.6.100), ftp.lth.se  (130.235.20.3), or sics.se (192.16.123.90) instead.  Those in   the U.K. should look first at src.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.2.1).   Continental Europeans can try nic.switch.ch (130.59.1.40),    ezinfo.ethz.ch (129.132.2.72), and anl.anl.fr(192.54.179.1).   Australian users should try to find what they want at archie.au  (139.130.4.6) which mirrors info-mac and mac.archive.  Japanese  users will find sumex mirrored at ftp.u-tokyo.ac.jp  (130.69.254.254).          A fourth very important site is ftp.apple.com (130.43.2.3).   This is Apple's semi-official repository for system software,  developer tools, source code, technical notes, and other things  that come more or less straight from Apple's mouth.  Some material  at this site may not be distributed outside the U.S. or by other  sites that don't have an official license to distribute Apple  system software.  Please read the various README documents  available at ftp.apple.com for the detailed info if you're  connecting from outside the U.S. or if you wish to redistribute  material you find here. CAN I GET SHAREWARE BY E-MAIL?  (2.2)      The info-mac archives at sumex-aim are available by E-mail from  LISTSERV@RICEVM1.bitnet (alternately listserv@ricevm1.rice.edu).   The listserver responds to the commands $MACARCH HELP, $MACARCH  INDEX, and $MACARCH GET filename.  Mac archive files are available  from mac@mac.archive.umich.edu.  Send it a message containing the  words "help" and "index" (no quotes) on the first two lines of your  message for instructions on getting started and a list of the files  you may request.  You can retrieve files from other sites by using  the server at ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com.  For details send it a  message with just the text "help" (no quotes). WHERE CAN I FIND APPLICATION X?  (2.3)      If you can't find what you're looking for at one of the above  sites, try telnetting to your nearest archie server or sending it  an E-mail message addressed to archie with the subject "help."   Archie servers are located at archie.rutgers.edu (128.6.18.15,  America), archie.mcgill.ca (132.206.2.3, the original archie server  in Canada), archie.au (139.130.4.6, Australia), archie.funet.fi  (128.214.6.100, Scandinavia), and archie.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.3.7,  the U.K. and the continent).  These sites index the tens of  thousands of files available for anonymous ftp.  Login as "archie"  (no password is needed) and type "prog filename" to find what  you're looking for or type "help" for more detailed instructions.   For instance you would type "prog Disinfectant" to search for a  convenient ftp site for Disinfectant.  If the initial search fails  to turn up the file you want, try variations on and substrings of  the name.  For instance if you didn't find Disinfectant with "prog  Disinfectant", you might try "prog disi" instead.  Substring  searches often hide the gold in a pile of dross.  To avoid many  erroneous matches add a ".*\\.hqx" to the end of the substring, e.g.  "prog disi.*\\.hqx"  Most Mac software available on the net ends in  .hqx but almost no UNIX or PC software does.          Please check the above archives and ARCHIE personally BEFORE  asking where you can find a particular piece of shareware.  If you  follow the above advice, you should almost never have to ask the  net where to find a particular piece of software. CAN SOMEONE MAIL ME APPLICATION X?  (2.4)      No.  Nor will anyone mail you a part of a file from  comp.binaries.mac that was corrupt or missed at your site.  Please  refer to the first questions in this section to find out about  anonymous FTP, archie, and automatic E-mail servers. WHAT IS .BIN? .HQX? .CPT? .ETC?  (2.5)      Most files available by FTP are modified twice to allow them to  more easily pass through foreign computer systems.  First they're  compressed to make them faster to download, and then they're  translated to either a binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary (.bin) format  that other computers can digest.  (The Macintosh uses a special  two-fork filing system that chokes most other computers.)  BinHex  files are 7-bit ASCII text files, while MacBinary files are pure  8-bit binary data that must always be transferred using a binary  protocol.           How a file has been translated and compressed for  transmission is indicated by its suffix.  Normally a file will have  a name something like filename.xxx.yyy.  .xxx indicates how it was  compressed and .yyy indicates how it was translated.  To use a file  you've FTP'd and downloaded to your Mac you'll need to reverse the  process.  Most files you get from the net require a two-step  decoding process.  First change the binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary  (.bin) file to a double-clickable Macintosh file; then decompress  it.  Which programs decode which file types is covered in the table  below.  Also note that most Macintosh telecommunications programs  will  automatically convert MacBinary files to regular Macintosh  files as they are downloaded.***************************************************************************Suffix:      .sit  .cpt  .hqx  .bin  .pit  .Z  .image  .dd  .zip .uu  .tar Extractors--------------------------------------------------------------------------StuffIt 3.0|   X     X     X     X     X                  Compact Pro|         X     X Packit     |                           XUUTool     |                                                      X MacCompress|                                X SunTar     |               X     X     X                                X BinHex 5.0 |                     X BinHex 4.0 |               X DiskDoubler|                           X                X UnZip      |                                                   X DiskCopy   |                                     X macutil    |         X     X           X                X***************************************************************************     A few notes on the decompressors:      StuffIt is a family of products that use several different  compression schemes.  The freeware StuffIt Expander will unstuff  all of them.  Versions of StuffIt earlier than 3.0 (StuffIt 1.5.1,  StuffIt Classic, UnStuffIt, and StuffIt Deluxe 2.0 and 1.0) will  not unstuff the increasing number of files stuffed by StuffIt 3.0.   You need to get a more recent version of StuffIt or StuffIt  Expander.              StuffIt 3.0.5 (Lite and Deluxe) consistently makes smaller  archives than any other Macintosh compression utility.  To allow  maximum space for files on the various ftp sites and to keep  net-bandwidth down, please compress all files you send to anonymous  ftp sites with StuffIt 3.0.5.            UUTool, MacCompress, and SunTar handle the popular UNIX  formats of  uuencode (.uu), compress (.Z), and tar (.tar)  respectively.  The UNIX versions are often more robust than the Mac  products, so use them instead when that's an  option.  Translators  that allow StuffIt Lite to expand uuencoded and tar files are also  available by anonymous ftp.            Macutil is dik winter's package of UNIX utilities to  decompress and debinhex files on a workstation before downloading  them to a Mac. Since UNIX stores files differently than does the  Mac, macutil creates MacBinary (.bin) files which should be  automatically converted on download.  It can't decompress  everything. In particular it can't decompress the new StuffIt 3.0  archives. :-(  However, if you need only one or two files out of an  archive--for instance if you want to read the README to find out if  a program does what you need it to do before you download all of  it--macutil is indispensable.  It can be found at sumex-aim in the  info-mac/unix directory.     A few notes on the compression formats:      .bin:  These are MacBinary files.  Always use a binary file  transfer protocol when transferring them, never ASCII or text.   Most files on the net are stored as .hqx instead.  Only rascal  stores most of its files in .bin format.  Most communications  programs such as ZTerm and MacKermit are capable of translating  MacBinary files on the fly as they download if they know in advance  they'll be downloading MacBinary files.        .image: This format is normally used only for system software,  so that on-line users can download files that can easily be  converted into exact copies of the installer floppies.  Instead of  using DiskCopy to restore the images to floppies, you can use Steve  Christensen's freeware utility  MountImage to treat the images on  your hard disk as actual floppies inserted in a floppy drive.   MountImage has a reputation for being buggy, so you should have  some blank floppies and a copy of DiskCopy handy just in case.        .sea (.x, .X):  .sea files don't merit a position in the above  table because they're self-extracting.  They may have been created  with Compact Pro, StuffIt, or even DiskDoubler; but all should be  capable of decompressing themselves when double-clicked.  For some  unknown reason Alysis has chosen not to use this industry standard  designation for self-extracting archives created with their   payware products SuperDisk! and More Disk Space.  Instead they   append either .x or .X to self-extracting archives. HOW CAN I GET BINHEX?  STUFFIT?  ETC.?  (2.6)      By far the easiest way to get these programs is to ask a human  being to copy them onto a floppy for you.  If you're at a  university there's absolutely no excuse for not finding someone to  give you a copy; and if you're anywhere less remote than McMurdo  Sound, chances are very good that someone at a computer center,  dealership, or user group can provide you with a copy of StuffIt.   Once you have StuffIt (any version) you don't need BinHex.             If you're such a computer geek that the thought of actually  asking a living, breathing human being instead of a computer   terminal for something turns you into a quivering mass of   protoplasmic jelly, you can probably download a working copy  of  StuffIt from a local bulletin board system.            If you have religious objections to software gotten by any   means other than anonymous ftp, then I suppose I'll mention that   you can in fact ftp a working copy of StuffIt though this is by   far the hardest way to get it.  Ftp to wuarchive.wustl.edu and   login.  Type the word "binary."  Hit return.  Type "cd  mirrors/rascal.ics.utexas.edu/compression" and hit return.  Then  "get StuffIt_Expander_1.0.1_SEA_bin"  and hit return.  Of course  it's always possible that by the time you read this StuffIt  Expander will have been updated and the name changed so if this  fails look for something similar.  If you've ftp'd straight onto  your Mac you should now have a self-extracting archive which will  produce a working copy of StuffIt Expander when double-clicked.  If  you've ftp'd to your mainframe or UNIX account first, you still  need to use a modem program to download it to your Mac.  Just make  sure that the Mac is receiving in MacBinary mode and the mainframe  is sending in binary mode.  If you need more details on the last  step, consult the FAQ list for comp.sys.mac.comm and the manuals  for both your mainframe and Macintosh telecommunications software.      HOW CAN I GET BINHEX, STUFFIT, ETC. FROM A PC?  (2.7)       You can't.  There is absolutely NO way to get an executable  Macintosh file from an ftp site onto a PC and then onto your Mac  without some software obtained by means other than anonymous ftp.  You MUST beg, borrow, or steal the necessary software such as  Binhex or StuffIt Lite from another person.  I realize this may   terrify those among you who haven't left your parents' basement   since you got an  Apple II+ in 1980, but eventually you're going   to need to link up with some human being other than your mother.    (though I suppose if you're this much of  a nerd you could send   your mother out to get it for you.)  While you're gathering  your nerves for a venture into the strange and terrifying world   of daylight, please don't bother the net by asking this question  again.  There simply is no way to move executable Macintosh  programs from a PC or other non-Macintosh computer onto a   Mac without software that is not bundled with most Macs.=================================================================TROUBLESHOOTING: WHAT TO DO (BEFORE POSTING) WHEN THINGS GO WRONG (3.0)=================================================================          While the various FAQ lists cover a lot of specific  problems, there are far more problems that aren't covered here.   These are a few basic techniques you should follow before asking  for help.  You should probably also perform the ten-step  preventative maintenance routine described in section four,  especially rebuilding the desktop (4.3) and resizing the system  heap (4.5).  Following these steps may  or may not solve your  problem, but it will at least make it easier  for others to  recommend solutions to you. IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM.  (3.1)      "Microsoft Word is crashing" doesn't say much.  What were you  doing when it crashed?  Can you repeat the actions that lead to the  crash?  The more information you provide about the actions  preceding the crash the more likely it is someone can help you.   The more precisely you've identified the problem and the actions  preceding it (Step 1) the easier it will be to tell if the  following steps fix the problem.  For example, "Sometimes  QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes with a coprocessor not installed error." is  not nearly as helpful as "QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes when I link two  text boxes on a master page when copies of those text boxes already  contain text."  The former will leave you wondering whether the bug  remains after a given step.  The latter lets you go right to the  problem and see if it's still there or not. READ THE READ ME FILE.  (3.2)      Many companies include a list of known incompatibilities and  bugs in their READ ME files.  Often these aren't documented in the  manual. Read any READ ME files to see if any of the problems sound  familiar. CHECK FOR VIRUSES.  (3.3)      Run Disinfectant or another anti-viral across your disk.  Virus  infections are rarer than most people think, but they do occur and  they do cause all sorts of weird problems when they do. REINSTALL THE APPLICATION AND ALL ITS SUPPORT FILES.  (3.4)            For half a dozen reasons (external magnetic fields,  improperly written software, the alignment of the planets) a file  on a disk may not contain the data it's supposed to contain.  This  can cause all types of unexplained, unusual behavior.  Restoring  from original masters will normally fix this. REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE.  (3.5)        Bits are even more likely to get twiddled in the system file  than in the application and the effects can be just as disastrous.   See question 4.6 for a detailed procedure for performing a  clean  reinstall.            If the problem continues to occur after you've taken these  steps, chances are you've found either a conflict between your  application and some other software or a genuine bug in the  program.  So it's time to ISOLATE THE PROBLEM.  (3.6)            You need to find the minimal system on which the problem  will assert itself.  Here are the basic steps of isolating the  cause of a system or application crash:       a.Run only one application at a time. Occasionally applications do     conflict with each other.  If the problem does not manifest itself     without other applications running simultaneously, you can begin     launching other applications until you find the one that causes      the crash.          b.If you're running System 6, turn off MultiFinder.  If you're     running System 7, allot as much memory to the application as you      can afford.  Sometimes programs just need more memory, especially      when performing complicated operations.          c. If you're running System 7, turn off virtual memory and 32-bit     addressing.  There's still an awful lot of System 7 hostile     software out there including some from companies that really      have no excuse.  (Can you say Microsoft Word 5.1, boys and girls?       I knew you could.)  Some of this software only expresses its      incompatibilities when certain uncommon actions are taken.          d.Boot from a virgin system floppy.  If the problem disappears     you likely have an init conflict.  You need to progressively remove     extensions until the problem vanishes.  Use a little common sense     when choosing the first extensions to remove.  If the problem occurs     when you try to open a file, remove any inits that mess with the     Standard File Open procedure such as Super Boomerang first.  If the     problem remains after the obvious candidates have been eliminated,     either remove the remaining extensions one at a time or, if you have     a lot of them, perform a binary search by removing half of the     extensions at a time.  Once the problem disappears add half of the     most recently removed set back.  Continue until you've narrowed the     conflict down to one extension.  When you think you've found the     offending init restart with only that init enabled just to make      sure that it and it alone is indeed causing the problem. CONTACT TECHNICAL SUPPORT.  (3.7)      By now you should have a very good idea of when, where, and why  the conflict occurs.  If a tech support number is available for the  software, call it.  If you're lucky the company will have a work  around or fix available.  If not, perhaps they'll at least add the  bug to their database of problems to be fixed in the next release.     ======================  PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE  (4.0) ======================      You wouldn't drive your car 100,000 miles without giving it a  tune-up.  A computer is no different.  Regular tune-ups avoid a lot  of problems.  Although there are Mac mechanics who'll be happy to  charge you $75 or more for the equivalent of an oil change, there's  no reason you can't change it yourself.  The following nine-step  program should be performed about every three months.  TRASH UNNEEDED FILES  (4.1)      Many of the operations that follow will run faster and more  smoothly the more free disk space there is to work with so spend a  little time cleaning up your hard disk.  If you're at all like me,  you'll find several megabytes worth of preferences files for  applications you no longer have, archives of software you've  dearchived, shareware you tried out and didn't like, announcements  for events that have come and gone and many other files you no  longer need.  If you're running System 7 you may also have several  more megabytes in your trash can alone.  Throw them away and empty   the trash. RETHINK YOUR EXTENSIONS  (4.2)      Some Macintoshes attract inits like a new suit attracts rain.   Seriously consider whether you actually need every extension   in your collection.  If you don't use the functionality of an  extension at least every fifth time you boot up, you're probably  better off not storing it in your System Folder where it only takes  up memory, destabilizes your system, and slows down every startup.   For instance if you only read PC disks once a month, there's no  need to keep AccessPC loaded all the time.  Cutting back on your  extension habit can really help avoid crashes.  REBUILD THE DESKTOP  (4.3)      The Desktop file/database holds all the information necessary  to associate each file with the application that created it.  It  lets the system know what application should be launched when you  open a given file and what icons it should display where.   Depending on its size each application has one or more  representatives in the desktop file.  As applications and files  move on and off your hard disk, the Desktop file can be become  bloated and corrupt.  Think of it as a Congress for your Mac.   Every so often it's necessary to throw the bums out and start with  a clean slate.  Fortunately it's easier to rebuild the desktop than  to defeat an incumbent.            One warning: rebuilding the desktop will erase all comments  you've stored in the Get Info boxes.  Under System 7 Maurice  Volaski's freeware init CommentKeeper will retain those comments  across a rebuild.  CommentKeeper also works with System 6 but only   if Apple's Desktop Manager extension is also installed.            To rebuild the desktop restart your Mac and, as your  extensions finish loading, depress the Command and Option keys.   You'll be presented with a dialog box asking if you want to rebuild  the desktop and warning you that "This could take a few minutes."   Click OK. It will take more than a few minutes. The more files you  have the longer it will take.  If you're running System 6 you may  want to turn off MultiFinder before trying to rebuild the desktop.             If you're experiencing definite problems and not just doing  preventive maintenance, you may want to use Fifth Generation's  freeware init Desktop Reset.  Desktop Reset completely deletes the  Desktop file before rebuilding it, thus eliminating possibly  corrupt data structures.     ZAP THE PRAM AND RESET THE CLOCK  (4.4)      All Macs from the original 128K Thin Mac to the Quadra 950  contain a small amount of battery powered RAM to hold certain  settings that properly move with the CPU rather than with the disk  such as which disk to boot from.  Unfortunately this "parameter  RAM" can become corrupted and cause unexplained crashes.  To reset  it under System 7 hold down the Command, Option, P, and R keys  while restarting your Mac.  Under System 6 hold down the Command,  Option, and Shift keys while selecting the Control Panel from the  Apple menu. Click Yes when asked if you want to zap the parameter  RAM.  Since you've erased almost all the settings in the General  Control Panel, you should now reset them to whatever you want.            The one setting that zapping the PRAM does not erase is the   date and time; but since the internal clock in the Macintosh is  notoriously inaccurate you'll probably want to take this  opportunity to reset it anyway. RESIZE THE SYSTEM HEAP  (4.5)       Even after rethinking their extensions as per step two most  people still have at least half a row of icons march across the  bottom of their screen every time they restart.  All these  extensions (and most applications too) need space in a section of  memory called the System Heap.  If the System Heap isn't big enough  to comfortably accommodate all the programs that want a piece of  it, they all start playing King of the Mountain on the system heap,  knocking each other off to get bigger pieces for themselves and  trying to climb back on after they get knocked off.  All this  fighting amongst the programs severely degrades system performance  and almost inevitably crashes the Mac.           If you're using System 7, your Macintosh will automatically  resize the system heap as necessary; but if you're running System 6  it's important to set your system heap size large enough to manage  all your extensions and applications.  By default this size is set  to 128K, way too small for most Macs with any extensions at all.   The system heap size is stored in the normally non-editable boot  blocks of every system disk.  Bill Steinberg's freeware utility  BootMan not only lets you resize your system heap but even checks  how much memory your heap is already using so it can tell how much  needs to be allocated.  If you're running System 6, get BootMan,  use it, and be amazed at how infrequently your Macintosh crashes. REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE  (4.6)      System files can become corrupt and fragmented, especially if  you've stored lots of fonts and desk accessories inside them.   Merely updating the System software will often not fix system file  corruption.  I recommend doing a clean reinstall.  Here's how:    1.  Boot from the installer floppy of your System disks.      2.  Copy any non-standard fonts and desk accessories out         of your System file into a temporary suitcase.    3.  Trash the System file on your hard disk.  Also trash the         Finder, MultiFinder, DA Handler, and all other standard Apple         extensions like Control Panel and Chooser.  These will all be         replaced in the new installation.  If you're running or         installing System 7, move everything in the Extensions,         Control Panels, and Preferences folders into the top level         of the System Folder.    4.  Rename the System Folder.  Any name other than System Folder         is  fine.    5.  Double-click the installer script on your System disk.  Then         choose Customize...  Select the appropriate software for your         model Mac and printer.  You could do an Easy Install instead,         but that will only add a lot of extensions and code you don't         need that waste your memory and disk space.    6.  Once installation is finished, move everything from the         temporary folder you created in step 4 into the new System         folder.  If you're asked if you want to replace anything, you         forgot to take something out in step 3.  You'll need to replace         things individually until you find the duplicate piece.     7.  Reinstall any fonts or DA's you removed in step 2.    8.  Reboot.  You should now have a clean, defragmented System file         that takes up less memory and disk space and a much more stable         system overall.     DISK UTILITIES  (4.7)      Much like system files hard disks have data structures that  occasionally become corrupted affecting performance and even  causing data loss.  Apple includes Disk First Aid, a simple utility  for detecting and repairing hard disk problems, with its System  disks. It's also available for anonymous ftp from ftp.apple.com in  the  directory dts/mac/sys.soft/hdsc.  Even if you have an earlier   version, you should get the latest version (7.1) from ftp.apple.com  and run it on all your hard disks.              Several companies have released payware disk utilities that  detect and repair considerably more problems than Disk First Aid  though, interestingly, none of them detect and repair everything  that Disk First Aid does.  The three most effective for general  work are Central Point's MacTools Deluxe 2.0, Fifth Generation's  Public Utilites, and Symantec's Norton Utilities for the Macintosh  2.0.  A department or work group should have all of these as well  as Disk First Aid since none of them fix everything the others do.   For individuals MacTools ($48 street) is about half the price of  Norton ($94 street) or Public Utilities ($98 street) so, features  and ease of use being roughly equal, I recommend MacTools.            All of these products occasionally encounter problems they  can't fix.  When that happens it's time to backup (4.7) and  reformat (4.9).     BACKING UP  (4.8)      This is one part of preventative maintenance that should be  done a LOT more often than every three months.  The simplest back  up is to merely copy all the files on your hard disk onto floppies  or other removable media.  If you keep your data files separate  from your application and support files then it's easy to only back  up those folders which change frequently.  Nonetheless every three  months you  should do a complete backup of your hard disk.            A number of programs are available to make backing up  easier.  Apple included a very basic full backup application with  System 6.  With the Performas Apple ships a new Apple Backup  utility that can backup the entire disk or just the System folder  onto floppies.  The previously mentioned Norton Utilities for the  Mac and MacTools Deluxe 2.0 include more powerful floppy backup  utilities that incorporate compression and incremental backups.           Finally if you're lucky enough to have a Tape Drive, network  server, or removable media device to use for backups, you should  check out the more powerful payware utilities Redux ($49 street,  doesn't support tape drives) and Diskfit Pro ($74 street).  There  are NO freely available backup utilities other than the old HD  Backup from System 6.   DISK DEFRAGMENTATION  (4.9)      As disks fill up it gets harder and harder to find enough free  space in the same place to write large files.  Therefore the  operating system will often split larger files into pieces to be  stored in different places on your hard disk.  As files become more  and more fragmented performance can degrade.  There are several  ways to defragment a hard disk.           The most tedious but cheapest method is to backup all your  files, erase the hard disk (and you might as well reformat while  you're at it.  See question 4.10.), and restore all the files.            A number of payware utilities including Norton Utilities for  the Mac and Mac Tools Deluxe can defragment a disk in place, i.e.  without erasing it.  Although the ads for all these products brag  about their safety, once you've bought the software and opened the  shrink-wrap they all warn you to back up your disk before  defragmenting it in case something does go wrong.  There are NO  freeware or shareware disk defragmenters so please don't annoy the  net by asking for one.  REFORMAT YOUR HARD DISK  (4.10)      Just as a floppy disk needs to be initialized before use, so a  hard disk must be formatted before it can hold data.  You don't  need to reformat every three months; but when your system is  crashing no matter what you try, reformatting is the ultimate means  of wiping the slate clean.  Reformatting your hard disk may even  gain you a few extra megabytes of space.  Not all hard disks are  created equal.  Some can hold more data than others.  To facilitate  mass production and advertising without a lot of asterisks (* 81.3  megabytes is the average formatted capacity.  Your mileage may  vary.)  Apple often formats drives to the lowest common denominator  of drive capacity.  When you reformat there's no reason at all not  to reclaim whatever unused space Apple's left on your disk.              Unlike floppies hard disks need a special program to  initialize them. Most hard disks come with formatting software.   Apple's disks and System software ship with HD SC setup, a minimal  disk formatter which will format Apple brand hard drives ONLY.   Most other manufacturers ship appropriate formatting software with  their hard drives.  Normally this will be all you need to reformat  your hard disk.           A number of general-purpose formatters are also available  which go beyond the bundled software to include features like  encryption, password protection, multiple partitioning, faster disk  access, System 7 compatibility, and even compression.  Two of the  best are the payware Drive7 and Hard Disk Toolkit Personal Edition  ($49 street for either).  While there are one or two freeware  formatters available, none are likely to be superior to the ones  bundled with your hard disk.            PowerBook users should be sure to turn off Sleep and  processor cycling before reformatting their hard drives no matter  what software they use.  Otherwise disk corruption, crashes, and  data losses are a very good possibility.

The card has 3 Mb of VRAM on it, which means that 24-bit color is possible on the card!  The card supports just about any monitor scanrate you can think of (I used it at 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768, but itcan go higher).  You can switch resolutions and depth on the fly with asoftware control panel.  This is the ACCELERATED version of the card, which means all QuickDraw calls are not executed by the CPU but taken over by the video card, freeingup the mac processor for other tasks.   The cheapest I could find this card for when I called around last nightwas $1738 at Mac's Place.  I will sell it for $1250 + shipping.  It is justover a year old and never been any problem.  It comes with software and theoriginal manuals.  Hurry!Chris Magnusonchrism@col.hp.comHewlett-Packard Company(719) 590-2963

Several years ago these well-known machines sold for$30,000 for the base configuration. This particular one has much more than thebase configuration, depending on what you want:- 386 16 MHZ CPU.- 8 meg of ram.- Fifteen (15) serial ports (or more if you want)!- A multidrop port for up to 256 more serial ports!- Ethernet.- 5.25" floppy drive.- QIC 24 cartridge tape drive.- 170 meg ESDI hard drive (either Micropolis or CDC, or both if you want).- Unix System V.3 installation.- Networking software package (TCP/IP).- Development system software package (C compiler and libraries).I am asking only $700 (firm) for the system! If you want another Ethernet orserial card, add $50. Additional disks are $100 each (I can install a total ofthree ESDI drives). I would consider a trade for a SCSI DAT tape drive.This box would make a great BBS system or terminal server. It was originallydesigned to service 40 active users, and up to 70 moderately active users.This is NOT a PC! It was designed to be a Unix box from the start, and it'svery fast and exceptionally reliable.It's dimensions are approximately 2.5' high (tower), 8" wide and 2" deep.I am only interested in dealing with someone local enough to come pick it up.Shipping is way too much hassle.

It can also handle single sheets without removing the formfeedand has sophisticated preferences options (you can interactively programall the preferences to control the printer and get printed feedback withoutever using a computer).  You get prompts and menus to pick your current setupand default set up.  This was THE top of the line LQ dot matrix when I boughtit three years ago for $399.  It is also Epson LQ2500 compatible (besides it'sown modes) and comes with IBM driver software (which I've never used since Iown an Amiga).  Has a card slot for upgrading memory or fonts.

It is a P & S sealed to resist water to a depth of 12 feet. Itis not really an underwater camera but it has been great in wet anddusty conditions. It takes AA batteries (hooray). It has the solid,heavy feel of old-style Nikons and has taken all the abuse I havebeen able to give it. This includes a lot of water (rain, river andsea), desert and beach sand as well as being used as a weaponagainst a mugger. Shouting and swinging the camera by the strapdidn't scare the mugger away, hitting him with the flying cameradid. This is my, "never be without a camera" camera. The currentwater-resistant (Sport Touch I think is the name) model is nothinglike as solid or well sealed.Don Mackie - his opinions

My impression is that they try not to send it out to "browsers". Itappears that if your not a buyer or an engineer they do not want towaste a catalog on you.

The autograph is on a Senate Pass cardand is signed 'John Kennedy.'  I don't remember if it was signed 'Senator John Kennedy' or whether or not it was dated, because I haven'tlooked at it in quite a while.  Currently it is in a safety deposit box.I would rather sell to a private collector rather then go through an auctionhouse such as Christy's since that would tend to take away from the profit. If you (or any collector you may know) has an interest in this please sendme an e-mail expressing your interest.  I will see what I can do to make a scanned gif of it available to prospective buyers.

There is _nothing_ on the market, to myknowledge, that comes close to the specs of this plug-in.All of the above have service manuals.
