If the drive is formatted in a horizontal position, it can  not completely compensate for the gravitational pull in a vertical position.   I'm not saying that your hard disk will fail tomorrow or 6 months from now, but  why take that chance?

 44I have an old Mac Plus. A couple of years ago I bought a shiney new lc.It came with apple's new keyboard (with abd ports). i replaced it witha mac-pro-plus extended keyboard (which i thoroughly enjoy, thank youvery much). well, i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plusbut there's a little problem. the plus uses an rj-11 jack for keyboardinput and the new keyboards don't. i got an extra adb cable from mylocal apple dealer (they're such nice people), but they couldn't tellme the order of the wires. there are four wires in the adb cables: black, white, red, tan. I knowone's a ground, one gets the serial signal, one supplies 5 volts, andi forgot what the fourth one does. anyway, if you hook them up wrongyou'll fry a board and i <really> don't want to do <that>. if any brave souls out there have done this before, please e-mail yourexperience directly to me. i would greatly appreciate it especiallysince apple's original keyboard is not . . . ergonomically correct. btw, i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find thecorrelation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since ithas both, but no such luck (the connections are soldered inside oflittle boxes). Oh, well . . . one more thing: in case you are thinking that the ABD ports on thenewer models are different from the connection used on the plus---you're right. however, you can use the telephone cable from the plusand connect the mac-pro-plus keyboard via its own rj-11 jack. inother words, this little engineering feat i wish to do *is* possible.it's merely a matter of finding out the correct order. omt, when i get this to work, i definitely will post the solutionso others can, too. thanx for the input. ******************************************************************  Tis the blink of an eye, tis the draught of a breath,        **  From the blossoms of health, to the paleness of death,       **  From the gilded saloon, to the briar in the shroud,          **  O, why should the spirit of mortal be proud?                 **                                                 -William Knox *******************************************************************  shagberg@vm.cmp.ilstu.edu                                    ******************************************************************

 19Hi everyone. Just the other day, I ordered a VRAM chip for my new LCIII fromMac Connection. They sent it overnight (very nice) and I got it installed,and we found that it didn't work properly. When you put the computer in thousands mode, the bottom of the screen (using the new chip) is all flickeringand fuzzy. So I called them up and I'm going to return it for a new one.My question is, how often does such a thing happen with SIMM chips in general?Do you often find when ordering chips that a large portion are bad? Is thisa rarity? This is the first chip I've ordered so I have no other experiencein this area. I'm just curious if anyone else has had the same type ofexperience.That's about it. Please email me, and if people want, I can post a summary.Thanks all.-- Hillel Sims  -----  simsh@rpi.edu  -----  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"Is rot13 rotated 13 forward or backward?"--Anonymous

 9I recall reading that the Mac LC (and presumably the LC II & III) can use standard VGA monitors, with appropriate cable adapters.  I am uncertain of this since I have asked other people who say this is not so.  So can all vga monitors be used on the Mac LC?  What are the specs needed for a PC monitor to work with aMac LC (horizontal nad vertical frequencies)?

It would be interesting for Apple to come out witha NuBus PowerPC that allowed use of the CPU's 680x0, like RocketShare. But I guess that's getting a bit fantastic!I was wondering, since MacWeek reported that developers were 'seeded' withPowerPCs on a NuBus card.Also, any word on machine arrivals or estimated speed? Last I heard, the estimates were around 3-4 times the speed of a Quadra in native RISC mode. Iheard an Apple employee mumble something about the arrival of PowerPC machinesat a much earlier date that Q1 94, but I doubt it's true.Finally, is the PowerPC developer's CD 'mini-course' available? I saw it advertised in the developer's university calendar, and I'd like to know if it'sat all *interesting*.Sean--------------seanmcd@ac.dal.ca

The specs (to use the term loosely) are as follows:A/D: 16 bit converter, with 14 bit accuracy to 100 kHz, 12 bit accuracy to200 kHz. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. There are 8 multiplexedinputs sharing the single A/D, so that all inputs are not samples at thesame time, and in the above conversion specs the all-channel sample ratemust be used. Thus, for two channels, you only have 14 unknown quality bitsat 50 kHz per channel. This is poorer quality than the nationalInstruments, at the same sample rate.D/A: 16 bit converter. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. Each ofthe 4 output channels has its own converter.The price for the external converter box (the ITC-16), the NuBus interfaceboard (the MAC-23), plus C driver software and Igor XOP's is $2695.

 31I just hooked up my Mac IIsi to a relatively old (1 year?) Asante EN/SCadapter. The 10Base-T connection works like a charm. I installed thenewest drivers from Asante's ftp server.The problem begins when I attach one more device to the SCSI chain -specifically a 50MB drive. I power up the drive, then the Mac. The Mactests memory, etc. Just before the "happy Mac face" normally shows up, thepower light on the EN/SC goes out, and the boot process stops. So I can usethe network, or the external drive, but not both at once. This makes theAsante box pretty much unusable.It doesn't look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turnon the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn't get noticedduring the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapterworks, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. The Mac has*never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and I've hadit for over a year).Here is what I tried: changing the SCSI ID's of the EN/SC and the disk --several permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the EN/SC at thehead or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator(both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internalresistors from the hard disk; trying another EN/SC box; trying anotheridentical drive; trying several different SCSI cables.Has anybody seen this? More importantly, does anyone have a solution?Thanks a lot.    E.-- Eric Behr, Illinois State University, Mathematics Departmentbehr@math.ilstu.edu   or   behr@ilstu.bitnet  (please avoid!)
 15Readers,I have found that the cache upgrade options for the Mac IIsi include thefollowing:1) AE QuickSilver2) Daystar Fastcache IIsi3) Daystar ComboCache IIsi4) LogiCache IIsi 64k cacheI'd be interested in hearing opinions on any or all of these options.The other alternative is to upgrade to a CPU accelerator such as theLogiCache 50 MHz.

However, the Mac SE cannot DISPLAY grayscale onThe original poster (W G Wright) posted an item saying that he had bought a newwizz-bang Laser Printer from Apple (a Select 300 I think) which can printGrayScale. He then said that he CANNOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer(and also that all the 'experts' he has dealt with agree that it is notpossible).This is the one major bugbear about doing a 3rd party SE upgrade (compared toApple's SE to SE/30 upgrade): you will never be able to run Color Quickdraw. Itis Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND Grayscale.SEs CAN print some COLOUR: this is because Quickdraw - the original, non-colourversion, has the right hooks for eight colours. Some of you will remember the'SCSIgraph' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE (I think that itgave you sixteen colours by dithering or something).There is no reason that Apple couldn't release software patches for oldercomputers (there are lots of Mac Pluses, Classics and SEs that have beenupgraded to 68020 and 68030 processors which should be perfectly able to dealwith Color Quickdraw) - but they wont, and 3rd parties are having a difficult time in duplicating the Mac's ROMs (i.e. Nutek et al.).Just one Caveat: I would have thought that if you were printing a POSTSCRIPTGrayscale image onto a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale printer, that you would be able todo so, whatever Mac you were using. (And I am pretty sure that the Select 300is NOT a POSTSCRIPT printer [? correct me if I'm wrong?]).Phil RyanMelbourne, Australia

 14I recently purchased a Centris 610 and am having difficulty gettingmy computer to recognize my hard disk drive (external) Using both thedisk uitily of TMS (Diskwriter) and Jasmine's software, neither onewill show the drive.  The drive is the only device connected to the scuzzi port. I cant find the manual to the tms pro 120 and seem toremember that it is "terminated".  Is there something else that I amdoing (or not doing) that does not allow my 610 to recognize my externaldisk drive?.thanks in advance for the information.-- Eugene E.

 24I recently aquired a Quantum Q250 harddisk. It is a 50 meg 5.25"mechanism. It is SCSI. I have a few questions and a few problems. Firstthere seems to be an extra connector socket on the back that I can'tfigure out what it is for. The address is set by some jumpers on thebottom so I don't think it is for that. Any ideas?Second, it would be nice to get a hardware manual for the drive. There area lot of jumpers on it that we don't know what they are for.Third, I have got the drive to format. It took a while to get things towork and most of it is fine for now. The formating initialy wastroublesome but seems to be ok. The main problem is if you do a reset onthe MacPlus the drive disappears. If I shut the mac off and then back onagian then the drive comes up fine. Any ideas.Please reply to one of the email addresses below.ThanksRichard CrispinDepartment of Psychology    email:rcrispin@watarts.uwaterloo.caUniversity of Waterloo            psych@watserv1.uwaterloo.caWaterloo, Ontario           phone:(519)888-4781  or 885-1211 ext. 4781Canada   N2L 3G1            fax:(519)746-8631

Well,think again.  Sometimes the only real support out there is what Applecomputer users can give to each other.  For another example, read on:In the March 15th issue of _MacWeek_, Ric Ford described a two-year effortby Liam Breck to document and bring to Apple's attention a problem withcertain defective mice.  At random, the switches on these mice "stick" inthe down position until clicked a second time, apparently regardless of themachine they are used with or the system software involved. Most of thereported problem mice were manufactured in Malaysia and have an FCC ID ofBCGA65431. You'll recognize this "sticky button" symptom immediately if youhave such a mouse: the problem is intermittent, but it's not subtle.Liam Breck recently gave up trying to document this problem, and instead suggested that people contact Apple's Customer Assistance Center directly(_MacWeek_ 4/5/93 p. 64). When I called Apple on March 23rd and describedmy defective mouse, I was eventually given a case number (F83Y) and toldApple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out ofwarranty.  After waiting for three weeks, I called back today wonderingwhere my new mouse was. This time, I was told that Apple had decided theserial number on my mouse (MB13831FC25) is not within the (undisclosed)range Apple is willing to replace, and there is nothing I can do about it.Nothing, that is, unless enough people complain about this problem to makeit worth Apple's while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice.Please, if you have one of these mice, I NEED YOUR HELP! Don't assume youknow what causes the problem (there are _lots_ of theories) and starthacking around inside your hundred-dollar mouse. Instead, let Apple do it.Please take five minutes to CALL APPLE RIGHT NOW at:                  United States      1-800-776-2333                  Canada             800-665-2775                  UK and Europe      33-1-49-01-49-01                  Australia          61-2-452-8000                  Japan and Pacific  81-3-5411-8500If the number isn't toll-free, call collect.  Describe the problem and askfor a replacement mouse.  Even if they refuse, insist that they registerthe details of your case, including your mouse's serial number.  Be firm.Network managers and user-group leaders especially, please query your userbases. Everyone ask your friends and colleagues.  Please don't send mail tome or post yet another "sticky-button" report, CALL APPLE DIRECTLY!  Ifenough victims take the trouble to report this well-known problem, Applewill eventually be forced to respond.  If Apple continues to find it easyto stone-wall on this issue, don't expect them to offer support when thenext, potentially more serious Mac defect is uncovered.-- Bill Sloan

 3I remember someone mention about a 150meg syquest.  Has anyone elseheard anything about this?  I'd be interested in the cost per megabyte and theapproximate cost of the drive itself and how they compare to the Bernoulli 150.
 9I have access to a DEC TLZ06 DEC DAT tape backup.  What do I need to interfacemy SE/30 to the tape backup.  The tape backup is a SCSI.  Will Norton Utilitiesbe sufficient to interface the two? ************************************************************************Jason YowHuman Factors Psychology ProgramWright State University, Dayton, OHE-mail: jyow@desire.wright.edu************************************************************************

PDS (processor direct slot) is just that:here are all the connections to the processor. You can do anything withthis and it is as quick as it can be, but there's no cooperation. Youmay be able to get double PDS slot adaptors but you try plugging 2video cards in, and just watch them conflict! Of course, the extra electronics in a NuBus slot makes it appreciably more expensive, soguess why Apple doesn't put it in it's cheaper machines?So, yah pays yer money and yah takes yah choice.Bill (wis@liverpool.ac.uk)

[for MDs]>>By giving the 2.5"MO a floppy interface it could reduce the price of it and>make it easily installed in existing devices.This question is, to me, like asking "Why use SCSI at all?"- Due to the rather primitive standard DMA solution (which is used by almost all  floppy interfaces) of PCs, the speed is limited to approx 500 Kbytes/s.   I want a standard allowing higher performance.- With SCSI, the OS can issue a request to the disk and then go ahead with other  things. Later, when the controller has performed the search and physical read,  data can be transferred to main memory at "RAM speeds". Not very relevant with  MS-DOS, but MS-DOS is not made for the future.- I've *got* a SCSI interface. I've got a 5.25" and a 3.5" floppy, too, and I am  not going to throw them out. With SCSI I may add, for all practical purposes,  an "unlimited" number of disk units without sacrificing any of my old disks. - For my PC, I've got a 300 Mbyte SCSI disk adopted from a SUN machine, and I  can carry it over to a Mac, a Sparcstation, an Alpha machine... whatever I like  to, if I decide to turn my back to the PC. (I *do* know that I cannot expect  to move the data without reformatting!)There are probably numerous other reasons for SCSI as well.>After all it is a floppy replacement we are taking about. 128Mb isnt all that>much, so it isnt going to replace the need of a fast fixed disk.No, not replace, but supplement. And contrary to a floppy, a MD may be fast enoughto run programs (or access data) directly off the MD. So we'll have much higherexpectations/demands, which is much better supported by SCSI than the old floppyinterface. And the price of SCSI controllers is not that high any more - isn't itsomething like a dozen large pizzas, nowadays? :-)ka.

 22I purchased an LCIII recently and had heard a bit about a re-work of thelogic board.  I opened mine up and found the same re-work, with a smallchip glued to the board and a couple of green wires running from it to two other chips.  I'd like to know more about it.  Could anyone with any or all ofthe following information please post it?  Thanks a bunch.1.What does the re-work accomplish (i.e., what does it fix)?2.What are the technical details of the re-work?  (I'm looking forthings such as the purpose of the chips with the new wires connected,and the pin-outs for those chips.)3.Is a board with the re-work any different functionally from one without?4.Could the re-worked boards be incompatible with future releases ofthe operating system?and, finally,5.Should I even be concerned about any of this?Keith Folsomfolsom@cup.portal.com
 15A local dealer is offering Mac II vi machines equipped with Kodak multi-session compatible CD-ROM drives for what seems like an attractive price:$1500. I've used many other models up to a II ci, but this would be thefirst I could have my own Mac. Is it safe to buy an about-to-be discontinuedmodel such as this. I'd like to yank the CD-ROM drive out, put it in ahousing and share it with my PC. Is this feasible? The only info I have onthe II vi is that it is relatively slow (16MHz), has an 68030 chip with amath coprocessor. I want to add a non-Apple portrait monitor and use thismachine for HyperCard stack design. Is this a good buy, or would I bewasting my money? I would appreciate some advice.

 30Message-ID: <1r7sshINNpvq@senator-bedfellow.MIT.EDU>NNTP-Posting-Host: alfredo.mit.eduHere's the scoop:For the past two years, I have been using an SE/30 with a Sony 1304s anda Lapis video card.  This past month, I bought a Quadra 800 and am now using the Sony on it.  My SE/30 has been shipped home to my father whois planning on getting an Apple 14" monitor (The Trinitron one).  Myquestion is this:  What kind of power cord will he get with the Applemonitor.  Does it come with two types?  As I recall, one can hook up thepower cord of an apple monitor to the back of a machine such as my Quadra 800.  However, for my father's SE/30, there is no extra plug whichallows use of the SE/30's power supply.  He needs to plug it into thesocket separately.  So...does the monitor come with a cable that will allowhim to do this?  Will have to buy a different cable?  IF yes, where can hepurchase such a cable? or apple kind enough to provide both types of cables?Thanks in advance,Derek******************************************************************************  DEREK FONG                           *   EMAIL: thewho@plume.mit.edu  Dept. of Physical Oceanography       *          thewho@darla.whoi.edu------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bldg 54-1511A                          * Clark Laboratory 317Massachusetts Institute of Technology  * Woods Hole Oceanographic InstitutionCambridge, MA 02139                    * Woods Hole, MA 02543(617) 253-2922                         * (508) 457-2000 x2814*******************************************************************************

 31I'm considering buying one of these to offload the internal videoin my IIci and to get 24 bit color capability on my 13" monitor. What'sthe deal on them?1) Do they come with varying amounts of RAM? If so, what is the maxand min? How much do I need for 640 x 480 x 24 bits?2) What bit depths are supported? One, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24?3) Are all these cards accelerated or just some? Is it true thatmodern accelerated video cards are (at least in general) faster? Whatbit depths are accelerated, all or just 24 bit? I've heard that someapplications actually run *slower* with this card if they write directlyto the screen (or something like that). Is this a frequent problem?How much slower is it?4) Didn't I read (when System 7 first came out) that the card wasincompatible? If so, how was this corrected (Finder patch, some INIT,or other)? Has it been kept compatible with 7.1? Are there many otherapps that it is incompatible with (games or important (i.e., non-Microsloth) apps, for example)?5) If you have a strong opinion on it's value for someone in my position,let me know what you think a reasonable price is to pay for it.Thanks a lot for you input.Rick-------------------------------------------------------------------Rick Roy       Usenet: rick@howtek.MV.com       America Online: QEDDisclaimer: My employer's views are orthogonal to these.The early bird got worms.

The consensus at the timewas that the IWII would not work there.  As I will be moving there this summer,I called Apple to make sure and they told me (today) that the IWII (as boughtin the U.S.) will definitely run on 50 Hz AC current (as long as a step-downconverter is employed if 240 V current is used).  The same info, turns out, canbe found in the IWII manual (p. 127 in the 1989 version), but I didn't reallytrust that.  Does anyone have any direct experience to the contrary?  Just wondering.Chris W.

 23The Quadra 700 goes thru extensive initalize routines of its hardware,read's PRAM, obtains all info from last session including the volumesetting, and then executes the sound procedure for the startup sound, andwait's on the SCSI controller to respond to the boot up code.If the DRAM produces an error, or a registers cannot be read from a device,or the device corrupts that address/data or control paths, then if it ispossible, the firmware branchs to another sound routine that produces the 'sad mac' sound.This is a general breifing of the start up procedure of a typical mac.If you cannot control the volume of the quadra, even at boot up, then i feelthere is something incorrect with the logic board. My Quadra 700 does not show the problems you are having.Steve H

 46I am having trouble with SCSI on a Mac IIfx. The machine is 3 years oldand I have been using the same hard drive (internal Maxtor LXT-200S) fortwo and a half years. The disk recently crashed. I reformatted (Silverlining5.42), but during the reformat I received random write errors during testing.The error message reported was like:Sector 0: Write error detected after testing good - sector not mapped out.This occurred randomly all over the hard disk (which makes me suspect thediagnostic's reference to Sector 0 ??? ). On the third reformat and afterreinstalling the SCSI read/write loops I was able to get through passes2,3, and 4 with no errors. (Pass 1 for some reason reported a lot of errors,but still mapped out no sectors.) I decided to go ahead and try to resinstallSystem 7 and reload my data from a backup. This proceded normally; however,I now have sub-optimal performance. Symptoms include:   o Frequent crashes   o Instances of extremely sluggish disk access requiring a reboot to       correct.   o Instances of not finding the disk on the SCSI chain on reboot.       - If I boot from Norton Utl. after this occurs, it cannot find the         disk either.       - The only thing that fixes this is recycling the power. It sometimes         requires several attempts.QUESTIONS:   1) Has anyone had this type of problem before?   2) Is the problem with the fx motherboard (And its non-standard      SCSI implementation) or with my Maxtor Disk? Is there some      diagnostic software that would help me make this determination?   3) Is it a termination problem? I currently have external Syquest      and an external DataFrame XP60 on the chain. The XP60 is at the      end, and has internal termination; so I am not using the IIfx      terminator. I do have the SCSI filter installed on the internal      drive. I have run with this exact steup for 2 1/2 years with      one previous disk crash requiring a reformat (about a year ago).      I also have symptoms if I disconnect the external devices;      so I don't see how SCSI termination would now be an issue. Of      course who knows :-<Help would be much appreciated.Forrest E.

I have been told thatthe built-in video should support at least 16bit and maybe 24bit color ona Macintosh Color Display.  However, the Monitors control panel stilllists 8bit (256 colors) as the highest possible.Does it make any difference which slots you put the SIMMs in?Do you have to do something to activate them?Do you have to do something to the Monitors control panel?BTW, I am running System 7.1 with 8 Megs of RAM.---Charles P.

 87I have replaced the osz to 66 MHz yesterday and no truble at all. My Quadra now works at 33 MHz stable for more than 14 hours. I have also tried a 70 MHz osz, but after 1/2 hour my Quadra 700 died. I am not sure what was the reason for that,but it is to risky to run it to fast. Most of your Quadras 700 should work at 33 MHz without any problems. But a safety tip do a backup from your harddisk befor you start to upgrade. During my 35 MHz test I damaged my harddisk and had a hardtime to get it working again. So once again do a backup befor you start!!!!!!!!!Now the speedometer results after replacing the osz.Speedometer Report for menes rainer.

Two points which my cause problems are the 4 MByte Ram solder on the board. The are only 80ns Rams and run at the upperlimit with 33 MHz. The next part which may cause trouble are the Video Rams. I have the orignal 100ns VRAMs from Apple in my Quadra, here you are also at the upperlimit where most of the chips running but it isn't garantied to run. Most of the other parts on the Quadra board running on there own clockspeed so they wont make truble.The most importaned question is do I neat a new heat sink. I would say NO. After running my Quadra for more than 14 hours the heat sink is really cool. A 33 MHz 486 with heat sink is mutch warmer than the 68040 in the Quadra, so I didn't see any problems. The room temperatur was 22 Celsius (72 F). If you living in a area were it is hot 100 F (45 C) and your room temperatur is not mutch below I would suggest a new heat sink with a ventilator to stay on the safe side.Hope you will have the same success than I had,Raineremail: menes@statistik.tu-muenchen.de
 31The internal HD in my LC disappeared for a day last week, and I'd like tohear any (reasonable) theories folks can suggest for what happened.It is an LC, with 10MB of RAM and an 80MB internal drive, running system7.1, with a few SCSI devices in a (so far as I know) properly terminatedchain.I had shut down the system for a day-- I was out of town and we sometimeshave thunderstorms this time of year-- and upon restarting got a blinkingquestion mark.  I booted from a floppy and saw that my external HD seemedokay, but there was no sign of the internal.I installed a system folder on the external and was, indeed, able to bootfrom it.  I tried things like Disk First Aid and Silverlining, to inquireabout the internal drive.  They either could not find it or got errors intrying to talk to it. (Silverlining claimed it was a Connor drive, but itis a Quantum... )Well, I'd backed things up, so I was able to work.  But, at some point Inoticed that the internal had reappeared.  Now, Disk First Aid says thatall's well, etc.  Things seem to be fine.But, what happened?  Was this a warning that something (the internal HDor something else) is about to die?  I'm definitely nervous.And, if this is a signal that the internal HD is sick, is it true that Ican only put up to a 127MB drive inside an LC?  Some folks have claimedthere's a limitation in the LC (other'n size or power) while others (andthat includes LaCie, over the phone) say anything that fits is okay.Thanks for answers.

Some newdrives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of datawrites. Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to performa test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physicaltolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some*track drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. Thisbecomes especially critical at very high recording densities, andso was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but itseems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way ofboosting the drive's long-term reliability and MTBF ratings.I first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointedout that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times whendigitizing, say, audio or video to hard disk. Some manufacturersexplicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are NOTto be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes.Hope this helps.Victor

 18OK...here is my question.  I want to hook up my PowerBook 160 toa SVGA monitor but I do not want to buy the PowerBook/DOS Companion.  Cananyone tell me the EXACT cable I need to connect them?  If there is sucha cable, can I purchase it from MacWharehouse or some computer store?If I must buy the cable from James Engineering, how much do they run andhow can I get a hold them???

 17I purchased 2x8 MB 72-pin (60 ns) SIMMs for my Quadra 800 from ChipMerchant (I've been very satisfied with them in the past).  Either onealone works, but both together fail.  I called Apple for advice and wastold that there was a problem with "Composite" SIMMs.  Only non-compositeSIMMs should be used with the Q-800.  Chip Merchant confirmed that theypresently sell only composite 72-pin SIMMs.  So, Q-800 SIMMs need to beboth 60 ns and non-composite.Marty Sachs----------------------------------------------------------------USDA/ARS & Agronomy/UIUC    msachs@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu [internet]S108 Turner Hall            msachs@UIUCVMD [bitnet] 1102 S.

Checking my memory map thanks to Now Menus,I see that HP Backgrounder has not loaded. Restarting fixes this. Itseems to me that HP Backgrounder is quitting unexpectedly, and that itsstatus as "Multifinder NOT aware" allows it to do this without my beinginformed by a message such as "HP Backgrounder quit unexpectedly." Haveyou ever seen this problem before.        There may or may not be a related problem. I have experiencedproblems in putting my computer to sleep. Choosing "sleep" from theFinder menu sometimes does nothing. Today on a whim I checked the memorymap, and I discovered that HP backgrounder was not loaded. Restartedreloaded HP backgrounder, and I was able to put my machine to sleep asusual. Just a mere coincidence or is the HP backgrounder crash preventingmy machine from going to sleep?Has anyone seen this problem? I'm seriously considering the purchase ofa StylewriterII because of the poor quality of the HP software. Please send your answers directly to me and post to the net.Yours truly,Marc Bizer

 32In the last two weeks I have the following problem on two 160's1 has a 8Mb Simm and the other a 6 Mb simmBoth are about 2 -3 months old, bought from different vendors and installedby different people. Both computers begin crashing frequently, locking up and ultimately theMemory Chimes.  Crashes would almost always occur if you moved the screenand sometimes would occur when you weren't even touching the computer.  Inboth cases, taking the machine apart, taking the memory out and putting itback in solved the problem for awhile but then it would comeback,  mymarginally educated guess as to what's happening is that larger SIMMS are"lopsided" in that the insertion point is sort of a pivot point and aftertime they begin to move about - possible because of pressure on thekeyboard or something?  Anyway, has anyone else had such a problem or solution - If somehow youcould support the other end of the simm to prevent it from moving.I've had no problem for the past 3 weeks by replacing my 8Mb simm with a2Mbsimm -although this is NOT desireble solution.Please email any resp - and/or post if usefull to the rest of the world.TedTed SchreiberMechanical Enginering Northwestern UniversityTel: 708.491.5386 FAX 708.491.3915 Email: rts@nwu.edu

 12HelloI recently accelerated my Mac Plus (MicroMac 25MHz accelerator) and now I can't get my Mac to boot off of the hard disk.  It boots fine from a floppy, and I can mount the hard disk using SCSI probe, but I cannot get it to boot from the hard drive.  I installed a new driver, so I don't think that is the problem.  This poses a rather large problem.  I only have 4 Meg of RAM, and I need to run Mathematica, which requires 5 Meg.  I was hoping to use system 7 virtual memory so that I could run Mathematica.  However, I can't run system 7 from a floppy, so I can't get enough RAM.  Any suggestions? Thanks for your time--Chrisw@yang.earlham.edu

 14I have a mac plus with 2.5MB RAM. I have just bought an extra 2MB so thatI can have the max 4MB RAM that a plus supports. However, I can't get itto boot after I install the 2 extra SIMMs. Instead I get a sad mac (Sorry,but I can't remember the code). Looking at the motherboard, I can seethat 2 resistors have been snipped off where it says "256Kb path -1 row". I assume that was done when the first 1MB SIMMs were added.So, my question is: Are there any other resistors that need snipping? or, Do I have bum SIMMs which need to be exchanged?Any and all advice will be appreciated.Chris Gatenbygatenb@mrisun.med.yale.edu

 24Nntp-Posting-Host: hengill.rhi.hi.isHello all.I am thinking about buying an external monitor for my SE/30 and waswondering if anyone out in netland has any advice for me.I am mostly thinking about a 14" color monitor and an 8 bit card thatcan switch between 640*480 and something higher (like 800*600).  I read anold report on a card from Lapis that could do this, but could not use theexternal monitor as the main screen (with menubar) which to me is a major draw-back.  Has this perhaps been fixed? Or can any other cards do this (like theMicron Xceed) ?Also which monitor should I buy?  At the moment I am leaning towardsthe Sony 1304, 1304s or 1320 (what exactly is the difference between these?)but are there any other good cheap monitors I should know about?  Doesn't themonitor have to be multisync to support cards that can switch resolutions?Please send me e-mail and I'll summarize.I would also greatly appreciate getting the e-mail addresses of any mail ordercompanys that sell monitors or cards.Thanks in advanceEggert ThorlaciusUniversity of Iceland

This isa fact. By writing directly to the hardware on an SE, it ispossible to have 4 simultaneous channels of sampled sound (11kHz) fora cost of approx. 8000 cycles. Exactly how would you do that usingthe SM, pray tell?The correct thing to do is to use the SM on the machines that cancarry that extra load using the SM means, and to write directlyto the sound hardware on the machines that can't. It's not thepolitically correct thing, but from the developers' point ofview it is.Christer Ericson --- Internet: christer@cs.umu.se --- tel: +46-90-166794Department of Computer Science, University of Umea, S-90187 UMEA, SWEDEN

As you can wellimagine, I got nearly one hundred responses, so I figured I'd thankyou all here instead of individually.The tallies:I got one vote for A/UX, which runs on the Macintosh.I got several nays for Commodore's 3000UX system.Most people agreed that SGI's were nice, and very very expensive.Some (devoted) Sun users nearly insisted that I try to find a usedSun, say a 3/60 or 3/80.About a dozen people told me how they love their NeXT...only now NeXTis out of the hardware business (see below).And most of the other 85+ people said:  Get a 486 box, and run someversion of Unix that's available either in the Public Domain orcommercially.=============And so I weighed my options.  What stood out, in my opinion, was thatthere were several different versions of Unix available on one system:the 486 (PC) architecture.  If I bought a Sun, I'd have to use SunOS.If I bought a (used) NeXT, I'd have to use NeXTSTEP (see below).  Adnauseum.But with a PC, I can run Linux, which is a small user-friendly (?)flavor that uses shared libraries to cut down on volume, although Ihear its networking abilities aren't up to speed with 386bsd, anotherPD (==free) port (which takes up a lot more space).  I can purchaseBSD386 (commercial product) if I choose.  There are several othercommercial packages available.So, what I've found out (after pricing systems, etc.), is that I canget a really good Unix workstation for as little as ~$2500.  Includingsource code!Or, for ~$3500-4000, I can get an unbelievable EISA bus 486-66DX2system, fully blown, and run single user BSD386.What I'm really excited about, though, is NEXTSTEP for Intel.  NeXTchanged into a software company only, and they are releasing their OSfor PC's.  I've used NeXT's before, and I absolutely loved them.Everyone who wrote me about NeXT (or NEXTSTEP) commented on thedeveloper's environment, and how well designed the whole package is.===========So, my choice is to:1)  Wait for the mail on Monday, so I can read what NEXTSTEP's systemrequirements are2)  If I'm wowed on what they say, I'll buy a system that fits intotheir criteria    2a)  Get NEXTSTEP3)  If I'm wowed, but I can't afford it yet (most likely), I'll buy asystem that fits their criteria    3a)  Get Linux or 386bsd, as a temporary learning experience so Ican save up for NEXTSTEP4)  If I'm not sufficiently wowed (least likely), I'll buy a systemthat is slightly less blown out (like a 486DX 25, ISA) and put Linuxor 386bsd on it.================Again, thanks to everyone around the net.

 16I have done several of these upgrades (about 6 IIsi's, and 1 Quadra 700), andthe best thing to use would be some sort of "heat sink compound". If possible,you should look for the silicon-free stuff. There's a comany who makes the stuffcalled Tech Spray, their address is: P.O. Box 949, Amarillo, TX 79105.You should be wary in using most kinds of tape; and definately don't use ducttape  that stuff is for ducts...When using the heat sink glue or compound, only use enough to fill the smallspace between the heat sink and the CPU.Mario Murphy**** From Planet BMUG, the FirstClass BBS of BMUG.

 28 I just thought I would pass along my experience with APS. I recently ordered an external Quantum 240. The salesperson was friendly and knowledgeable, the order came when promised, and the invoice was at the price quoted.  Installing the drive was simple; I didn't even have to read the manual. The SCSI address is set by a pushbutton arrangement. I daisy-chained the drive from my Syquest (also from APS) and booted up with no problems.  I'm still going through all the shareware that comes on the drive. It's a pretty good assortment. The drive/fan is a bit noisier than I would like, but I think it'll be OK. The speed seems very good, although I haven't run any objective tests. It also seems to spin up pretty quickly; I can hit the power switch for it, and almost immediately power the Mac without any problems booting from the drive. Some observations: the case is plastic (good quality, though) while my older Syquest case is metal. There is one LED, which is normally green, and flickers red as the drive is accessed.

 31Message-ID: <MfohvGq00WBME4yado@andrew.cmu.edu>NNTP-Posting-Host: po2.andrew.cmu.eduHi.  I am working on a project for my marketing class and I'd like toask your help.  The assignment is to come up with a product and create amarketing plan for it.  Technical issues are not terribly important atthis point.  Well, my group's plan is to market a "full page" monitorfor laptop computers.  It would be a third-party product to be installedby authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology's PaletteBookscreen).  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that youwould get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember,technical issues aside!).  In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screenand the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR "full" height. The screen would probably be monochrome.The motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be verypopular among business people.  Business people also commonly use wordprocessing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenientto see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users andapplications, color screens aren't really a neccessity.  We couldhopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000.Now, please don't write this off as completely ridiculous.  I reallyneed some constructive feedback.  So, if you would, please reply to mevia email and let me know:1. If you would consider buying a "full page" laptop screen2. How much you would be willing to pay for it3. Any helpful commentaries on the ideaAlso, if you take this idea and make a lot of money off it (doubtful,but who knows!), please send me some.Thanks in advance!!!-Mike

Complete Q700 are best obtained from your dealer or some recentcopy of MacWorld or MacUser.  My foggy memory suggests that the most relevantcomparison factors vis-a-vis a IIci are as follows:  25 MHz 68040  16 Mhz data path (don't recall this for sure, but it's slower      than Q 950 style machines for sure).  Ethertalk card on-board  Audio in/out  4 MB RAM on motherboard  4 SIMM slots  2 NuBus slots.  More flexible build-in video than the CI.  Uses VRAM.In comparison, a IIci with an accelerator won't give you  audio or ethernet  or the same video options.  With a 68040 accelerator, CPU performance can be comparable but I  think it ends up costing more.Greg Dudek

 20Hi everyone. I recently posted about how I received a bad vram chip for mynew LCIII, and someone responded that it may not actually be bad, but it maybe a 512K LC vram chip, and thus doesn't work properly with my computer. SoI'm wondering if anyone can interpret these codes for me, so I can figureout what type of chip MacConnection sent me.Each chip says: M518121A-80J 2515251On the back of the card, it says 0593I believe from the numbers that means it is an 80ns chip, but I can't figureout what the size is supposed to be. If anyone can help, I'd be grateful.Please email me your response.

 84Well, here are the results of the Mathematica test which I posted tothis newsgroup.

And, it is unclear whether the '040 processor on the non-FPU system(a 68LC040) can be replaced with a 68RC040 supplied by another vendor.Apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the Centris 610, which ONLYcomes with a non-FPU 68LC040 processor CANNOT be upgraded to support an FPU -the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you cannotswap one for another (again, according to Apple's memo).Hope that helps.Kevin LohmanUniversity Book Store, University of WashingtonBuyer for the UW Apple Computers for Education Program

The third-party media adapters are usually cheaper (at least in Toronto) thanApple's. I bought the adapters from Asante instead of Apple.gurman@umbra.gsfc.nasa.gov (Joseph B. Gurman) writes:>    The DECstation 5000 Models 200 and 240 come with ThinWire only>(can't say for certain about the Models 125 and 133), so your best betThat's not true. Only the DECstation 5000/200 comes with a Thinwire(BNC, coaxial) Ethernet connector. The 5000/25, 5000/133 and 5000/240all have a single 15-pin AUI Ethernet connector only. I distinctlyremembered this because when got the 5000/200 first and I thought allof them are going to be Thinwire. I eventually had to go back and orderedDESTAs (DEC's oversized version of an AUI-to-BNC adapter that MUST be usedwith a transciever cable) for the rest of the stations.My advise to the very original poster (Beverly?) is:(1) If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and won't add    machines to it EVER, go for Thinwire regardless of the media type. Going    for UTP (unshielded twisted pair) wiring requires a concentrator which    means extra money and I believe these units come with at least 6 ports.    As for Thicknet, it's a nightmare and cabling is expensive. Avoid it    unless you have no choice (e.g. the two machines are two floors parts).(2) On the Mac side, you will need:    - one Thinwire media adapter (from Apple or third-party).    - MacX (make sure you get version 1.2; 1.1.7 won't run on System 7.1).    - MacTCP (which comes with MacX; if you get MacX v1.2, you should be      getting MacTCP v1.1.1 with it. Don't use earlier versions on a Centris).    - you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the      Thinwire media adapter. So just ask the sales if the adapter is      self-terminated or not.    - configure MacTCP to use "Ethernet".(3) On the DECstation side, you will need:    - for a Model 200, you will only need a T-connector.    - for Models 25, 125, 133, 240, you will need an AUI-to-BNC adapter.      Get one that can be plugged in directly to the AUI port of the      DECstation. This way you save the cost of a transciever cable      (a 15-pin AUI male to a 15-pin AUI female cable).    - get a 25ohm terminator.Your two-machine network will look like this:       ##T----------------------------------------------[]      +-----+                                           |      |     |                                           |      +-----+                                         +-----+                                                      |     |                                                      +-----+    DECstation                                        Centris     5000/200                                           650                              OR       ##T----------------------------------------------[]        {=}                                             |      +-----+                                           |      |     |                                         +-----+      +-----+                                         |     |                                                      +-----+    DECstation                                        Centris5000/25,125,133,240                                     650            ##    -> 25ohm terminator   T     -> T connector   ---   -> Thinwire (RG58 coaxial cable)   {=}   -> AUI-to-BNC (i.e. Thick-to-Thin) adapter   []    -> Thickwire media adapter (assuming self-terminated)   |   |Andy-- Andy Sun (andy@ie.utoronto.ca)          4 Taddle Creek Road, TorontoComputing Coordinator                   Ontario, Canada.

Trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmerscrewed up the TIBs or didn't test their driver with the device in question.Well designed TIBs poll or loop at every point where delays of >16sec occur.This usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but somedevices can "hiccup" in the middle of blocks.  If this happens in the middleof a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a bytedepending on which direction the tranfer was going.  In anycase the SCSI Managerwill eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction becauseit is out of sync.  Actual data loss would only occur if the driver didn'tpay attention to the errors coming back.Note that this effect is not caused by anything actually on the SCSI Bus butrather by the transfer loops inside the SCSI Manager.  The problem occurs whenthe processor bus errors trying to access the SCSI chip when the next bytehasn't been clocked yet.  Also note that the Bus Error is dealt with by a buserror handler and doesn't crash the machine...Clinton BauderApple Computer

They do sell a cutout fortheir CD-ROM drive (of course), but that's of no use.I'm going to hack up the extra bezel I ordered to make a cutout for mytape drive, which is a standard 5.25" device.Good luck with your SyQuest.-Fred

 25Distribution: worldMessage-ID: <hurh-060493172214@phurh.fnal.gov>NNTP-Posting-Host: phurh.fnal.govHere's a question that may be simple enough to answer, but has stumpedmyself and a few others:What does an external RAM cache card do for you if you already have a largecache set (through control panel) in your SIMMs?EX:  I have a Mac IIci with 20 meg RAM, an external video card (so I don'trob my SIMM's), and the default Apple cache card (I believe this is 32K?). Say I have my cache set at 2 MEG, what good does a measly 32K do me on thecache card?  Could it actually slow things down by dividing the cachebetween the card and the SIMM's?  Or does it still speed things up byproviding a 'secondary staging' area for data normally passed directly intothe SIMM RAM cache?I'm confused because it seems like cache cards are so low in memory toreally do any good compared to what you can set yourself.  Yet, DaystarFastCache has numbers which show around a 30% performance boost on someoperations.  Are the chips on the cache card simply faster than most SIMMaccesses?Please help, I'm trying to find the optimum memory settings for the IIcisystem described in the EX above.--patrickhurh@fnal.fnal.gov

I tried it with another keyboard, usingthe same adb connector cable- and it worked with the other keyboard.The shift key on the Datadesk keyboard worked well otherwise. I checkedthe dipswitches and they are fine.  Try disabling your extensions and tellme if it works.             I am annoyed with Datadesk.  I sent them the keyboard in the mail forinspection/repair/replacement.  The technician on the phone said theyhave a 10-14 day turn around time- meaning you should receive theinspected/repaired keyboard in that time.  Well, they have had the          keyboard for over 3 weeks and I still have gotten very little infofrom them about it. It's annoying because it cost me $12 to send themthe keyboard and their technical support line is not toll free. tell meif you have a similar experience with them.-David Mirskymirsky@gnu.ai.mit.edu

I tried out a Proxima Ovation unit and likedit, but I needed a brighter projector (I used it with a 3M 920). It isalso too expensive for what you get, IMHO. Prices of active matrix panelsare rumoured to drop substantially sometime this year (something to dowith tarrifs being lifted I think). In Canadian dollars, the Proxima Ovation models ranged in price from about$5000 to $7000 and a good overhead projector about $1000 to $1500. Forthat kind of money, you can get a brighter image from a three beamprojector, but sacrifice portability.Oh yes, proper room lighting is extremely important, especially if youwant your audience to have enough light to read handouts and not have thatlight wash out your display at the front of the room.

It was the second coming of the Lisa. Italso predated the Mac Plus AND the 20Mb serial HD by quite a few months.For a short while it WAS the power users system.--- . DeLuxe. 1.26b #956s .

 20I'm considering adding a floptical drive to my current system.What I would like to know is which floptical drives are recommended fortheir quality and performance.My preference would be floptical drives capable of handling both 800k and1.4k floppies, but handling 800k floppies is not a necessity.So far, I only know a bit about the Iomega floptical and the Infinityfloptical drives.  Are there any comments/recommendations for either of these?Are there any other floptical drives that are worth looking into and wherecan they be purchased (i.e. which mail order places, etc).Thanks in advance.Please send replies directly to umsoroko@ccu.umanitoba.ca----Mike Sorokowski(umsoroko@ccu.umanitoba.ca)

(It's too slow.)Why would you dispose a channel if you are going to play moresounds soon? If you are trying to write a game, you shouldn'tbe using SndPlay.

I was doing continuous background sound withinterrupting sound effects on System 6.0 with the IM-Vdocumentation.You probably were cancelling your callback commands out ofyour channels, of course you didn't get called. In general, ifyou have problems with sounds working when you play one perchannel and then close the channel (with the relatedslowdown), but then when you play more than one you don'twork, then you are adding more than one synthesizer to achannel, possibly the same one multiple times. This might bebecause you are calling SndPlay on a preexisting channel witha sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer tothe channel first thing before it plays. Most sampled soundshave this command at the start of them. You need to reseditthe sound and remove that command, then when you create yourchannel, specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be thechannel's synth. Then you can use asynch sndplay's all youwant. You'll probably want to switch to BufferCmd's, since youare going to have to use SndDoCommand anyway to add callbacks.Now before you go ahead and tell me I am full of it, and thesound manager doesn't work for games, remember, Spectre usesit. And it works great. If Spectre can spare the CPU time, youcan too.One little disclaimer: There are some out there who say theSound Manager in the IIsi can't be made to work right. I'm notsure either way, but I know for sure that you can make yoursounds work 100% correctly on every other machine using theSound Manager.-Steve

I didn't realize that you were talking about an Appledivision other than AppleUS. AppleUS, being the main division, is theone that contains what most people feel are the correct names andconfigurations for the majority of Apple customers, and it is generallyassumed that you are talking about AppleUS when you just say Apple. Atleast that's how it has always been in this newsgroup. All other Appledivisions are, apparantly, free to change names and configurations ifthey feel like it. I know that Apple Canada does this kind of stuff allthe time. It's not a mistake, it's Apple Sweden giving a different nameto an Apple product other than what AppleUS calls it.-Hades
 15Here's another question by a hesitant Powerbook purchaser.I want to be able to run Mathematica and would like to hear some comments  from the gallery about this. How much slower does the program run on a  machine without an FPU (namely a PB160) versus a machine with an FPU  (namely a PB170).  What types of calculations get bogged down the most. I  primarily due moderately simple algebra, integrals which can be dealt with  analytically and plotting including 3-d plots. I don't do a lot of  numerical work. Would a PB160 with a lot of memory ( and the very nice  video port ) be sufficient or should I really try to get an FPU for this  type of work? Is a PB170 with 8Mb faster than a PB160 with 12 or 16Mb.All comments appreciated. Please respond by email:  ross@sbphy.physics.ucsb.edu

 28Hi there,I have a question regarding Quadras VRAM. I have tried to find info on thisbut I could not get precise answers.On one hand, we have a Quadra 950 with a 16" monitor, which is capable of32-bit color. How much VRAM does it have?On the other hand, we have a Quadra 800 with a 16" monitor, which is capableof 8-bit color only, so it must have 512 Ko of VRAM.I would like to take VRAM SIMMs for the 950 and put them in the 800 so thatboth machines have 16-bit color capability.Is it possible, and if yes, how many VRAM SIMMs should I take from the 950?From the documentation I have, the Quadra 800 must get 1 Mo VRAM to have16-bit color, is that correct?Bonus question: where do VRAM SIMMs hide? From the 950 documentation, theyseem to be *behind* the power supply. Do I really have to take off the powersupply to access the VRAM SIMMs?Thanks for your help!--Daniel Salber, User Interface Research Team, LGI-IMAG, Grenoble, France.salber@imag.fr

One of them has anEthernet Card, and is currently connected to a NeXT (don't laughI got it for the price of a Mac IIsi). The NeXT is connectedto the internet over SLIP running on a 9600 baud modem.Currently, we can telnet from the Mac w/ Ethernet to the NeXT,and then telnet out again to the rest of the world.What we want to know is if there is some sort of hardware thatwill route telnet sessions from the Localtalk Macs to the NeXTvia the Ethernet Mac. From what we have heard, AIR doesn't dothe trick.Software solutions would be good too, but my impression is thatthere aren't going to be any.Our immediate interest is to be able to get to the NeXT and telnetout again. The SLIP connection doesn't allow us to assign IP numbersto machines, so everyone shares that 1 number...oh well...thanks in advance.-- _______________________________________________________________Benjamin S.

 37Regarding the post for information about the Mac Portable and the Powerbook 100, here are a couple of the answers:(1) Does the Mac Portable support Appletalk? Yes(2) What CPU is in the Mac Portable? A low power version of the 68000 running at 15.87 Mhz.(3) Does the Mac Portable run system 7? Yes, although it does use up a lot of memory.(4) Is memory still availabe for the Portable? There are several vendors that still make RAM for the Portable. There are two options: Some vendors sell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable. Others sell memory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot. Either way, the most memory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes, depending on whether the Portable is Backlit or not. King Memory and Peripherials in Irvine California is the cheapest place I know of for Portable memory. 2MB - $140, 4 MB, $250, and 7 MB $415. I still see several ads in macuser that are selling 4 MB modules for $450. Wide variety in pricing here.(5) What is the internal HD? Its a Conner CP-3045 40 MB HD with an average access time of about 25 ms.(6) Is the screen better that the PB 100? Heavens yes! The PB 100 is a backlit PASSIVE matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move your head a few degrees left or right. The Portable has a backlit or non-backlit ACTIVE Matrix screen which I think is a joy to read.Other things to consider - Where to get the portable and how much to pay for it? A good supplier has been SelectTerm in Mass. They were willing to sell a 2MB Non-backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about $650. Or a 4 MB Backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about $900. The answer is call around for a good while or you'll pay too much.I'm still looking for an internal FAX modem for the portable? Anybody got one they want to sell? -- Good Luck, Gene Wright--  gene@theporch.raider.net (Gene Wright)theporch.raider.net  615/297-7951 The MacInteresteds of Nashville

 107Hello all!For few past days I've been fighting to get My NEC Multisync 3D(predecessor of 3FG) to work properly with the internal video of MacIIvi.With a VGA-adapter (as described in Dale Adams' posting about Quadravideo) it works, only some minor interferences occur, small enough notto prevent any action on screen to be visible & clear.But because the scanrates & stuff of 3D are well enough for emulatingApple 13" RGB, I first made an adapter, then got one fron the localdistributor of NEC.With both adapters I can get a picure, which looks excellent most ofthe time or every now and then.But with radical changes on screen (opening palettes, large windowsetc.) there are major interferences in sync. The picture either tiltssideways or scrables up totally. Even when it is clear, there are some"spiky" interferences on horizontal line alignment when accessingpull-downs etc.With the self-made adapter, almost identical to the VGA one, onlysense pins differ, it is sometimes impossible to even boot up with apicture clear enough to shut down from menu...With the adapter from NEC, everything is well most of the time, butsometimes the picture tilts badly sideways or the sync is completelylost. But not nearly as often as with the self-made one.I know, with self made adapters there can always be interference, butwith the one provided by NEC... where's the source of this interference?I'll give you the pinouts of the whole mess, and I hope that you can,at least someone (please try =) figure out what could be the best pinassignment for NEC 3D.I am going to make a completely new cable with maximum shieldings andisolations, as soon as someone figures out how the pins should bearranged, especially syncs and groundings.Yes, I have checked that the monitor is not defective, it worksperfectly well with all PC graphic adapters up to 1024x768 pixels andalso Atari 71Hz monochrome, which I am using now with it.Here are the pinouts & stuff:15 pin mini D-sub (NEC 3D)15 pin D-sub (Mac, at least Quadra)1  Red Video1  Red GND2  Green Video2  Red Video3  Blue Video3  Composite Sync4  GND4  Sense 05  GND5  Green Video6  Red GND6  Green GND7  Green GND7  Sense 18  Blue GND8  NC9  NC9  Blue Video10 GND10 Sense 211 GND11 C.Sync & V.Sync GND12 NC12 V.Sync13 H.Sync13 Blue GND14 V.Sync14 H.Sync GND15 NC15 H.SyncSHELL GNDSHELL GNDConnection suggested by Apple for VGA/SVGA, sense pins changed toemulate Apple 13" with Multisync (my self-made adapter)Multisync (15pin mini D-sub)Mac (15pin D-sub)    1  ---------------------- 2  2  ---------------------- 5  3  ---------------------- 9  6  ---------------------- 1  7  ---------------------- 6  8  ---------------------- 13  10 ---------------------- 14  13 ---------------------- 15  14 ---------------------- 12    4 (sense0) grounded to 11 (sync GND)Connection measured from an adapter to make NEC 3FG/4FG emulate Apple 13" (adapter provided by NEC representative)NEC (15 mini)   Mac (15)1   ----------------------- 22   ----------------------- 53   ----------------------- 94   ----------------------- SHELL GND, 1, 4, 6, 135   ----------------------- same as above6   ----------------------- same...7   ----------------------- same...8   ----------------------- same...10  ----------------------- same...11  ----------------------- same...13  ----------------------- 314    * Not Connected! *Well, I am waiting for your solutions...And thanks!--Jartsu

The only reasonto get an IIvx is if you really need the full-size Nubus slots. Keep in mind that the 610 supports all Apple monitors and has optional Ethernet.This lessens (but doesn't eliminate) the need for Nubus cards. And unlessyou're running FPU-intensive software, the 610 will blow the doors off theLCIII and the IIvx. The LCIII, on the other hand, is sufficient for mostpeople and has a great price.If you haven't guessed, I find halving the bus clock (the IIvx 32MHz uP vs.16MHz bus) a throughly bad thing and I hope Apple never does it again.-- ______________________________________________________________________________|Joe Finete                                                                   ||jfinete@cats.ucsc.edu                                                        |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cananyone give me a listing of all the models and tell me what I'm looking for,i.e. passive matrix vs. active, memory sizes, upgradeability, internal modems,disk size.  If you could provide some prices too that would help.  I'm notinformed enough on Powerbooks to know how well they operate.

This is pretty standard in portable machines, and thesame kinds of tricks could be played; spinning down disks, turning offscreens, reducing clock speed, etc.  The advantage of this over just turningthe thing off would be 1) you don't have to remember to do anything and 2)the machine is still available over the network.The tricky part might be in defining what constitutes inactivity.Certainly, you don't want to wake up from sleep mode just because somebodypinged you, but you do want to wake up (at least the CPU) if somebodylogs in via a telnet connection.I wouldn't worry too much about wasting electricity in the wintermonths; that energy is just getting turned into heat.  It may not be asefficient a way to heat a building as the central heating plant, but it'snot too bad.  In the summer though, it's a disaster.

My question is can I putit in a Performa 600 (68030 @ 32MHz)?  The Apple price is cheap at $78compared to ~$135 from mail order houses.  Any one know the answer to thisone?

According to the latest MacLeak, the drive has a 14.5 ms access time, 1.9 MB/s sustained throughput (these figuresare from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea ofperformance nonetheless). The drive was originally released for the PCand just recently was released for the Mac world (don't ask me what the differences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, accordingto a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production.I have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeakincluding PLI, MassMicro, ClubMac, and MacWarehouse's PowerUser. The PLIand MassMicro units are priced at just around $1000; the lesser name brandsare going for around $750 for an external drive. Cartridges which hold 105 MB sell for about $80 each. At these prices, the drives and cartridgesare cheaper and better performing than the 88MB drives.Cost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoullidrives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and morereliable.

They'lltreat you like an idiot and you won't get any answers (a personalopinion).The safest thing to do is match the SVGA monitor's scanning rates withApple's rates.  I don't know Apple's video scanning rates, but I use theMicron Xceed 30's rates, as they're a good approximation.About cables: you just have to go out to someplace like Fry's and get afew Mac-VGA cables and try them out.  I have a ViewSonic 5E (14") and Iuse an NEC adaptor.  Other monitors may use other adaptors.  I also havea Mac->832x624 adaptor that tricks System into thinking the monitor is anApple 16".

 60REPOST - DUE TO NET PROBLEMSHi,   I have problems with the FDHD on a IICX that EKG reports is ROMrevision 376. I had reports that this Mac was having trouble formatting disks and by the time I got to it, the FDHD just wouldnot respond although all other functions were fine.I checked the voltages on the DB19 external drive connector and pin6 showed no volts with 7 and 8 giving 25volts unloaded. The power supply is an Astec and I sent it away for repair.With the power supply reinstalled, I now get the following error:With the internal FDHD connected, the Mac boots fine but on completionof boot cycle an alert displays "The disk is unreadable - do youwant to eject it?". For every combination of response, the alert reappears within approx 2 seconds and this error is continuous. TheFDHD does spin but there is no head seeking and the FDHD is incapableof ejecting the disk. This error sequence occurs regardless of whetherthere is a floppy in the drive or not. Pin 6 on the DB19 external connector shows 1.2V, pins 7 and 8 show 10.75V.With the internal FDHD disconnected, the Mac boots fine and works great (MacEKG reports no errors). The DB19 external connector now showsno voltage on pin 6 but pins 7 and 8 show 10.75V.Now, the internal FDHD may be fubar, but I have an apple 800K externaldrive that gives exactly the same symptoms as the internal drive whenconnected to either the external DB19 or the internal connector at J16(after suitable surgery to the external drive). The voltages at J16 (with the internal FDHD disconnected) are as follows:PINVoltsPINVolts1-253-455-657-8-9-10511-12-1310.751451510.751651710.7518-1910.75205This machine has a SWIM which I don't think EKG tests. I have tested alldiodes and pica fuses and can find no problems. Does anybody have anyideas ?                        Best wishes,                          Woody.

The answer ot this question is an unqualified yes.  You can use anyold vga/svga monitor with a centris.  You do need an adaptor (I use aMac vga-q from james engineering (510) 525-7350) to run between the twomachines.  THe adaptor I have mentioned will convert a centris to athree row vga/svga 25(?) pin adaptor for your monitor.    NOW, the special interest disclaimer. The above answer is correct for using a vga monitor at 600x400resolution.  IF your monitor will sync to 56Khz horizontal the aboveadaptor will allow you to choose 800x600 resolution (I prefer this on my1604s).THen You have the question of matching adaptors and sync rates.  I wouldadvocate calling James engineering because they seem to have a clue.  Asto the comment by the person who said don't bother calling Apple becausethey will treat you like an idiot this is totally untrue.    APPLE WILL TREAT YOU LIKE A F**KING ASSANINE IDIOT FOR EVENCONSIDERING GOING THIRD PARTY AND IF YOU WANT THIS TREATMENT WANTS YOUTO PAY FOR THEIR THECH SUPPORT LINE (the supposedly compitantly one) ANDTHEN STILL HAS NO FU***** CLUE.personal experience.  also the tech suppport for the vga monitor makersdoesn't see to extend to Macs (Sony, Magnavox).  In addition to this tofind out the info you will have to call dealers unless you can find thesync rates elsewhere as ads like Hardware that fits(*&^%&%^%$$(&**&^(%&%^$!) that rate monitor resolutions give the mostfavorable rating (which usually means you can get this if you use aspecialized application video card).(i.e. "well you can get a resolution1168x832 on this $5,  9" "super smelly sock" monitor that will let youdisplay TWO FULL PAGES side by side.  All you need is our reasonablypriced "oder eater" video board for $27,000 and it will give you anultra fast horizontal sync rate of SIX fast kilohertz and three Khzvertical.")Note:  with the sony 1604 at least on the centris 610 built in videoboard using an 832x624 adaptor, there is a boarder of an inch + to thesides of the image after adjusting the horizontal width as favorably aspossible.  Using a 800x600 adaptor this can be reduced to about half aninch.                                                                    -A.

The Duo is 32-bit through-out.Thanks for the enlightening post.  Is there a Technical Note on this?The desktop machine I was referring to was actually not a Mac,but rather, any of various workstations that use the68030@25MHz, such as old Suns or old NeXTs.  I used to own a NeXT68030 cube.   But I will try rebooting without extensions to see what kind ofa speed difference I get with my powerbook Duo. I did notice anextreme slowdown to unusability with a Mac Plus afterinstalling system 7 on it.  Why does the OS suck up so much CPUpower? Also, you're right--software does make a HUGE difference.  Ihave the misfortune of using MS-Works on my Duo.  When editingrelatively small (40K) files, cut or copy takes severalseconds, often more than 6 seconds!!  This happens with powercycling turned off.  As usual, MS software is maggot-infestedfeces. I'm getting Nisus to replace it for my text editing.-Avery

This past summer I upgraded (increased) the memory ina powerbook and a ci.   When I called to place the order for the PB RAM, I wastold by the sales person that they would give me a $50 rebate if I would returnthe original RAM (which was also TechWorks RAM.)  I followed the instructions forreturning the old RAM, expecting to see a credit on my VISA within a few weeks.Well, months went by, and no credit.  After many calls (almost none of which wereever returned - arghhh) I finally found someone who told me "Why we neverreceived your old chips."  I then explained I the procedure that I hadfollowed to return them, to which the person replied "You mean you sent themUS Mail?" (which I had, per the original sales person's instructions.)  I wastold that they their loss of US mail shipments is not uncommon (come on) and thatI should have sent the stuff via FedEx, etc.  I reasoned that I had done exactlywhat I had been told to, but they would not budge, the people I spoke with wereabsolutely no help.  I sent letters, copies of the original receipts, attemptedto trace the package through the US mail, made *many* more phone calls toTechWorks, all to no avail (I wouldn't give-up because I was so disgusted.)Sales/support people, supervisors, there was nothing I could do to pursuade themto "make it right."I finally (in total disgust) wrote a letter to my credit card company, askingthem to investigate the problem.   Three weeks later, the credit miraculouslyappeared on my statement.  I have not (in recent memory) been so disgusted withthe service that I received from a company.  In all fairness, they had no way ofknowing that was not trying to rip them off, but I went to *such* great lengthsto prove to them that this really happened.  Oh well, c'est la vie.  I will neverbuy another product from them again.(There - had to get that off my chest!)

 18I just recently bought a 4 MB ram card for my original mac portable (backlit) and have since had some bizarre crashes. It happens when I put the machine to sleep and wake the machine up. sometimes it will just freeze the cursor and lock the machine up forcing me to push the reset switch. Other times it will give me the usual bomb box with the error message of "Co processor not installed". I know one solution is NOT to put the machine to sleep, but does anyone have any ideas on what could be causing this or better yet what might fix it? The memory card is Psuedostatic ram and goes into the PDS Slot. That probably figures into the problem. the manufacturer is King Memory (Not kingston) from irvine, CA. They say the problem is in my machine. Any Ideas? -- Gene Wright.--     gene@jackatak.raider.net (Gene Wright)------------jackatak.raider.net   (615) 377-5980 ------------

I can't imagine that it would be cheaper to build an 8 MB SIMM using 1 Mb DRAMs as the 4 Mb parts reached (and exceeded) bit for bit price parity with the 1 Mb parts some time ago.  It's probably possible to build a single-bank 8 MB SIMM using 4 Mb parts - this could cause problems in a Q800.  I'm not sure why you'd want to do this, though, as a dual-bank 8 MB SIMM would be cheaper to build than a single-bank composite one.- Dale Adams
 25EC>It was called the Mac XL when Sculley came on board. I bought one ata close-out place after the Mac Plus and the awesome 20-meg serial harddrive were introduced. To pacify people who bought the XL and only foundit was discontinued within a year, Apple sent people like I a lettersaying for $1500 and the XL, they would give me a 1-meg Mac Plus withthe HD20.The Lisa was originally introduced in 1980 or '81, I forget now, andsold for $9995 with 2 400k floppy drives and 1Mb memory. It didn't dotoo well. <grin>Before becoming the Mac XL it was called a Lisa 2/10. It had a built in10meg HD by this time and was expandable to 2Mb RAM although that's notwhat the 2 in 2/10 stood for. It was the second coming of the Lisa. Italso predated the Mac Plus AND the 20Mb serial HD by quite a few months.For a short while it WAS the power users system.--- . DeLuxe. 1.26b #956s .

 51Does anyone know who makes a cable or adapter that is wired according toApple's specs that forces the external output on LC's and the Powerbook's160/180 and Duo 230 into a true VGA style output signal? The NEC Adapter doesnot do this since their monitors are multisync they just route the signal intothe correct pinout but do not switch the Macs output into VGA mode.Do I have to make one of these or does someone already have one made-up??The following is the Apple spec for the LC cpu VGA Cable adapter. I'm assumingthat the Powerbooks/Duos will work with the same adapter(?);Macintosh LC to VGA The Macintosh LC can supply a 640 x 480, VGA timed signal for use with VGAmonitors by using an adapter cable.  The standard Macintosh LC supports VGA to16 colors, and with the optional 512K VRAM SIMM, the VGA monitor is supportedto 256 colors. Note:     The Macintosh LC supplies signals capable of driving TTL level          inputs.  However, some low impedance input VGA monitors do not work          with the Macintosh LC. To connect a Macintosh LC to a VGA monitor, you need to make an adapter cablefrom the Macintosh LC video connector to the VGA monitor.  Following is thepinout description for the adapter cable: Macintosh LC        VGAVideo Connector     Pin     Signal Name---------------     ----    -----------1                   6       Red ground2                   1       Red video signal5                   2       Green video signal6                   7       Green ground9                   3       Blue video signal13                  8       Blue ground15                  13      /HSYNC12                  14      /VSYNC14                  10      HSYNC ground7,10                nc      SENSE1 & SENSE2 tied together VGA monitors are identified by shorting pin 7 to pin 10 on the Macintosh LCvideo connector.

 17I remember reading a thread a few days ago that mentioned removing an externalsyquest drive from its case and dropping it in the internal drive of a Centris.. . I was going to do that with my 610, but had a couple of questions.  MyPLI 80M syquest drive has a wire from the drive to an id# switch on theoutside of the case.  Where do I connect this switch??  Can the computer just"tell" with internal drives?  I noticed that the drive will lay over part of the motherboard (Ididn't look closely, but I seem to recall it laying over the ram that'ssoldered onto the motherboard?  Would that cause problems?One last question!  Is there anywhere to order a faceplate cover?  the drive's front panel is smaller than the space left in the case (thedrive's panel is the same size as the spotsBM clone's cases).  Should I justcut a hole in the plastic panel that is currently holding tmpty place?Ans are welcomed!  Thanks!Keith MoffattKMOFFATT@VAX2.CSTP.UMKC.EDU

The Presenter offers a variety of video-out options, including NTSC, RGB and SVGA. It also has sound out, floppy drive portand a power port. Unfortunately no SCSI port and it blocks the serial port.  The DeskNet has the standard ports plus built-in EtherNet. Alas, none ofthese have an FPU.  In the future, RasterOps is putting out a mini-dock, but the name escapesme now. It is supposed to support 16-bit color and "Quadra" comparablevideo speed. No idea if it has an FPU.  Hope this helps...Beth Corbo

Compliers maybe written to allow programs to take consitant advantage of the 68040's PCLK in the future.  As it is now, studies such as one in a Byte article {which showed 040/25 ~486/50 and roughly ~486dx2/50} are very dependent on the machine, OS, and programs tested and as such are not representative of general performance.*#Motorola claims (PC Week 09/07/92; 09/14/92).As the PowerPCs are to be in both IBM and Mac machines I have listed them separately to eliminate redundancy.

These chips may flounder against the cheaper (PC Week 3/08/93; 4/12/93; PC Mag 4/27/93:110), earlier released (PC Week 12/7/92; MacWeek 12/14/92; PC Week 2/08/93), less leat producing {160 degrees F for Pentium(PC Mag 4/27/93:118)}, and partly ported to PowerPC chips.} PowerPC   = PowerPC {This CPU line is planned to run programs from DOS, Windows 3.x, OS/2 and Mac OS on top of PowerOpen-A/UX 4.0 [UNIX] and later Pink [Taligent OS] by using emulators or, if necessary, the OSes themselves in a 'shell' a.k. how SoftPC or OS/2 does DOS.}Hardware {In an effort to remove the 'reconfiguring the system almost every time you add something' requirement for add-in cards, drivers, video, and operating systems in the IBM world, Intel, Microsoft and 12 other hardware and software developers are working out 'plug and play' standards (PC Week 03/08/93).}Color Support/Display Mac: 30.24 MHz Pixel Clock standard.  All present Macs support the use of 32-bit color through 32-bit color QuickDraw in ROM.  32-bit color QuickDraw allows an almost transparent capability to display and edit X-bit images in Y-bit color and retain ALL the colors of Y-bit color [Where X and Y independently are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32] regardless of monitor resolution {63 dpi [12" color] to 94 dpi [PaletteBook]} or monitor type {including autosynchronous VGA, MCGA and SVGA monitors with ranges including 66.7 hz vertically and 35 kHz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor (MacUser Aug 1992: 158-176).  Older machines that supported color {SE/30, II, IIX, and IIcx} had only 8-bit color in ROM and needed a software patch to use 32-bit color (MacUser Special 1993:28-29).  To keep costs down and speed up most Macs have only 8 or 16 bit display capability built-in, but most of those can be expanded to display 24-bit color.    Presently QuickDraw is optimized for 72 dpi display; QuickDraw QX will change this.In addition, QuickDraw allows, in Macs with a NuBus slot, more then one monitor to be used in any combination, from two monitors showing the same thing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree of overlap of the pictures.VRAM: Video RAM.  Standard for present non-PowerBook Mac's handling of  built-in video {from a 32-bit color palette}. VRAM provided runs a 8-bit color 640x480 display; expandable to 16-bit color or a 8-bit 832x624 display. Sound output:  Standard in all Macs since the 128K.  Stereo sound became  standard with the SE/30.IBM:  Even though PCs have ROM BIOS definitions of how the operating system interacts with the video hardware (Nan Zou), the use of drivers bypassing BIOS, video hareware inconsitancies {see Super VGA below} and nonstanderzationof clone BIOS have left resolution of video display hardware, OS and program interaction up to the OS and video hardware in question (Faisal Nameer Jawdat). In addition, IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a standard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is actually present (Matt Healy) nor a standardized screen-drawing toolbox {like Mac's QD}. As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes, especially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly {At present things are so dependent on the interaction of the program, OS, print driver and monitor card that editing 32-bit pictures regardless of color mode, OS, and monitor type/card combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with an IBM.  For example, one cannot edit a 32-bit color picture done on a OS/2 486 with a SVGA monitor on a 386 with VGA {18-bit color palette} and DOS 5.0 and still have ALL the colors one started out with}.Later IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators, faster processors, and modular upgradeability and may have built-in sound cards, CD ROM, and Ethernet (PC Week 12/14/92).  MDA: Monocrome Display Adapter original character-mapped video mode, no graphics, 80x25 text.CGA: Color Graphics Array 320x200 4 colors or 640x200 b/w, 16 color palette, bad for the eyes.EGA:  Enhanced Graphics Array 640x350 16 colors from 64 color palette [and some lower res]; some versions  could run at 256 colors, bearable on the eyes.VGA:  Video Graphics Array* 320x200 at 256 colors, 640x480 at 16 colors, and some others, these two are  the most commonly used.  All modes have a 256K CLUT, from a  18 to 24-bit {IBM} or a 32-bit {Mac} color palette.  25.175 MHz Pixel Clock (Mel Martinez).  Monitors use analog input, incompatible with TTL signals from EGA/CGA etc. MCGA:  Multi-Color Graphics Array* subset of VGA that provides all the features of MDA & CGA, but lacks some EGA  and VGA modes, like VGA 640x480x16 (Dictionary of Computer Terms-DCT).   Common on the initial PS/1 implementation from IBM and some PS/2 Models.SVGA:  Super VGA* This is not a standard in the way the others were, but instead was a 'catch  all' category for a group of video cards.  As such, with each manufacturer  using their own implementation scheme, SVGA was chaos with people debating as to what is SVGA and what is not.  In an effort to make SVGA more of a  standard VESA was established and is used in the newer units, but things are still a mess.  Video is either 512K [~1990] or 1M [today], resolution of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common, newer ones [since  1990] have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC, giving 15-bit 32,768 colors at 800x600,  some of the very newer ones [~6/92] can do 24 bits per pixel [usually  at 640x480].  Speedwise, too much variation, some very slow [Western Digital  Paradise based, for example], some very fast [S3 86C911 based, for example],  some are so-so [like Tseng ET4000, a very popular chipset].  Some limiting  factors overcome by 40MHz VL Bus & 386's linear address mapping were:  8.33 MHz ISA bus, AT architecture where the CPU looks at the card through a  64K "window", etc.Other non-SVGA standards: 8514/a: IBM's own standard, interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions  like linedraw, polygon fill, etc. in hardware. Some clone implementations  from ATI are the fastest video available today, though some clone models do  not have interlacing. TMS34010/34020: high end graphics co-processors, usually >$1000, some do 24-bit, speeds up vector-oriented graphics like CAD.XGA:  eXtended Graphics Array newer and faster than 8514/a, only available for MCA bus-based PS/2s, clones  are coming out soon.  Emulates VGA, EGA, and CGA (DCT).  Max resolution at  1024x768x8b, same as 8514/a, also some 16 bpp modes.XGA-2 Accelerates graphics functions up to 20 times faster than standard VGA in Windows and OS/2, including line draws, bit and pixel-block transfers, area fills, masking and X/Y addressing. Has an intelligent way to detect and co- exist with other XGA-2 cards, so multiple desktops like on the Mac may not be  far away.  Since this is an architecture, its resolution and color depth  isn't fixed {IBM implements only 16-bit [65,536] color, while other  companies can have 24-bit color through IBM technical licenses}. Refresh  rates up to 75 Hz, ensures flicker free, rock solid images to reduce visual  discomfort, and is VGA compatible. Up to 1280x1024 on OS/2.*some monitor types usable by Mac-See Mac section above for specific details.ExpansionBoth Mac & IBMSCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM. Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card  expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.   Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal  terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port  {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the  end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave} and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  Difference is due to SCSI-1 software drivers.  "Fast SCSI-1" is a misname for 8-bit SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode {see SCSI-2 for details}.SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully SCSI-1 compliant and 8-bit SCSI-2 tends to be implemented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in   hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2 do.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 can use SCSI-1 software drivers and hardware at 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds and as such is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called "fast SCSI-1".  16-bit fast SCSI-2 requires a SCSI-2 software driver and SCSI-2 electronics but can still use the SCSI-1 ports.  Wide 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require a different SCSI port, electronics, and software driver from SCSI-1 {Which makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}.Mac SCSI: asynchronous SCSI-1 built-in standard since the Plus.  Even though  Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers, the OS SCSI Manager needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI interfaces.  As a result present SCSI-2 Macs use 8-bit SCSI-2 as a fast  asynchronous SCSI-1.  Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI-2 controller chip built-in (Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1))  though they lack some other parts of the hardware, like the wide SCSI-2 port  interface.  Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI-2, older NuBus  Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU.  Rumor-some Cyclone Macs {June} will come with a wide & fast SCSI-2 port standard  and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager.IBM SCSI:  SCSI-1 is not too wide spread yet, generally not bundled with  systems, except as add-on {EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable}. Like the Mac, 8-bit SCSI-2 is used as a very fast SCSI-1 by most controllers out there.  Unlike the Mac, IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI.MacMemory expansion: with a few exceptions the Mac has used non-parity 30-pin  8-bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus.  While 32-pin 9-bit parity SIMMs could be used in these Macs, only special IIcis could make use of the parity  feature {By convension both SIMM types are called 32-pin SIMMs}.  The IIfx  used 64-pin parity SIMMs.  The LC III, C610/650 and Q800 all use a new  72-pin SIMM that is accessable by 32-bits at a time and is used in IBMs. The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every memory location; if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is. Since Macs made before Feb 15, 1993 managed memory baced on data path, SIMMs  had to be installed in pairs {16-bit} or in sets of 4 {32-bit}.  The Centris  650 and Quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that  allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time.  If the SIMMs are the same  size are used then the memory is 'interleaved' across the two SIMMs resulting  in a 10-15% performance boost on RAM access (MacWorld Apr 93: 108-109).Printers, ADBs, and modems: built-in interfaces standard.Monitor interface and sound input: built-in on most present macs. PDS: Available in SE & all present non-Powerbook Macs. 16-bit {SE,  Portable, LC, LC II, Classic line} and 32-bit.  Operates at CPU's MHz.   Maximum through put: data path in bytes*CPU's MHz {Q700/900 & C650:  4 * 25Mhz = 100MB/s; Q800 & Q950: 4 * 33Mhz = 132MB/s}. Standardized with the LC and 040 bus designs.  With an adapter one NuBus card can be used in  IIsi and C610.  Problem: some cards have timing dependency which slows  through put down.NuBus Mac II: 32-bit, 10 MHz bus clock, 1-to-1 transaction/bus cycle ratio, and contiguous, hand-shake transactions at ~10-20MB/s; theoretical peak: 40MB/s.  Built-in on all Modular Macs except the LC series, C610, and  Performa 400.  The SE/30 could be adapted to use this and there was even a  Mac Plus SCSI NuBus.  Supports every possible expansion from CPU to Ethernet  to DMA.NuBus 90: NuBus Mac II back compatable. 20MHz bus clock, avg throughput: ~30MB/s; burst mode: 80MB/s.  Future card designs will be 7" instead of the  old 12".QuickRing:  A peer-to-peer bus used in parallel with NuBus 90.  Apple's  VLBus - "Architecture is identical to that of VLBus" (Byte 10/92:128). Burst mode: 350MB/s (Byte 10/92:128). In development.CPU expansion: handled either through the PDS or the NuBus.  Unlike PDS,   Nubus CPU cards {example-Radius Rocket} allow use of multiple processors at  the same time.  This is like having two or more Macs in the same box able to  dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved {Each  NuBus card needs its own memory but most NuBus cards of this type come with  8MB RAM SIMMs on the card standard}.IBMMemory expansion:  parity SIMMs, non-parity SIMMs {some newer models do a Mac-like SIMM memory check}, or a dozen or so different types of memory boards.HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: MFM:  Modified Frequency Modulation, RLL:  Run Length Limited only used with smaller [ 60mb] hard drives.IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics  Asynchronous {~5MB/s max} and synchronous {8.3MB/s max} transfer. currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized  drives. Can have more than one hard drive. ESDI:  Enhanced Small Device Interface ~1.25MB/s throughput. generally considered better interface than SCSI-1 in many ways but not common enough for practical consideration.  Outside of hard drives, device choices are very limited compared to SCSI-1. BUS interfaces{New 'plug and play' ISA and EISA compatable cards may have problems working with old cards (InfoWorld; PC Week 03/08/93; Vaporware 4/93).}ISA 8 & 16-bit interfaces common. Has 24-bit data path limit {which produces a 16MB limit for which there are software workarounds} (PC Mag 4/27/93:105). 1.5 MB/s (Byte 3/93:132).  Uses edge-triggered interrupts, can't share them, hence comes the IRQ conflict.  Limited busmastering capabilities, some cards aren't bandwidth limited {COM  ports, LPT ports, game ports, MIDI card, etc.} while others are {video and disk controllers}.  Dominant factor, but it's showing its age.  Most ISA motherboard designs are 16-bit (PC World Feb 1993: 144-5)}.  MCA {Micro Channel} IBM's 16 and 32-bit bus; "allows use of more than one CPU in a computer"  (DCT) and anything can talk to anything, as fast as the two components  involved can handle it. Never took off because it was incompatible with ISA  and EISA.  Planned to be bus interface of IBM PowerPC 601 (Carl Jabido).EISA {NuBus Mac II is closest Mac equivalent} 32-bit, 8.33 MHz, burst mode: 33MB/s.  It also has the ability to  self-configure cards like MCA and allows multiple bus masters, sharable  interrupt and DMA channels and multiple CPU use.VESA Local Bus: VLB {Sometimes mistakenly refereed to as PDS} Local Bus standard. Runs at CPU clock rate,  Burst modes: ~130 MB/s{32-bit} 250 MB/s{64-bit} (Byte 10/92:128).  Limited to three slots but allows bus  mastering and will coexist with either ISA or EISA. Consitered ideal for  video and disk I/O.  DELL has filled a claim that this violates one of their patents (Mel Martinez).QuickRing: Apple's faster {350 MB/s burst} version of VLB architecture (Byte 10/92:132).  Might show up in some IBM and PowerPC machines (Byte 10/92:132-133). In development.PCI Intel's version of Local Bus that is intended to totally replace  ISA/EISA/MCA.  In development.OSes {assumes full installation [print drivers, fonts, Multifinder, etc.]and multiple application use.}Mac512K to 1MB of OS and hardware commands have been put into ROM.  This allows Apple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the Mac OS {QuickDraw, menu commands, print, mouse, SCSI & sound drivers, etc} in ROM, which require clone makers to use the ROM chip or read ROM on to disks {Which requires access to the proper Mac since different Macs have slightly different ROM chips; Plus vs Classic for example.}  With key hooks for the OS support interface in ROM, programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk OS has the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and therefore can write smaller programs.  This also allows Apple greater control over hardware-software standards and that the disk OS can be smaller and, with some of the tookbox command code in ROM, with lower RAM requirements then a totally disk based OS.  Macs use Masked ROM which is as fast as DRAM (Jon Wtte).6.0.7: Single program usage base requirements: 1 MB and DD floppy,  cooperatively-multitasking base requirements: 2MB and HD floppy.   Features a GUI, cooperative-multitasker [MultiFinder], standard program  interface, & standard stereo sound support [snd]. Network receiving part of  AppleShare software is bundled with the OS. Has a 8MB RAM barrier and is a  24-bit OS. Some third party products allow 14MB of Virtual Memory as long as  real RAM is below 8MB.6.0.8: 6.0.7 with 7.0.0 print drivers.6.0.8L:  System 6 for some Macs that require System 7.0.X.7.0.X: Base requirements: 2MB, 40MB Hard Drive, and 68000; De-facto standard  to run all features well: 4MB, 80MB Hard Drive, and 68030 {lowest present  non-portable Mac configuration}.  Using up to 10.08MB {This is EVERYTHING on system disks} of hard disk space this has 6.0.7 features plus program linking  within and between computers [IAC], built-in server capabilities {Filesharing  can be used by older OSes using AppleShare Client software and can be  accessed by 10 macs max; 4-5 is more speed practical, IAC requires 7.X},  Virtual Memory in machines with MMU{1.6 times real RAM for least noticeable  IIsi speed degradation}, drag and drop, QuickTime & built-in TrueType  support.  Supports sound input [AIFF and snd formats] for most present  machines.  Can access up to 1GB of true RAM and 4GB of virtual memory and is  both a 24 and 32-bit OS.  To use real RAM beyond 8MB it must be in 32-bit  mode and on older machines requires the 'Mode 32' extension.  Apple's last  'free' OS.7.1.0: 7.0.1 with WorldScript support, speedier, and less RAM usage than  7.0.dot (MacWeek 8/24/92; 9/14/92; PC Week 9/7/92). To run in 32-bit mode  on older machines it requires the 'Mode 32' or '32-Bit Enabler' extension.  Marks the start of Apple saling its Mac OS instead of allowing free upgrades {Bundled with new machines, $49 for 7.0.X upgrades, $99 otherwise}. [The installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system  fonts from the previous system inside the system file.  This can eat up any  RAM benefits and cause other problems.  Apple itself recommends removing all  fonts from the system file.]A/UX 3.0 [UNIX]: Needs 8MB RAM {12-20MB suggested}, 160MB hard drive, and  a 68030 or 68040 equivalent to run.  This 32-bit preemptive multitasking OS  is large due to being UNIX and needing translators between it and the Mac  ROMs.  Price: $709.Note: sound output was supported in OSes 3.2 to 6.0.5 by many formats including the following:  snd, WAVE, ASND, FSSD, QSSN, SMSD, SOUN, dc2d, and DCFL.  In 6.0.7 the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards 'snd' and AIFF which causes some playback problems for the old formats, though most still play.IBM Machiness have little GUI code, data, and hooks present in hardware for programmers to work with, so most of the coding must be provided in the OS.  Since hard disks were slow the disk OS code is read into RAM.  In addition, what little ROM code there is also read into RAM {a process called Shadow ROM}  This results in faster implementation since RAM is faster then PROMS or EPROMS.  Having most of the OS code on disk has the advantage of being able to better optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which is harder with a ROM based system due to the 'patches' needed.  In addition it reduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware support is needed.Side note:  The FTC charged that MicroSoft formed a OS trust by not providing all feature documentation for its OSes to developers outside MS and designing its Windows and DOS apps to fail under OS/2 ("Undocumented Windows") and "There is deliberate code in [Windows] NT Beta which causes the install to abort if OS/2 Boot Manager is present" (Gregory Hicks, Info-IBMPC Digest V92 #201).  Due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the FTC judicial council for action against Microsoft was a tie which resulted in no action.  Rumors-the FTC will presue the matter, likely to the point of choosing a new member or whole new council.  In addition the government has turned down Microsoft's copyright of "Windows" which would allow it to charge a fee for developers using their hooks (PC Week 03/08/93).MicroSoft OSesDOS 5.0: Has a 640K barrier with its own memory manager, a 1 MB barrier  with third party memory managers.  This 16-bit OS requires that each program  must provide its own print drivers and be 16-bit {Programs need to be DOS  Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) compliant and running on a 386dx [32-bit  Protected Mode] to break these barriers}.  Contains the GUI shell present in DOS 4.0.DOS 6.0: DOS 5.0 with the added features of a built-in file compresion, disk  defragmenter, debugger for the CONFIG.SYS file. It needs a $80 module for  networking {Cost: $50 through 5/93, after that $129.99}  (Byte April 1993:44-46).DOS 7.0: 32-bit DOS. In development (PC Week 04/05/93).Window 3.0: Runs on top of DOS.  Breaks 640K and 1M barriers but still has to  deal with DOS file structure.  Base requirements: 1MB, floppy and 286; to run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx and fast display adapter {> 8-bit}.  Has the equivalent of Mac's QD called Windows GDI [Graphics Device Interface]. This does not have a consistent application interface {Like early Mac programs  (1984-1985)} nor a very large program base {compared to DOS} and still tends to slow the machine down (Info-IBMPC Digest V92 #186) with speed is more dependent on the display adapter then on the CPU (Bill Coleman). Window programs tend to be disk and memory hogs compared to their DOS counterparts (Byte April 1993:98-108).Window 3.1: A faster version of Window 3.0 with better memory managment. Base  requirements 1 MB, hard drive and a 286 ;to run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx.  Apple plans to release its print drivers for this (PC Week 12/28/92).Windows for Workgroups:  To run well: 4MB RAM and 386dx (PC World Feb/93:160).   Intermediary between Win 3.1 and Windows NT.  It is basically Windows 3.1  with built-in peer to peer networking support.Windows NT:  Beta release takes about 50MB of disk space [including the  swap file], and 12MB RAM {Betas are notorious for RAM usage especially in  the interaction between debuging code and program compliers, hence the  reports of 24MB requirements}.  Released version supposed to need 8MB RAM  but, Gates himself now recommends 16MB RAM (PC Week 04/15/92). This 32-bit OS has Protected mode multitasking, multithreading, symmetric  multiprocessing, a recoverable file system, and 32-bit GDI.  Has built in networking that is OSF DCE compliant and can handle up to 4GB of RAM.  Even though some people see a July 4 release date (InfoWorld Nov 16/92), rumor is that the final version will not be available before Oct 1993 (InfoWorld May 25/92; July 6/92; Vaporware 07/92; 08/92) or 4th quarter 1993 (PC Week 09/28/92). Windows upgrades will be $295, otherwise $495 (PC Week 04/15/92; 03/15/93).Other OSesPC-DOS 6.0: IBM's version of DOS 6.0.  It runs Windows much faster then DOS  6.0 due to faster file I/O and video handling (InfoWorld Feb 1, 93).DR DOS 6.0: same as DOS 5.0 with some extras {like built-in data compression}  and memory management enhancements. Still has 640K/1MB barrier.  A later  version {Novell DOS} of this may use a version of the Mac finder and Apple  file management system (PC Week 12/14/92; InfoWorld Dec 14/92).OS/2 2.0: Unix like features and unix like requirements; 8-16MB RAM, 60MB {uses 17-33MB} hard drive, and 386dx CPU. This 32-bit multithreaded,  multitasking OS can address up to 4GB of RAM but has to use a fast swap file  to use more than 16 MB RAM on ISA systems using DMA {Direct Memory Access}.  IBM plans to use Taligent's OOPS in future versions of this  (InfoWorld Oct 26/92).AIX:  IBM's UNIX system, planned to be a subset of PowerOpen and Taligent OS.NeXTStep: GUI UNIX to provide NeXT features on IBM machines.  Beta out, final  version to be out by May 25, 1993.Solaris OS for x86: a SunSoft port.  A 32-bit OS with symmetric  multiprocessing and multithreading, built-in networking capabilities with  tools to allow remote configuring and adminstration features, and  communication package.  Client: $795,  50 users server: $1,995, 1000s users server: $5,995.  Developer kits-software: $495, hardware: $195.Mac 7.1 [working name: Star Trek]:  Apple had System 7.0 running off Intel  Chips and is looking at making a 7.1 version available for IBM  (ComputerWorld Nov 2/92; MacWeek 03/22/93). At present this is planned to run  on top of Novell's DR DOS, require a 486 or equivalent to run and that apps  will need to be recompiled (MacWeek 03/22/93).  Viewed as Novell's answer to  Windows NT.  The complexity of PC hardware set ups is one reason for slow  progress {This seems to Apple/IBM's way of leading to the PowerPC line out in  late 1993/early 1994 and Pink OS in late 1994-early 1995.}PowerPCRumor-IBM will build its PowerPC 601 by late 1993 (InfoWorld June 8 & 15, 92; MacWeek 7/13/92; PC Week 3/15/93).  It will have MicroChannel bus and XGA video (Carl B Jabido), and will run native version AIX and Mac apps (PC Week 3/15/93); there have been no comments on compatablity of DOS or Windows apps.Apple's PowerPC 601 machine {Tesseract} is planned to be out Jan 24, 1994 and to have MC98601/50 MHz, 4/8MB RAM, a 2.8-Mbyte floppy drive and expected to sale near LC line prices {~$2000, down from projections of ~$3000 (MacUser 9/92:146)}(MacWeek 3/22/93).PowerOpen [A/UX 4.0]: A 32-bit preemtive multitasking OS planned to run on PowerPCs and 68030/40 Macs (MacWeek 7/13/92).  Intel compatibility uncertain (See Mac 7.1 above).  Planned base requirements:  68030, 8MB RAM, 80MB hard drive (MacWeek 4/19/93). Rumor-ahead of schedule; COULD be out by mid 1993. Rumor-this could be the OS for IBM's PowerPC 601 which is due by late 1993.Pink [Taligent OS]: Expecting delivery in 1994 (Wall Street Journal 1/12/92)  and may have some parts shipping in OS/2 and AIX in 1993 and Mac OS and  PowerOpen with the PowerPCs (MacWeek 01/25/93).Windows NT: Possible port (MacWeek 04/05/93).  See IBM OS section for details.Solaris OS: Version of this Sun Microsystems Inc UNIX OS to run on the Power PCs in 1994 (MacWeek 04/05/93).  One of the few OSes to directly state  that it will run Windows/DOS programs.  IBM OS section for detailsNeXTStep: possible port see IBM OS section for details.OS Number Crunching (Mel Park)Mac Arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment {SANE or Standard Apple Numerics Environment}. Floating point numbers are 96 bits long when an FPU is present and 80 bits otherwise. Exceptions, such as dividing by zero or taking the square root of a negative number, do not cause an abort but are handled in a logically consistent manner. 1/0 produces the internal representation for infinity (INF).  1/(1/0) produces zero. The above treatment of 1/(1/0) occurs in an FPU-equipped machine even when SANE is bypassed and the FPU programmed directly.IBM Floating point numbers are 80-bits with a hardware FPU, 64-bits when emulated.  The way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever compiler or assembler was used for a program. On older DOS complilers exceptions could cause program aborts; 1/0 and 1/(1/0) would abort to the DOS prompt at the point where they occured.  Most present compilers handle this better.  Result: there is little consistent handling of numbers between DOS, Windows and OS/2 programs nor between programs for just one OS.Networking [Includes printing]WYSIWYG printing can be a problem with either Mac of IBM machines especially if one sends TrueType fonts to a older style PostScript printer.MacHardware: Built-in LocalTalk network port and a built-in printer port.  LocalTalk has moderate speeds (230.4 Kb/s) requires special connectors for each machine ($15 and up) and can be run off of either the printer port {to include very old macs} or the network port {standard today}.  Built-in Ethernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at about $150-$300 for each machine.  These cards provide three connectors and transceivers {thick, thin, and 10BaseT} for Ethernet.The Macintosh Quadra family and some Centris models includes Ethernet interface on motherboard, with transceivers available. TokenRing has been a network option since 1989.Software: AppleTalk {the suite of protocols} standard with Mac OS, which can use variety of media types.  AppleShare client software included with the OS as well and can connect to file servers such as Novell Netware, 3Com 3+Open, Banyan Vines, DEC Pathworks, Apple's AppleShare servers, System 7 File Sharing machines, and AFP servers running on variety of UNIX hosts.  MacTCP allows typical TCP/IP communications (telnet, ftp, NFS, rlogin).  A later version will have Unix X/Open Transport Interface (XTI) built-in by the end of 1993 (MacWeek 04/12/93).  Third-party software to connect to NFS servers.  DEC Pathworks provides DECnet support.  Peer-to-peer file sharing software built-in to System 7.1 (See OS section).  Full server software is extra. Printing requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in the chooser.  Changing printers is by selecting a different name in the chooser.  The same is true of connecting to servers.Printing bugs:  Monaco TrueType font is different then the screen bitmap font. {QuickDraw QX is suppossed to fix this and similar problems.}IBM  Hardware: LocalTalk [not widely used], Ethernet,  and TokenRing.Software: Novell Netware, Banyan Vines, DECNet, Windows/Work Groups, AppleTalk protocols, and AppleShare {subset of AppleTalk}.Each of the MS-DOS networking schemes are, in general, totally incompatible with the others. Once you have chosen one, you are pretty much locked-in to that product line from then on.  Windows/Work Groups is a little more forgiving and removes some of this problem.  Novell Netware is the biggest, {~80 percent of the corporate market.} and in general is more powerful and offers better control/management/security than AppleShare, but it's also more complex to set up and manage.  This will change due to the use of the Mac finder and file management system by Novell. (PC Week 12/14/92 & 12/28/92;  InfoWorld Dec 14/92; MacWeek 3/22/93)Printing {Very OS dependent}DOS: If it's a single user, then you plug the printer into the parallel port,  and don't worry about it {Tweeking may be needed with poorly written  software}.  Network Printing is not controlled by the system, but is mostly  implemented by the actual program, therefore performance varies from one  software program to the next.Windows 3.x: supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing "jobs"  in the print queue, but it always lists printers as "active"... even if they  are not.  This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers  on the same net, because there's no way for software to reliably determine  which printer is active right now.  Windows for Workgroups is more Mac-like  and intelligent about this.OS/2: Mac-like; the os deals with printers, with apps making calls to the OS.Printing bugs: due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do not have WYSIWYG printing.  This is the fault of the programs in question and not that of the OS involved.Price issue: This is very dynamic with Mac providing more build-in features than IBM and IBM being more 'get only what you need' then Mac and price wars by both worlds.The IBM machines' modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware standarization, which in turn requires OSes and programs to be very complex to handle ALL the variation in hardware.  When one adds all the standard Mac hardware features to an IBM {built-in input/output sound support, SCSI, PDS,  built-in monitor support, built-in networking, standard mouse interface, and NuBus 90 in higher machines} the Mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent equipted IBM machine {Especially since some IBM monitors can be used with Macs which cuts some more of the Mac's cost (MacUser Aug 1992:158-176)}. Some prices using some of the info in this sheet and MacUser April 1993.All Macs below come with a PDS slot, VRAM, and SCSI-1 built in.  Except where noted, monitor is extra and a built-in monitor interface is provided {no card needed except for 24-bit color display}.IBM planned a $1,200 386SLC/25MHz model with a 60MB hard drive and color VGA monitor {~VRAM} (MacWeek 8/17/92) {sounds like a Color Classic without SCSI-1, sound support, built-in network support, FPU socket, built-in expansion to 16-bit color, etc}.Color Classic:  $1,389 - 030/16MHz with 16-bit data bus {~386sx/20MHz equivalent}, 4/80, FPU socket, and built-in monitor.LCIII: $1,499 - 030/25MHz {~386dx/33MHz equivalent}, and 4/160.Centris 610: $2,899 - 68LC040/20MHz {Depending on the program ~486sx/40 or ~'486dx2sx'/20[40]MHz equivalent}, 8/230, built-in ethernet, 300i CD-ROM, a PDS/NuBus 90 slot and VRAM for 16-bit color.Centris 650: 040/25MHz {Depending on the program ~486dx/50 MHz or 486dx2/50 MHz equivalent} with a PDS and 3 NuBus 90 slots. $3,189 {ethernet, 8/80}; $3,559 {ethernet, 8/230}; $3,999 {ethernet, 8/230, CD-ROM, VRAM for 16-bit color}Bibliography notes'Vaporware' is available in the digest/vapor directory by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu [36.44.0.6] and was by Murphy Sewall {last issue: April 93.}'Info-IBMPC Digest' back issues are available from wsmr-simtel20.army.mil in directory PD2:<ARCHIVES.IBMPC>'Dictionary of Computer Terms 3rd ed.'

 26Hi!   I'm looking into buying a serial port switcher, because while my Mac hastwo serial ports, I have AppleTalk, a modem, a printer, MIDI, and a sounddigitizer.  (2 != 5, unfortunately.)   Specifically, I'm looking at the Axion electronic switcher, because itseems to be fairly cheap.  (About $128 at MacZone.)   Does anyone know anything about it?  I've heard that with most of thesethings you can still only use 2 serial ports at a time, it just prevents youfrom physically swapping cables.  Although I've also heard that programsthat use the Comm Toolbox may be able to use as many serial ports as theywant; does anyone know if this is true with the Axion switchbox?   Finally, if the Axion stinks, or if you're using something else that youthink is good, I'd be interested in hearing about other products.  I wouldlike to spend under $140, if possible.   Please reply through mail; I'm not a regular reader of this newsgroup.If there's interest, I can post a summary of replies.Thanks a lot!M. Scott Smith  (umsmith@mcs.drexel.edu)

That's all handled by thechip.  About the only the timing could be wrong is if Apple programs theclock registers wrong on the 96.  That, however, should only really hurtsynchronous transfer, which is not used by the Mac SCSI Manager.Furthermore, disabling blind writes should be meaningless on a Quadra.On Macs that used the 5380, which is a much lower level SCSI chip, theMac was responsible for the handshake of each byte transferred.  Blindmode affected how the Mac handled that handshake.  On the 5396, thehandshake is entirely handled by the chip.--Tim Smith

Apple can't deliver that right now because the 040 saps too muchpower, radiates far too much heat, and is too large for a notebook. Howdoes one get around that without designing a new chipset? Use existingPowerBook technology to your best advantage. The Duo Dock gives Apple aunique ability to give users that 040 power in a "Semi-Portable" fashion.By plunking the 040 into the Dock, you've got "quadra" power at your desk.On the road, that 33mhz 68030 should be able to handle most of your needs.Okay, not the BEST solution, but its an answer to a no-win situation. :-)So, does this mean one will be able to use the PowerBook's processor inparallel to the dock's processor?

 34I have some questions about this subject.  I like to leave mycomputer on if I think I'm going to be using it withing the next 2 or3 hours, but I get sick of my Dad constantly coming up to me andasking "Why is the computer on if you're not using it?"  I alsowonder about my computer being harmed by fluctuations in voltage fromother things (garbage disposal, etc.)  Here are my questions: How much harm do voltage fluctuations cause?  My computer does notshare a circuit with anything big but our my light dims when arefrigerator comes on or the garbage disposal is turned on (whosedoesn't?), and also when the washing machine does anything.  Allthese things cause a drop in voltage which is harmful to a computer,right?  I also notice the fan in my System Saver turning at differentspeeds.  Is it safer to turn it off and back on when I want to use itor to leave it on? How much electricity does my computer use?  I have an Apple IIgs (neflames), with a Kensington System saver GS (1 electric fan inside),an AppleColor RGB monitor, and an EXTERNAL 3.5" HD (1 fan and its ownP/S).  How do I translate this into Kilowatt-Hours?  Also, how muchof this is used by the monitor? Does the monitor use considerably less juice when the screen istotally black but still on? Many computers spin the HD up and down constantly to save power.  Ialways thought this was harmful to the HD and defeats the purpose ofleaving the computer on in the first place (except portables).  Isthis true? Thanks for the Info.  I think this will help lots of people. Stacy
 18Finally got my computer fixed and I'd like to sum up.About hard drive companies: the original 160 meg drive that was bad (badsector or something) was an IBM.  The new one is a Quantum.  Is the LCIIIsupposed to be shipped with IBMs?  Is there a quality difference? Apparently! :)Second, about hard drive position.  I've put the LCIII on its side andthe new 160 HD has had no problems at all.  I've even switched back andforth between horizontal and vertical and there are no problems.  As faras I'm concerned I don't believe HD position is important for drives upto 160 meg, in any computer.

She tells me that those whopurchased the LaserWriter Pro 600 in a 4 megabyte (300dpi, nogreyscale) configuration should contact their original dealerswho are supposed provide the 4-meg memory upgrade.  For thosewho don't know, the extra 4-meg will allow printing at 600dpi or greyscale (at 300dpi).If the dealers have questions, they should be directed to theirhardware support numbers and/or Apple Customer Assistance 1-800-776-2333, 408-996-1010 (corporate number).Regards,GlennP.S. - personally, I'm annoyed at our school bookstore.  Theyreally have an obligation to provide this information to allof the customers who purchased the 600 in the original configuration (they have the records...that's why they ask forthings like a phone number).  When I get my upgrade completed, I'm going to write Apple and complain.

 33I'm a system and network admin. One of my users has a Duo 230([*]specifications below) that has been having slowdown problems.Leaving the Duo on for several hours causes it to slow downunacceptably. It can take 10-15 seconds to change applications. Duringthis time it is completely hung.  If he reboots, the problem goes away(For a while). It seems the system is getting itself into a wedgedconfiguration.He's re-installed System 7.1 and rebuilt the desktop. Neither of thesehave helped. It's possible that it's network-related, he uses Eudora which checks hisemail every 10 minutes (over Ethernet). He hasn't checked to see if thisproblem occurs while undocked (he's docked most of the time). Little to no non-Apple inits, I don't want to start yanking the restunless I know that might *really* be the problem. He hasn't tried zapping the PRAM, I have advised him to do that next.Anyone who has ideas, I'd love to hear about them. I'd call Apple, butI've found they're best to call during the week (it's Sunday evening).[*] Powerbook Duo 230  16/120. 12mb RAM card from Tech Works to replacenon-self-refreshing 8mb card.

 14Anyone know what would cause my IIcx to not turn on when I hit the keyboardswitch?  The one in the back of the machine doesn't work either...The only way I can turn it on is to unplug the machine for a few minutes,then plug it back in and hit the power switch in the back immediately...Sometimes this doesn't even work for a long time...I remember hearing about this problem a long time ago, and that a logic board failure was mentioned as the source of the problem...is this true?Thanks,T.J.

Advice from a grad student.I agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me.The important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and learn as much as possible about it.  In my five years of education in this field, though brief compare to alot of people, I had to think about this kind of question a lot.  Did I make the right decision in going intoElectrical Engineering as opposed to Computer engineering orCS?  The more I go thru school, the more I believe that thiskind of question is irrelevant.   I have come to believe that choosing CS because one does not like hardware or choosing hardware because one doesnot like to program is really doing an injustice of buildingand computer and making it useful for something.  Everythingis interwoven and inseparable.  CS, CE, and EE are all a part of a really great discipline and do depend on each other.My advice is don't limit yourself, but make a decisionbased on which major will give you the best opportunities to learn.  That of course depends on the curriculum at your persective school.  I would choose a major that allows me toexplore as much as possible.  Beside, I don't know why theschool would make a student choose a major before her/hissophamore year.                  Hey you may be so interested in this field that you decided to learn all about the making of computers in which case, you suffer a little more and go to grad school.About the money.  Don't look at the averages, if youare good, you are going to earn more money than anyone else. If you are a superstar programmer, you will earn millions.  Like wise if you are a hotshot computer designers.        - Chung Yang

Apple will offer a miniature video camera that can be mountedabove the user's monitor or moved about on the end of its cable to takepictures of objects or documents. Taking advantage of the 32-bitdigital signal processor (DSP) built into the systems' logic boards,the camera will be able to put an image measuring 360 by 288 pixels,with 256 gray levels, on the screen.Users will be able to install supplementary lenses that can recorddetail as fine as the wire bonds on an integrated circuit. The camerais expected to cost between $150 and $250.The systems will ship with all the software needed to put Apple'sCasper voice-recognition technology to work; users apparently will haveto purchase an operational high-fidelity microphone.The two models will talk as well as listen. A new system facilitycalled the Speech Manager will convert text strings sent byapplications to phonemes and then pass them to a speech synthesizer.The Cyclone will include a 40MHz '040, three NuBus slots and supportfor up to 128MB of RAM. The Tempest will use a 25MHz LC040, lacking anFPU, and hold up to 68MB of RAM; it will have a single slot that willrequire a NuBus adapter and have room for only 7-inch NuBus cards.Users will be able to update the Tempest's process but not theCyclone's.For more get the 02.22.93 issue of MacWeek.

 31Well,    You can always try and find a PC dealer who sells guaranteed memory.I work at a company growing at 40% a year, we have on order hundredsof computers per year.  It never fails, machines come in with BAD SIMMS.Now for those of you who are wondering just WHY your PC or MAC just crashedI can tell you I always thought it was the incompetent ass who wrote ordesigned the software.    Well, I don't think that way anymore, especially with the results Ihave gotten with replacing BAD SIMMS in my own machine and others at work.The moral to this story is to MAKE SURE your memory is good.  I wouldbe willing to bet lots of you out there have SIMMS with either softor hard errors on them and you don't even know about it, but every oncein awhile those bad SIMMS just makes your life hell.   I just got plain SICK of dealing with peoples complaints that thier machinejust crashed and they lost thier work.  In case your wondering, or if youhaven't already guessed I work in an IS department.  Service is a do or dieperogative in this line of work, so the MORAL IS:  HAVE YOUR MEMORY TESTEDwith a SIMM hardware tester...and NO I don't mean the simple little softwareprograms that you can run in your machine.  SIMMS are complicated littlebeasts and they needs special hardware to test them effectively.If any of you are interested in getting one of these nifty little deviceswhich are not cheap, write me back.  They make life a little bit easier, andbesides they pay for themselves in a short time from the loss of productivitypeople would have to deal with when thier machine commits suicide.-Greg Carter

The Duo's memory is faster than its equivalent desktopmachine by 5-10% (and the rest of the powerboks). I think theexplanation for this was that it can refresh faster (in 2 instead of 5cycles I believe).  Things that could affect performance would befactors such as use of functions enhanced in the FPU (which the Duodoesn't have undocked).  Extensions and background applications canslow your computer down too.  Real life differences in speed are likelyto be influence by the software you are running, what kind of screendepth you are running etc.EspenPS!  The Duo is 32-bit through-out.

I don'tremember who made this board, and I haven't seen it advertised inany of the latest Mac magazines.  It mentioned that it included softwareto make the SIMMs on the board act like a RAM disk. As someone who has SIMMS he can't get rid of/use, but hates the waste, this sounds to me like a majorlygood idea.  Does anyone out there know what board/company I'm talking about?  Are they still in business, or does anyone know where I can get a used oneif they are no longer made?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

 12   I have tested this on a 230 and it does work there.  So it wouldseem that the 140 and 170 are out though.  One way to tell is togo and open the PowerBook control panel(7.1).  There is a settingthere that allows you to set the time to wake up the Mac.  If itis present when you open the control panel, then you can assume thatSetWUTime will work.  -- Andrew E.

 24        I am currently managing, among many other labs, a lab with three LC IIs, a Mac Plus with 45 MB external HD, and a LaserWriter II NTX. My problem? The LC IIs seem to intermittently slow to a snail's pace.        These LC IIs have 4 MB RAM, 256K VRAM, and a Quantum LP105S HD installed. I have reformatted the drive with Hard Disk Toolkit 1.3, and it gives a very respectable 2.9 overall rating to this drive, so it's not the drive. I have reinstalled System 7.1, MS-Word 5.1a, MS-Works 3.0, and so on, all from the master disks. In short, I have done everything I can think of in software. I am *not* a hardware hacker, though I pop cases fairly often. But nothing works.        The problem is intermittent and unpredictable. The mouse always moves smoothly, floppies always run at the same speed, but occasionally, for about 1-2 hours at a time, a machine will run like it was running on a 4 MHz 68000, not a 16 MHz 68030. It is VERY frustrating and makes it nearly unusable. It does seem to worsen with increasing disk activity.        Has anyone encountered this problem before? Has anyone got any ideas? They would be much appreciated.                                    -- Andrew Geweke---douce@tfsquad.mn.org (Andrew Geweke)The Firing Squad BBS, public access Usenet mail and news.  +1 612 291 2632Saint Paul, Minnesota

If you're at all interested in this merchandise, please e-mail me:djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu I'm compacting my system and moving to a single monitor system, so I havetwo monitors and cards for sale. Nothing at all is wrong with these pieces,I'm just wanting to conserve desk space, and get all of my info from onescreen. I'd prefer to sell to people near Austin and surrounding areas (withindriving distance - like an hour away perhaps), but I CAN ship to you if youdon't live near here. Only problem is that I didn't keep the original boxesfor the monitors, but I'm confident that my few months of full-time servicein the shipping room will enable me to safely package the monitors andflip it in your direction. Details: Mirror Full Page Display (monochrome) w/nubus card:---------------------------------------------------**SOLD** Sony 1304 14" color monitor:----------------------------What's to say? It got top ratings in last year's MacUser report. It's a SONY,Trinitron, arguably the best (but I'd rather not argue that point).It's a great monitor, in great shape, but I'm going to a bigger screen,and although I'd like to keep it, finances don't justify it. Still selling for $599 at MacLand (where I bought it originally - notincluding shipping), will sell for **$400** [was $475 orig. asking price](plus shipping). Again, make an offer if that sounds unreasonable.  RasterOps 24si (24-bit accelerated, hardware zoom/pan, 4 meg RAM):------------------------------------------------------------------Renamed the 24sx a few months after I bought it, this board is for 13"monitors, providing **accelerated 24-bit**, hardware zoom/pan, NTSC mode(you can plug it into something like the RasterOps Video Expander and outputNTSC), and 4 RAM slots that use 1 meg or 4 meg SIMMS for GWorld RAM, or aRAM disk. Software included for such functions. 4 meg of RAM included (1 megSIMMS). Selling for $605 at Bottom Line (without the RAM - add $100), I'm asking**$425** [was $525 orig. asking price](shipping included this time,it's just a card). Original box and packaging. I'd actually prefer to sellthe Sony monitor and this card together, so if you want both, drop me e-mailand make a "bundled offer" for these items. If you check the May 93 (or was it Feb 93) Macworld mag, you'll find that the24sx (or 24si - same thing) board did extremely well in the tests for 13-14"640 x 480 24-bit boards. Also supports up to 1120 (or so) x 512 in 24-bit, soyou can fit two pages width-wise via the scrolling desktop thang. It's a greatboard, but I'm going to a 19" monitor, and it can't help me there.------------ Cheers. -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Dan Keldsen            |  Are you now, or have you ever been:djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu |  a.

Idon't have the manual in front of me, but as I recall, you insert the CDwhile the machine is running, select Restart from the special menu, andthen hold down a special sequence of keys to force it to boot from the CDinstead of the hard disk.

 18Hello Forrest:I noticed your recent posting regarding crashes of the Duo 230.  At thepresent I own a PB100 and a IIsi.  I had been contemplating selling both andgeting a 230.  Based upon your experiences would you make thatrecommendation?This is the first time I had heard of any problems with the Duo.  Is this thenorm.  Have you been able to work around the problems?Thanks for responding!************************Reply to Donald Lyles  *Internet: dcl@his.com  *************************

 14hello out in networld,       We have a lab of old macs(SEs and Pluses). We don't have enough money to buy all new machines, so we are considering buying a few superdrives for our old macs to allow folks with high density disks to use our equipment. I was wondering what experiences (good or bad) people have had with this sortof upgrade.murraymurray@andromeda.rutgers.edu
 19A rep at the dealer (actually it's a university order center, sothey don't have any immediate financial interest), told me thatthey have been having lots of problems with their Centris 610.He didn't go into details, but mentioned problems with thefloppy drive and intermittent problems with printing files.It sounded to me like they were having both hardware problemsand software compatibility problems with the machine.He's not recommending the Centris 610 to anybody; he says toconsider a Centris 650 or a IIvx. (Why he would recommend aIIvx over an LCIII I don't know, but that's what he said.)So, what does the net think? Did the dealer just get one flakymachine, or did Apple send the C610 out the door too early?Is your C610 working just great, or is it buggy too?Jay Scottscott@cs.uiuc.edu

 149NNTP-Posting-Host: carson.u.washington.eduHere is how I modified my Quadra 700 for higher speed. Previously Ihad been using a Variable Speed Overdrive for accelerating my CPUbut this modification is testing out as more stable at higher speeds.Your mileage may vary. The top speed you achieve cannot be predictedbefore hand. My personal Q700 has tested fine up to 32 mhz thus far.I didn't have higher speed clock oscillators on hand to test higherspeeds.PartsClock Oscillators (4 pin TTL variety) You will need a selection ofspeeds beginning at 50 mhz on up. The CPU will run at 1/2 theoscillator speed. The original one is a 50 mhz unit. I recommendgetting a 50 mhz clock in case you damage the existing one.   I obtained my clock oscillators from DigiKey 1-800-344-4539 for   less than $5.00 each. Some of their part numbers are:   50 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X121)   62 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X136)   66 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # CTX137)   Don't get the half size clock oscillators. They won't fit.   There are also CMOS clock oscillators. I haven't tried one in a   Quadra. (They work fine in IIsi's)   Socket: Obtain a 4 pin socket which is in the same form factor as   a 14 pin DIP package. Alternatively, use 4 machined socket pins   from an Augat style socket. Just cut them out of the socket.Cooling Fan: A very small 12 volt fan to keep the CPU cool is a    must. My VSO came with a specially modified heatsink which had   a fan built onto it. It had a pass-through connector which   tapped into the hard drive power cable. You should rig up    something similar or risk frying your CPU.   Procedure1)  Insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warnings here.2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do    this. Unplug ALL cables, wall and monitor power supply cords fromthe back of the mac. 3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you    need release. 4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed    to release it.                                            5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful    here.7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from slidingposteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly thenlift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.8)  Remove the interrupt switch assembly. It is a strangely shaped plastic    device at the left, front edge of the motherboard. Pull the middle,rear plastic prong up and forward. The entire device will release.9)  Unplug the speaker cable. Squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to    free it then swing it backwards to free it from the case.10) Remove the motherboard form the case. Lift the front right corner of    the motherboard about 1 mm. This allows it to clear the clear plasticPower light guide. Slide the motherboard forward about 1 cm. Themotherboard then comes directly out.11) Locate the 50 mhz clock crystal. It is a small metal box near the    CPU chip. Note and remember its orientation. The new clock oscillatorsmust be aligned with pin 1 in the same orientation.Very carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator. Some ofthe pins may be bent over. Simply desolder then unbend them. Be sureyour desoldering iron is hot enough before heating the board.I used a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this task. This isNOT appropriate for a first soldering experience. The motherboard isa multi-layer design with very fine traces - easily damaged withoutproper care.12) Install your socket or socket pins where the old oscillator once was.13) Put a 50 mhz clock oscillator into the new socket. You could use theold clock but it has solder on its pins. This may come of inside thesocket and cause corrosion problems later. I suggest using a new50 mhz clock.14) Install your cooling fan system to complete the modification.14) Reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place.15) Snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother    board firmly. Plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard.16) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly intoplace while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks    into place.17) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY    DRIVE CABLE.18) Replace the phillips head screw19) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.20) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount.21) Reattach your cables and power cords. Cross your fingers and turn     on the Mac. It should make the usual power on chord. If it doesn't,something is amiss. Immediately turn of the power and recheck yourhandiwork. If all is not well, you have my sincere condolences.Hopefully, all will work normally. Turn the machine back off andreplace the 50 mhz clock oscillator with a faster one. Reboot andbe astounded. You will need to fully test the machine for many hours before decidinga particular speed is truly usable. With my VSO, a machine lock-upmight take 8 hours of operation to occur. In the brief time sincemodifying my clock oscillator (36 hours) I have not had a singleproblem.Good Luck to all who attempt this modification. There is a small but realrisk, but you could well reach Quadra 950 speeds or higher with less than$50 in parts.Guy Kuo <guykuo@u.washington.edu>

 19I have a question for y'all:I'm looking at an ad for the new 3.5" FAST SCSI-2 drives from Micropolisin the June, 1993, MacWorld. (I have seen similar ads for the IDE versionsin IBM PC magazines)Well, the ad says that all three drives have a FAST SCSI-2 interface,but then it says that the DTR rate for each drive is 5 megabytes/second,*max*.How can this be?  I thought that if a drive was to be FAST SCSI-2 ithad to have a DTR of 10megs a second?(I am assuming the 5megs/sec claim by Micropolis is from the 512k cache.I admit that I would be very impressed if the drive can *read/write* dataat 5megs a second!)Thank you.
 11Message-ID: <1r0lakINNg3g@shelley.u.washington.edu>NNTP-Posting-Host: carson.u.washington.eduSummary: Quadra Clock Chip Swap SuccessKeywords: Quadra,clock,accelerateAfter reading reports from Germany of success in accelerating a Quadraor Centris simply by changing the clock oscillator, I decided to test theclaim.

I put a socket in the clock's place and inserted a64 mhz TTL clock oscillator I had left over from working on some SI's.I can't believe it. It actually works. I'm not getting SCSI timing errorseither. This is only after a short run time but I'll keep posting results.Did I spend all that money on the VSO for nothing?

 35 I have an old Mac Plus. A couple of years ago I bought a shiney new lc.It came with apple's new keyboard (with abd ports). i replaced it witha mac-pro-plus extended keyboard (which i thoroughly enjoy, thank youvery much). well, i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plusbut there's a little problem. the plus uses an rj-11 jack for keyboardinput and the new keyboards don't. i got an extra adb cable from mylocal apple dealer (they're such nice people), but they couldn't tellme the order of the wires. there are four wires in the adb cables: black, white, red, tan. I knowone's a ground, one gets the serial signal, one supplies 5 volts, andi forgot what the fourth one does. anyway, if you hook them up wrongyou'll fry a board and i <really> don't want to do <that>. if any brave souls out there have done this before, please e-mail yourexperience directly to me. i would greatly appreciate it especiallysince apple's original keyboard is not . . . ergonomically correct. btw, i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find thecorrelation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since ithas both, but no such luck (the connections are soldered inside oflittle boxes). Oh, well . . . ******************************************************************  Tis the blink of an eye, tis the draught of a breath,        **  From the blossoms of health, to the paleness of death,       **  From the gilded saloon, to the briar in the shroud,          **  O, why should the spirit of mortal be proud?                 **                                                 -William Knox *******************************************************************  shagberg@vm.cmp.ilstu.edu                                    ******************************************************************

However, the guy who has the card tells me there's aDB-9 or DB-15 (can't remember now) on the back of the card, rather thanthe 8-pin (or 4-pin) mini-din that I expect.  This sounds more like aThicknet ethernet card.  Should there be a transciever on it, like on theQuadras?

I hope that is ok)JoseBad RAM brings some Duos down. (random access memory boards for AppleMacintosh PowerBook Duos) MacWEEK v7, n7 (Feb 15, 1993):132.COPYRIGHT Coastal Associates Publishing L.P. 1993By Raines Cohen     Austin, Texas - Some third-party memory-expansion cards for PowerBookDuos depart from Apple specs in ways that could cause crashes, data lossand other problems.     Technology Works Inc., a RAM and network vendor based here, last weekissued a warning about three problems it said it had found in Duo RAMproducts from some competing vendors, which it declined to identify.Other vendors and an Apple spokeswoman confirmed that the problems exist.     > Self-refresh.  The Duos require a kind of dynamic RAM calledselfrefreshing, which can recharge itself while the system sleeps.  ButTechnology Works said some vendors have sold Duo cards withnonselfrefreshing DRAM, which can cause the system to lose data or fail towake from sleep.     Most leading memory manufacturers include the letter V in the partnumber stamped on their self-refreshing chips; nonself-refreshing chipsinstead have an L, according to TechWorks.  The chip label, however, maynot tell the whole story.  Newer Technology of Wichita, Kan., said it usesnonself-refreshing chips but adds its own circuitry to keep them refreshedwhile the Duo sleeps.     > Speed.  Some RAM-card vendors have put 80-nanosecond DRAM on Duocards rather than the 70-nanosecond type the 230 requires, TechnologyWorks said.  However, some chips labeled as 80- or 85-nanosecond arecertified by the manufacturer to run at a higher speed.     Kingston Technology Corp. of Fountain Valley, Calif., said it offersDuo RAM cards with 80-nanosecond chips, but only for the Duo 210, which iscompatible with the slower chips.     > Space.  Technology Works charged and Apple officials confirmed thatsome third-party cards are too large to fit properly, forcing the cornerof the Duo keyboard up and preventing the system from starting up normallywhen in a Duo Dock.     Lifetime Memory Products Inc. of Huntington Beach, Calif., said itoriginally shipped cards with this problem but has since offered allcustomers free upgrades to cards that fit.
 20Hi there!I wonder if anyone knows and can recommend me a good NuBus displaycard for driving a 14" multisync (NEC 3D)?The NEC 3D can do horizontal refresh from 15.5 kHz to 38 kHz andvertical from 50 Hz to 90 Hz and can do max 1024x768 interlaced,though I am looking for something more like 800x600 or 832x624noninterlaced.It would be very nice to find a card which can be programmed quitefreely within these limits and is capable to display at least8bits/pixel, preferably more.Is there anything on the market that comes even close?Thanks--Jartsu
 13I posted on here about a problem with a Datadesk 101e keyboard thatfailed to rebuild the desktop with the command-option keys pressedor to shut off inits when pressing the shift key.  After absolutelyno help from Datadesk I called MacConnection tech support.  They tried it outon their Centris 610 and had the same problem.  They immediately offeredto get a new keyboard, try it on their Centris and ship it to meovernight if it worked.  I could send them my keyboard back after Igot the one that worked.  This is from a guy in Tech support named Dave.It turns out that the keyboard will wrok if you wait for the smiley facebefore pressing the shift key to disable inits and wait for the inits to start appearing to rebuild the desktop by pressing command-option.  I really likethis keyboard so I was glad to be able to keep it.  On the other hand,Datadesks tech support sucks while MacConnection's is great!-Terry

 52Approximately four months ago, I purchased a Quantum 240LPS HD from La Cie for$649. After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there wereintermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining5.41 wouldn't even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie andexchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.Well, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems.Often, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if Ithen insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the driveby making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart theIIsi and boot from the HD. I've called La Cie again and they've given meanother RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn't seethe drive there's a definite hardware problem.Given that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to sendme a *new* one, but they said "no." Also, within three weeks after I purchasedmy original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.I can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendorsmake a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. AndI understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to suddenprice fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of thesefacts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above thatwhen I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the onethey will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I'll have to againreinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for datarecovery.)It seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at adiscounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (stillcovered under a 90-day warranty) should be new. I feel a little helpless about all this. I don't mean to necessarily flame LaCie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful.But c'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I senta letter to La Cie's customer service when the first drive was returned and Iasked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drivethree weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to applythe credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn't even have the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)What's the moral of this story? I'm not sure. But I do know I won't buy anyother products from La Cie in the future.Bill Krauthammerf2ehg786@umiami.ir.miami.eduPS Please don't email or post about how good your La Cie product and servicehas been. I'm not suggesting that they are not a good company or anything likethat. All I'm saying is that I've had a disappointing experience with them andI'll be taking my business elsewhere in the future.

This may include the ability for the system to fully power downthe monitor, via a controllable power outlet, and power it back onautomatically.  (Is this a "sell" on screen saver software companies?)Goals for "idle" power consumption have been set at something like 30watts for the system, not including the monitor (? don't quote me onthis).Note that in many businesses, the savings will be substantial,especially if you factor in reduced load on air conditioning systems.Sun did a study that indicated that simply powering off monitors forthe night would save the company (Sun itself) on the order of $1M peryear.  Putting other (and automatic) power-saving features in wouldprobably have greater than double that value.Given that we are seeing more and more reason to leave our work andhome computers on (getting faxes, automatically getting email, ...),building power consumption control into all machines has a potential tocut ~2% off the national power consumption, based on data I heard.BTW: when encouraging employees to power off monitors when leavingwork, it was pointed out that this should only be done with monitorswith the power switch on front.  There was some indication thatmonitors with power switches on the rear are not designed to toleratelots of power cycling.  This may only apply to the monitors we use, butmight be worth checking if you happen to have a monitor with the switchin back.

I've seen this sort of effect when a runaway program (which could be caused by an INIT conflict, for instance) accidentally wacks on a register in the video hardware.  Have you tried booting with no extensions and then letting the Q950 just sit there in the Finder?  You might also want to try changing to 24-bit addressing (yes, I know you can't access your full 64 MB of RAM - it's just an experiment) as the video hardware registers can't be accessed then.Another thing to try as a 'recovery' measure is to use something like QuickKeys to change the pixel depth of the display.

Still selling for $599 at MacLand (where I bought it originally - notincluding shipping), will sell for **$475** (plus shipping). Again, make anoffer if that sounds unreasonable.  RasterOps 24si (24-bit accelerated, hardware zoom/pan, 4 meg RAM):------------------------------------------------------------------Renamed the 24sx a few months after I bought it, this board is for 13"monitors, providing **accelerated 24-bit**, hardware zoom/pan, NTSC mode(you can plug it into something like the RasterOps Video Expander and outputNTSC), and 4 RAM slots that use 1 meg or 4 meg SIMMS for GWorld RAM, or aRAM disk. Software included for such functions. 4 meg of RAM included (1 megSIMMS). Selling for $605 at Bottom Line (without the RAM - add $100), I'm asking**$525** (shipping included this time, it's just a card). Original box andpackaging. I'd actually prefer to sell the Sony monitor and this cardtogether, so if you want both, drop me e-mail and make a "bundled offer"for these items. ------------ Cheers. dan keldsen - djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Dan Keldsen            |  Are you now, or have you ever been:djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu |  a.

I bought my machine a couple of weeks ago as well andstarted to experience these problems.Apple Australia via my dealer said that this problem has a number ofpotential causes - Faulty applications, faulty third party hardware(modems, memory etc), system software, PRAM corruption and powermanager corruption, and the Duo hardware itself.None of the above are relevant in my case except the last two maybe(no applications were running, the system software was re-installed, Ihave no additional hardware). I have found that clearing PRAM appearsto help for a while at least (hold down command option P and R onstartup). Unfortunately the problem returns suggesting that PRAM isbeing corrupted by something (system software bug ? - I don't have anynon-issue inits in my system). Apparently the Power Manager can bereset by "holding the reset and interrupt buttons while powering up" -Apple's advice - but since the Duo does not have an interrupt buttonI'm not sure what they mean in this case. This may also help ifsomeone can decipher Apple's advice for me.Beyond this Apple suggest that " you should follow the technicalprocedures to check the hardware of this Duo". Since so many othersappear to be having the same problem it would seem to me that therehas been a system software bug introduced somewhere along the line -and quite recently too - since it only seems to be recent Duo 230purchasers who have this problem.Any more comments from others in the same boat are welcome,particularly Apple Duo engineers :-)cheersbrucet--           bruce tulloch sydney australia - brucet@extro.ucc.su.oz.au***complex problems have straight forward, easy to understand wrong answers***

Sounds vaguely similar to a problem I had a long time ago when I was  trying to use Kermit.  I was building a serial connection between my Duo 210  and my NeXT.  I think the problem was in the handshaking.  Basically, you need  to make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides.  A safe  place to start is by selecting NO handshaking on either end.  One problem is  that the Zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it  wrong, and only a reset will clear it.  I don't know the specifics.  But this  could be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system.   It could very well be that you are doing things right--eventually-- but one  wrong move (like trying a bad handshaking protocol) can screw up any further  correct actions, until the next machine reset.  I have wedged my Mac and also  my NeXT that way.Now I can send files back and forth between the Duo and the NeXT without any  problem, and at pretty high speeds too.I don't know what kind of chip the PC uses, but I think the Zilog 8530 is  pretty standard.Hope this helps,-Avery

 21Jeff,  I have answers to both of your questions.  First, I recommend the SonyCPD-1320 monitor.  It is a 14" Trinitron VGA monitor, but it is designedspecifically for use with the LC.  It works only with Macs with specific videocapabilities which means only the LC's and anything after the ci.  All ittakes is a MAC<->VGA cable (I recommend one from James Engineering which isabout $20).  These cost about $335 as compared to the much higher prices ofcomparable monitors because they are not multisynch.  I have used one for halfa year and I love it.  Second, I have used Syex and found them to be decent.  I had a backorder on aSupra modem which I cancelled.  They were helpful in explaining the reasonswhy there were delays and they had Supra's number ready for me.  The onlycomplaint was that they did not always return my calls.  I have been told that the CPD-1320 is selling for $339 from J&R's(800)221-8180.  I think Syex is a little more, but I don't know.-David**** From Planet BMUG, the FirstClass BBS of BMUG.

 30Message-ID: <1r2pm7$44k@tierra.santafe.ede>NNTP-Posting-Host: sfi.santafe.edeX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]Several weeks ago, I described a problem with my Apple High-Resolutionmonitor and promised to summarize replies received by e-mail. Torecapitulate: Occasionally, every two or three hours or so, my monitormomentarily loses sync. The entire raster image bounces down about aneighth of an inch or so, then rights itself. This usually happens rightafter I close a large window, highlight a large area, or do something thatradically alters the image on the screen. Sometimes, though, it happenswith no provocation whatsoever.I have received a bewildering range of replies. At one extreme wasa man, clearly quite knowledgable about monitors, who said that theproblem was that the 13" monitor's power supply simply couldn't alwayskeep up with sudden changes of the raster image; the rapid change froma largely light screen to a largely dark one overtaxed the monitor'spower supply. There was no fix available, he said, because nothing wasreally wrong. (I guess he meant that the flaw was so fundamental thatit had to be endured.)This seemed quite persuasive and I would have been tempted toadopt an attitude of stoicism, except for a reply from a 13" monitorowner who discovered that this very problem is documented in the Apple Service Technical Procedures, Volume 3, under the headingJitter Correction. The section describes a fix involving the replacementof a capacitor, the adjustment of a potentiometer, or, failing that,the swap of a circuit board.I would be grateful for a discussion among those who have hadexperience with this sort of thing.

The C610isn't like the IIsi was, meaning that the motherboard of the C610 is actually designeds to run at the speed of the CPU, and not designed torun at a higher speed (like 25MHz) but be forced to run at the speed ofa slower CPU (20MHz).>I didn't see any oscillators on the motherboard like the ones on the IIsi's>motherboard!  Where is the oscillator for the Centris?    There is more than one oscillator. If you are talking about the CPUoscillator chip, I think that it is located under the socket for the'040. At least this is what I have read in some other posts in thisgroup.-Hades
 12armani@edgeway.wimsey.bc.ca (Anand Mani) writes:>Besides the faster processor, the 950 has SCSI 2, and as far as I know,>faster I/O due to separate processors handling those functions.    Mostly. The Q950 does have a SCSI2 controller chip as it's SCSIchip, but it does not have the chips to use the Wide or Fast SCSI-2modes and therefore doesn't offer much more in the way of SCSIperformance over the Q900. It does, howrever, have a faster I/Ocontroller than the Q900; this is where the real speed boost comes from.-Hades

The second part is   posted to comp.sys.mac.system and features many questions about  system  software.  The third part is posted every two weeks in  comp.sys.mac.misc.  Tables of contents for those two pieces are  included above. Please familiarize  yourself with all three  sections of this document  before posting.            All pieces  are available for anonymous ftp from  rtfm.mit.edu (18.172.1.27) in the directory   pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh.  Except for this introductory  FAQ which appears in multiple newsgroups and is stored as  general-faq.Z, the name of each file has the format of the last  part of the group name followed by "-faq.Z", e.g the FAQ for  comp.sys.mac.system is stored as system-faq.Z and the FAQ for  comp.sys.mac.misc is stored as misc-faq.Z.  RTFM stores files as   compressed (.Z) BINARY files.  If you leave off the .Z at the end  of  the file name when "getting" the file, rtfm will automatically   decompress the file before sending it to you.  You can also have   these files mailed to you by sending an E-mail message to   mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the line:  send  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh/"name"  in the body text where  "name" is the name of the file you want as  specified above (e.g.  general-faq).  You can also send this server a message with the  subject "help" for more detailed instructions.        ====================  I HAVE A QUESTION...  (1.0) ====================         Congratulations!  You've come to the right place.  Usenet is   a wonderful resource for information ranging from basic questions  (How do I lock a floppy disk?) to queries that would make Steve  Jobs himself run screaming from the room in terror.  (I used  ResEdit to remove resources Init #11, WDEF 34, and nVIR 17 from my  system file and used the Hex Editor to add code string #A67B45 as a  patch to the SFGetFile routine so the Standard File Dialog Box  would be a nice shade of mauve.  Everything worked fine until I  installed SuperCDevBlaster, and now when I use the Aldus driver to  print from PageMaker 5.0d4 to a Linotronic 6000 my system hangs.   P.S.  I'm running System 6.0.2 on a PowerBook 170.)          Since the Macintosh newsgroups are medium to high volume, we  ask that you first peruse this FAQ list including at least the  table of contents for the other pieces of it, check any other  relevant on-line resources listed below in question 1.2, especially  the FAQ lists for the other Macintosh newsgroups, and RTFM (Read  the Friendly Manual) before posting your question.  We realize that  you are personally incensed that the System is taking up fourteen  of your newly-installed twenty megs of RAM, but this question has  already made its way around the world three hundred times before,  and it's developing tired feet.  Finally, before posting to any  newsgroup (Macintosh or otherwise), please familiarize yourself  with the basic etiquette of Usenet as described in the newsgroup  news.announce.newusers. HOW DO I USE THIS DOCUMENT?  WHERE CAN I GET IT?  (1.1)               comp.sys.mac.faq is currently divided into multiple pieces,  a general introduction which you're reading now, and specific lists  for the newsgroups comp.sys.mac.system and comp.sys.mac.misc.  FAQ  lists for comp.sys.mac.wanted, comp.sys.mac.apps and  comp.sys.mac.hardware are in development.  When ready each part  will be available in its respective newsgroup.  All pieces are  available via anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu in the  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh directory. Except for this  document itself which is named general-faq.Z the pieces are named  as per the last part of the newsgroup they cover  followed by  "-faq", e.g. system-faq.Z, misc-faq.Z.  The .Z means the  file is  stored compressed so you'll need to ftp it in binary mode and use  either MacCompress, StuffIt Deluxe, or the UNIX uncompress command   to decompress it.  However if you leave off the ".Z" extension when   you "get" the file, rtfm will automatically decompress the file  before sending it to you.            This introductory document is posted to all of the concerned  newsgroups.  The tables of contents for each of the specific FAQ  lists are at the beginning of this file so you should be able to  get  at least some idea whether your question is answered anywhere  else in the FAQ even if you don't have the other parts at hand.   It's not always obvious, especially to newcomers, where a  particular question or comment should be posted.  Please  familiarize yourself with the FAQ lists in all the major Macintosh  newsgroups before posting in any of them.  Which questions appear  in which FAQs can serve as a basic guide to what posts belong  where.            To jump to a particular question search for  section-number.question-number enclosed in parentheses.  For  example to find "Where can I FTP Macintosh software?" search for  the string  "(2.1)".  To jump to a section instead of a question  use a zero for  the question number. WHAT OTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE?  (1.2)      comp.sys.mac.faq provides short answers to a number of   frequently asked questions appropriate for the Usenet newsgroup  comp.sys.mac.misc and comp.sys.mac.system.  Four other files are  worthy of particular note: Daryl Spitzer maintains a FAQ list  covering Macintosh programming for the newsgroup  comp.sys.mac.programmer.  It's posted to that group weekly and   available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.uoregon (128.223.8.8) in   /pub/mac.  Eric Rosen maintains a frequently asked questions list   for comp.sys.mac.comm available in that newsgroup and from  rascal.ics.utexas.edu in mac/faq (where the file you're reading now  is also irregularly archived).  This list answers many frequently  asked questions about networking, UNIX and the Mac,  telecommunications, and foreign file formats.  Norm Walsh has  compiled an excellent FAQ for comp.fonts that answers a lot of  questions about the various kinds of fonts and cross-platform  conversion and printing.  It's available in comp.fonts or by ftp  from ibis.cs.umass.edu in /pub/norm/comp.fonts/FAQ*.  Finally Jim  Jagielski maintains a FAQ for comp.unix.aux covering Apple's UNIX  environment, A/UX.  It's posted every 2 to 3 weeks in comp.unix.aux  and news.answers. It's available for anonymous ftp at  jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov. WHICH NEWSGROUP SHOULD I POST TO?  (1.3)        There are no stupid questions, but there are misplaced ones.   You wouldn't ask your English teacher how to do the definite  integral  of ln x between zero and one, would you?  So don't ask  the programmer newsgroup why your system is so slow when Microsoft  Word is in the background.  Ignorance of basic netiquette is not an  excuse. If you want people to help you, you need to learn their  ways of  communicating.          Posting questions to the proper newsgroup will fill your  mailbox with pearls of wisdom (and maybe a few rotten oysters too  :-) ).  Posting to the wrong newsgroup often engenders a thundering  silence.  For instance the most common and glaring mispost, one  that seems as incongruous to dwellers in the Macintosh regions of  Usenet as would a purple elephant to Aleuts in the Arctic, asking a  question about networking anywhere except comp.sys.mac.comm,  normally produces no useful responses.  Posting the same question  to comp.sys.mac.comm ensures that your post is read and considered  by dozens of experienced network administrators and not a few  network software designers.           Please post to exactly ONE newsgroup.  Do not cross-post.   If a question isn't important enough for you to take the extra  minute to figure out where it properly belongs, it's not important  enough for several thousand people to spend their time reading.   For the same reason comp.sys.mac.misc should not be used as a  catch-all newsgroup.           The breakdown of questions between different newsgroups in  this document can also serve as a reasonable guide to what belongs  where.  Specifically questions about productivity applications  (software you bought your Macintosh to run, not software you bought  to make your Macintosh run better) should go to comp.sys.mac.apps  unless the application is covered in a more specific newsgroup.   Communications programs, games, HyperCard, compilers and databases  all have more topical comp.sys.mac.* newsgroups.  Post questions  about non-communications hardware including questions about what  software is necessary to make particular hardware work to  comp.sys.mac.hardware.  Questions about MacOS system software  belong in comp.sys.mac.system.  Questions about utilities and  extensions normally belong in comp.sys.mac.misc.  Questions about  A/UX go to comp.unix.aux.  Detailed questions about Appletalk  belong in comp.protocols.appletalk.           Direct questions about HyperCard to comp.sys.mac.hypercard.   Non-HyperCard programming questions and questions about development  environments should go to comp.sys.mac.programmer.  ResEdit  questions may be posted either to comp.sys.mac.misc,  comp.sys.mac.system, or comp.sys.mac.programmer; but generally the  netters who inhabit the darker recesses of comp.sys.mac.programmer  are considerably more practiced at the art of resource hacking.            A general exception to the above rules is that any VERY  technical question about an application that actually begins to  delve into the how's of a program as well as the what's (Recent  example: How does WriteNow which is written entirely in assembly  compare to other word processors written in high level languages?)  might be better addressed to the programmer newsgroup.             For Sale and Want to Buy posts should go to  comp.sys.mac.wanted and misc.forsale.computers.mac ONLY.  We  understand that you're desperate to sell your upgraded 128K Mac to  get the $$ for a PowerBook 180; but trust me, anyone who wants to  buy it will be reading comp.sys.mac.wanted.  Political and  religious questions (The Mac is better than Windows! Is not! Is  too! Is not! Is too! Hey! How 'bout the Amiga! What about it? Is  Not! Is too!) belong in comp.sys.mac.advocacy.  Anything not  specifically mentioned above probably belongs in comp.sys.mac.misc.           Finally don't be so provincial as to consider only the  comp.sys.mac newsgroups the appropriate forums for your questions.   Many questions about modems in comp.sys.mac.comm are much more  thoroughly discussed in comp.dcom.modems.  Questions about Mac MIDI  are often better handled in comp.music even though it's not a  Macintosh specific newsgroup.  Shop around.  Usenet's a big place  and not everything relevant to the Macintosh happens in  comp.sys.mac. 4. SOMEONE JUST ASKED WHY THE SYSTEM WAS TAKING UP SIXTEEN OF THEIR  TWENTY MEGABYTES OF RAM.  SHOULDN'T I PUT MY BRILLIANCE AND WIT ON  DISPLAY FOR THE WORLD BY POSTING THE SEVENTEENTH RESPONSE?      No.  Frequent answers are just as boring and uninteresting as  frequent questions.  Unless you really have something new to add to  the traditional answers (such as the recent discovery that fonts in  System 7.1 could eat memory) private E-mail is a much better medium  for answering common questions like this one.            You might want to add a mention of this FAQ in your E-mail  response and a polite suggestion that your correspondent read it  before posting future questions.  I do read all the newsgroups  covered here and have written a small script in MicroPhone II that  lets me send PWFAQ's (people with frequently asked questions) the  section of this document that answers their question with just the  click of a button so please don't feel obligated to respond to  someone who cares so little about the answer to their question they  can't be troubled to read the FAQ list to get it.     ===  FTP  (2.0)  === WHERE CAN I FTP MAC SOFTWARE?  (2.1)      The three major North American Internet archives of shareware,  freeware, and demo software are sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6),  mac.archive.umich.edu (141.211.165.41), and wuarchive.wustl.edu  (128.252.135.4) which mirrors the other two sites and several  others. Wuarchive often holds on to files after other sites remove  them for space concerns, and still has files that were deleted from  the formerly important site, rascal.ics.utexas.edu.  Rascal was  notable for storing its files in MacBinary format rather than the  less efficient BinHex format common at the other archives.  Unless  otherwise noted shareware and freeware mentioned in this document  should be available at the above sites.         To keep traffic on the Internet manageable, Scandinavians   should try connecting to ftp.funet.fi (128.214.6.100), ftp.lth.se  (130.235.20.3), or sics.se (192.16.123.90) instead.  Those in   the U.K. should look first at src.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.2.1).   Continental Europeans can try nic.switch.ch (130.59.1.40),    ezinfo.ethz.ch (129.132.2.72), and anl.anl.fr(192.54.179.1).   Australian users should try to find what they want at archie.au  (139.130.4.6) which mirrors info-mac and mac.archive.  Japanese  users will find sumex mirrored at ftp.u-tokyo.ac.jp  (130.69.254.254).          A fourth very important site is ftp.apple.com (130.43.2.3).   This is Apple's semi-official repository for system software,  developer tools, source code, technical notes, and other things  that come more or less straight from Apple's mouth.  Some material  at this site may not be distributed outside the U.S. or by other  sites that don't have an official license to distribute Apple  system software.  Please read the various README documents  available at ftp.apple.com for the detailed info if you're  connecting from outside the U.S. or if you wish to redistribute  material you find here. CAN I GET SHAREWARE BY E-MAIL?  (2.2)      The info-mac archives at sumex-aim are available by E-mail from  LISTSERV@RICEVM1.bitnet (alternately listserv@ricevm1.rice.edu).   The listserver responds to the commands $MACARCH HELP, $MACARCH  INDEX, and $MACARCH GET filename.  Mac archive files are available  from mac@mac.archive.umich.edu.  Send it a message containing the  words "help" and "index" (no quotes) on the first two lines of your  message for instructions on getting started and a list of the files  you may request.  You can retrieve files from other sites by using  the server at ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com.  For details send it a  message with just the text "help" (no quotes). WHERE CAN I FIND APPLICATION X?  (2.3)      If you can't find what you're looking for at one of the above  sites, try telnetting to your nearest archie server or sending it  an E-mail message addressed to archie with the subject "help."   Archie servers are located at archie.rutgers.edu (128.6.18.15,  America), archie.mcgill.ca (132.206.2.3, the original archie server  in Canada), archie.au (139.130.4.6, Australia), archie.funet.fi  (128.214.6.100, Scandinavia), and archie.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.3.7,  the U.K. and the continent).  These sites index the tens of  thousands of files available for anonymous ftp.  Login as "archie"  (no password is needed) and type "prog filename" to find what  you're looking for or type "help" for more detailed instructions.   For instance you would type "prog Disinfectant" to search for a  convenient ftp site for Disinfectant.  If the initial search fails  to turn up the file you want, try variations on and substrings of  the name.  For instance if you didn't find Disinfectant with "prog  Disinfectant", you might try "prog disi" instead.  Substring  searches often hide the gold in a pile of dross.  To avoid many  erroneous matches add a ".*\\.hqx" to the end of the substring, e.g.  "prog disi.*\\.hqx"  Most Mac software available on the net ends in  .hqx but almost no UNIX or PC software does.          Please check the above archives and ARCHIE personally BEFORE  asking where you can find a particular piece of shareware.  If you  follow the above advice, you should almost never have to ask the  net where to find a particular piece of software. CAN SOMEONE MAIL ME APPLICATION X?  (2.4)      No.  Nor will anyone mail you a part of a file from  comp.binaries.mac that was corrupt or missed at your site.  Please  refer to the first questions in this section to find out about  anonymous FTP, archie, and automatic E-mail servers. WHAT IS .BIN? .HQX? .CPT? .ETC?  (2.5)      Most files available by FTP are modified twice to allow them to  more easily pass through foreign computer systems.  First they're  compressed to make them faster to download, and then they're  translated to either a binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary (.bin) format  that other computers can digest.  (The Macintosh uses a special  two-fork filing system that chokes most other computers.)  BinHex  files are 7-bit ASCII text files, while MacBinary files are pure  8-bit binary data that must always be transferred using a binary  protocol.           How a file has been translated and compressed for  transmission is indicated by its suffix.  Normally a file will have  a name something like filename.xxx.yyy.  .xxx indicates how it was  compressed and .yyy indicates how it was translated.  To use a file  you've FTP'd and downloaded to your Mac you'll need to reverse the  process.  Most files you get from the net require a two-step  decoding process.  First change the binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary  (.bin) file to a double-clickable Macintosh file; then decompress  it.  Which programs decode which file types is covered in the table  below.  Also note that most Macintosh telecommunications programs  will  automatically convert MacBinary files to regular Macintosh  files as they are downloaded.***************************************************************************Suffix:      .sit  .cpt  .hqx  .bin  .pit  .Z  .image  .dd  .zip .uu  .tar Extractors--------------------------------------------------------------------------StuffIt 3.0|   X     X     X     X     X                  Compact Pro|         X     X Packit     |                           XUUTool     |                                                      X MacCompress|                                X SunTar     |               X     X     X                                X BinHex 5.0 |                     X BinHex 4.0 |               X DiskDoubler|                           X                X UnZip      |                                                   X DiskCopy   |                                     X macutil    |         X     X           X                X***************************************************************************     A few notes on the decompressors:      StuffIt is a family of products that use several different  compression schemes.  The freeware StuffIt Expander will unstuff  all of them.  Versions of StuffIt earlier than 3.0 (StuffIt 1.5.1,  StuffIt Classic, UnStuffIt, and StuffIt Deluxe 2.0 and 1.0) will  not unstuff the increasing number of files stuffed by StuffIt 3.0.   You need to get a more recent version of StuffIt or StuffIt  Expander.              StuffIt 3.0.5 (Lite and Deluxe) consistently makes smaller  archives than any other Macintosh compression utility.  To allow  maximum space for files on the various ftp sites and to keep  net-bandwidth down, please compress all files you send to anonymous  ftp sites with StuffIt 3.0.5.            UUTool, MacCompress, and SunTar handle the popular UNIX  formats of  uuencode (.uu), compress (.Z), and tar (.tar)  respectively.  The UNIX versions are often more robust than the Mac  products, so use them instead when that's an  option.  Translators  that allow StuffIt Lite to expand uuencoded and tar files are also  available by anonymous ftp.            Macutil is dik winter's package of UNIX utilities to  decompress and debinhex files on a workstation before downloading  them to a Mac. Since UNIX stores files differently than does the  Mac, macutil creates MacBinary (.bin) files which should be  automatically converted on download.  It can't decompress  everything. In particular it can't decompress the new StuffIt 3.0  archives. :-(  However, if you need only one or two files out of an  archive--for instance if you want to read the README to find out if  a program does what you need it to do before you download all of  it--macutil is indispensable.  It can be found at sumex-aim in the  info-mac/unix directory.     A few notes on the compression formats:      .bin:  These are MacBinary files.  Always use a binary file  transfer protocol when transferring them, never ASCII or text.   Most files on the net are stored as .hqx instead.  Only rascal  stores most of its files in .bin format.  Most communications  programs such as ZTerm and MacKermit are capable of translating  MacBinary files on the fly as they download if they know in advance  they'll be downloading MacBinary files.        .image: This format is normally used only for system software,  so that on-line users can download files that can easily be  converted into exact copies of the installer floppies.  Instead of  using DiskCopy to restore the images to floppies, you can use Steve  Christensen's freeware utility  MountImage to treat the images on  your hard disk as actual floppies inserted in a floppy drive.   MountImage has a reputation for being buggy, so you should have  some blank floppies and a copy of DiskCopy handy just in case.        .sea (.x, .X):  .sea files don't merit a position in the above  table because they're self-extracting.  They may have been created  with Compact Pro, StuffIt, or even DiskDoubler; but all should be  capable of decompressing themselves when double-clicked.  For some  unknown reason Alysis has chosen not to use this industry standard  designation for self-extracting archives created with their   payware products SuperDisk! and More Disk Space.  Instead they   append either .x or .X to self-extracting archives. HOW CAN I GET BINHEX?  STUFFIT?  ETC.?  (2.6)      By far the easiest way to get these programs is to ask a human  being to copy them onto a floppy for you.  If you're at a  university there's absolutely no excuse for not finding someone to  give you a copy; and if you're anywhere less remote than McMurdo  Sound, chances are very good that someone at a computer center,  dealership, or user group can provide you with a copy of StuffIt.   Once you have StuffIt (any version) you don't need BinHex.             If you're such a computer geek that the thought of actually  asking a living, breathing human being instead of a computer   terminal for something turns you into a quivering mass of   protoplasmic jelly, you can probably download a working copy  of  StuffIt from a local bulletin board system.            If you have religious objections to software gotten by any   means other than anonymous ftp, then I suppose I'll mention that   you can in fact ftp a working copy of StuffIt though this is by   far the hardest way to get it.  Ftp to wuarchive.wustl.edu and   login.  Type the word "binary."  Hit return.  Type "cd  mirrors/rascal.ics.utexas.edu/compression" and hit return.  Then  "get StuffIt_Expander_1.0.1_SEA_bin"  and hit return.  Of course  it's always possible that by the time you read this StuffIt  Expander will have been updated and the name changed so if this  fails look for something similar.  If you've ftp'd straight onto  your Mac you should now have a self-extracting archive which will  produce a working copy of StuffIt Expander when double-clicked.  If  you've ftp'd to your mainframe or UNIX account first, you still  need to use a modem program to download it to your Mac.  Just make  sure that the Mac is receiving in MacBinary mode and the mainframe  is sending in binary mode.  If you need more details on the last  step, consult the FAQ list for comp.sys.mac.comm and the manuals  for both your mainframe and Macintosh telecommunications software.      HOW CAN I GET BINHEX, STUFFIT, ETC. FROM A PC?  (2.7)       You can't.  There is absolutely NO way to get an executable  Macintosh file from an ftp site onto a PC and then onto your Mac  without some software obtained by means other than anonymous ftp.  You MUST beg, borrow, or steal the necessary software such as  Binhex or StuffIt Lite from another person.  I realize this may   terrify those among you who haven't left your parents' basement   since you got an  Apple II+ in 1980, but eventually you're going   to need to link up with some human being other than your mother.    (though I suppose if you're this much of  a nerd you could send   your mother out to get it for you.)  While you're gathering  your nerves for a venture into the strange and terrifying world   of daylight, please don't bother the net by asking this question  again.  There simply is no way to move executable Macintosh  programs from a PC or other non-Macintosh computer onto a   Mac without software that is not bundled with most Macs.=================================================================TROUBLESHOOTING: WHAT TO DO (BEFORE POSTING) WHEN THINGS GO WRONG (3.0)=================================================================          While the various FAQ lists cover a lot of specific  problems, there are far more problems that aren't covered here.   These are a few basic techniques you should follow before asking  for help.  You should probably also perform the ten-step  preventative maintenance routine described in section four,  especially rebuilding the desktop (4.3) and resizing the system  heap (4.5).  Following these steps may  or may not solve your  problem, but it will at least make it easier  for others to  recommend solutions to you. IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM.  (3.1)      "Microsoft Word is crashing" doesn't say much.  What were you  doing when it crashed?  Can you repeat the actions that lead to the  crash?  The more information you provide about the actions  preceding the crash the more likely it is someone can help you.   The more precisely you've identified the problem and the actions  preceding it (Step 1) the easier it will be to tell if the  following steps fix the problem.  For example, "Sometimes  QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes with a coprocessor not installed error." is  not nearly as helpful as "QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes when I link two  text boxes on a master page when copies of those text boxes already  contain text."  The former will leave you wondering whether the bug  remains after a given step.  The latter lets you go right to the  problem and see if it's still there or not. READ THE READ ME FILE.  (3.2)      Many companies include a list of known incompatibilities and  bugs in their READ ME files.  Often these aren't documented in the  manual. Read any READ ME files to see if any of the problems sound  familiar. CHECK FOR VIRUSES.  (3.3)      Run Disinfectant or another anti-viral across your disk.  Virus  infections are rarer than most people think, but they do occur and  they do cause all sorts of weird problems when they do. REINSTALL THE APPLICATION AND ALL ITS SUPPORT FILES.  (3.4)            For half a dozen reasons (external magnetic fields,  improperly written software, the alignment of the planets) a file  on a disk may not contain the data it's supposed to contain.  This  can cause all types of unexplained, unusual behavior.  Restoring  from original masters will normally fix this. REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE.  (3.5)        Bits are even more likely to get twiddled in the system file  than in the application and the effects can be just as disastrous.   See question 4.6 for a detailed procedure for performing a  clean  reinstall.            If the problem continues to occur after you've taken these  steps, chances are you've found either a conflict between your  application and some other software or a genuine bug in the  program.  So it's time to ISOLATE THE PROBLEM.  (3.6)            You need to find the minimal system on which the problem  will assert itself.  Here are the basic steps of isolating the  cause of a system or application crash:       a.Run only one application at a time. Occasionally applications do     conflict with each other.  If the problem does not manifest itself     without other applications running simultaneously, you can begin     launching other applications until you find the one that causes      the crash.          b.If you're running System 6, turn off MultiFinder.  If you're     running System 7, allot as much memory to the application as you      can afford.  Sometimes programs just need more memory, especially      when performing complicated operations.          c. If you're running System 7, turn off virtual memory and 32-bit     addressing.  There's still an awful lot of System 7 hostile     software out there including some from companies that really      have no excuse.  (Can you say Microsoft Word 5.1, boys and girls?       I knew you could.)  Some of this software only expresses its      incompatibilities when certain uncommon actions are taken.          d.Boot from a virgin system floppy.  If the problem disappears     you likely have an init conflict.  You need to progressively remove     extensions until the problem vanishes.  Use a little common sense     when choosing the first extensions to remove.  If the problem occurs     when you try to open a file, remove any inits that mess with the     Standard File Open procedure such as Super Boomerang first.  If the     problem remains after the obvious candidates have been eliminated,     either remove the remaining extensions one at a time or, if you have     a lot of them, perform a binary search by removing half of the     extensions at a time.  Once the problem disappears add half of the     most recently removed set back.  Continue until you've narrowed the     conflict down to one extension.  When you think you've found the     offending init restart with only that init enabled just to make      sure that it and it alone is indeed causing the problem. CONTACT TECHNICAL SUPPORT.  (3.7)      By now you should have a very good idea of when, where, and why  the conflict occurs.  If a tech support number is available for the  software, call it.  If you're lucky the company will have a work  around or fix available.  If not, perhaps they'll at least add the  bug to their database of problems to be fixed in the next release.     ======================  PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE  (4.0) ======================      You wouldn't drive your car 100,000 miles without giving it a  tune-up.  A computer is no different.  Regular tune-ups avoid a lot  of problems.  Although there are Mac mechanics who'll be happy to  charge you $75 or more for the equivalent of an oil change, there's  no reason you can't change it yourself.  The following nine-step  program should be performed about every three months.  TRASH UNNEEDED FILES  (4.1)      Many of the operations that follow will run faster and more  smoothly the more free disk space there is to work with so spend a  little time cleaning up your hard disk.  If you're at all like me,  you'll find several megabytes worth of preferences files for  applications you no longer have, archives of software you've  dearchived, shareware you tried out and didn't like, announcements  for events that have come and gone and many other files you no  longer need.  If you're running System 7 you may also have several  more megabytes in your trash can alone.  Throw them away and empty   the trash. RETHINK YOUR EXTENSIONS  (4.2)      Some Macintoshes attract inits like a new suit attracts rain.   Seriously consider whether you actually need every extension   in your collection.  If you don't use the functionality of an  extension at least every fifth time you boot up, you're probably  better off not storing it in your System Folder where it only takes  up memory, destabilizes your system, and slows down every startup.   For instance if you only read PC disks once a month, there's no  need to keep AccessPC loaded all the time.  Cutting back on your  extension habit can really help avoid crashes.  REBUILD THE DESKTOP  (4.3)      The Desktop file/database holds all the information necessary  to associate each file with the application that created it.  It  lets the system know what application should be launched when you  open a given file and what icons it should display where.   Depending on its size each application has one or more  representatives in the desktop file.  As applications and files  move on and off your hard disk, the Desktop file can be become  bloated and corrupt.  Think of it as a Congress for your Mac.   Every so often it's necessary to throw the bums out and start with  a clean slate.  Fortunately it's easier to rebuild the desktop than  to defeat an incumbent.            One warning: rebuilding the desktop will erase all comments  you've stored in the Get Info boxes.  Under System 7 Maurice  Volaski's freeware init CommentKeeper will retain those comments  across a rebuild.  CommentKeeper also works with System 6 but only   if Apple's Desktop Manager extension is also installed.            To rebuild the desktop restart your Mac and, as your  extensions finish loading, depress the Command and Option keys.   You'll be presented with a dialog box asking if you want to rebuild  the desktop and warning you that "This could take a few minutes."   Click OK. It will take more than a few minutes. The more files you  have the longer it will take.  If you're running System 6 you may  want to turn off MultiFinder before trying to rebuild the desktop.             If you're experiencing definite problems and not just doing  preventive maintenance, you may want to use Fifth Generation's  freeware init Desktop Reset.  Desktop Reset completely deletes the  Desktop file before rebuilding it, thus eliminating possibly  corrupt data structures.     ZAP THE PRAM AND RESET THE CLOCK  (4.4)      All Macs from the original 128K Thin Mac to the Quadra 950  contain a small amount of battery powered RAM to hold certain  settings that properly move with the CPU rather than with the disk  such as which disk to boot from.  Unfortunately this "parameter  RAM" can become corrupted and cause unexplained crashes.  To reset  it under System 7 hold down the Command, Option, P, and R keys  while restarting your Mac.  Under System 6 hold down the Command,  Option, and Shift keys while selecting the Control Panel from the  Apple menu. Click Yes when asked if you want to zap the parameter  RAM.  Since you've erased almost all the settings in the General  Control Panel, you should now reset them to whatever you want.            The one setting that zapping the PRAM does not erase is the   date and time; but since the internal clock in the Macintosh is  notoriously inaccurate you'll probably want to take this  opportunity to reset it anyway. RESIZE THE SYSTEM HEAP  (4.5)       Even after rethinking their extensions as per step two most  people still have at least half a row of icons march across the  bottom of their screen every time they restart.  All these  extensions (and most applications too) need space in a section of  memory called the System Heap.  If the System Heap isn't big enough  to comfortably accommodate all the programs that want a piece of  it, they all start playing King of the Mountain on the system heap,  knocking each other off to get bigger pieces for themselves and  trying to climb back on after they get knocked off.  All this  fighting amongst the programs severely degrades system performance  and almost inevitably crashes the Mac.           If you're using System 7, your Macintosh will automatically  resize the system heap as necessary; but if you're running System 6  it's important to set your system heap size large enough to manage  all your extensions and applications.  By default this size is set  to 128K, way too small for most Macs with any extensions at all.   The system heap size is stored in the normally non-editable boot  blocks of every system disk.  Bill Steinberg's freeware utility  BootMan not only lets you resize your system heap but even checks  how much memory your heap is already using so it can tell how much  needs to be allocated.  If you're running System 6, get BootMan,  use it, and be amazed at how infrequently your Macintosh crashes. REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE  (4.6)      System files can become corrupt and fragmented, especially if  you've stored lots of fonts and desk accessories inside them.   Merely updating the System software will often not fix system file  corruption.  I recommend doing a clean reinstall.  Here's how:    1.  Boot from the installer floppy of your System disks.      2.  Copy any non-standard fonts and desk accessories out         of your System file into a temporary suitcase.    3.  Trash the System file on your hard disk.  Also trash the         Finder, MultiFinder, DA Handler, and all other standard Apple         extensions like Control Panel and Chooser.  These will all be         replaced in the new installation.  If you're running or         installing System 7, move everything in the Extensions,         Control Panels, and Preferences folders into the top level         of the System Folder.    4.  Rename the System Folder.  Any name other than System Folder         is  fine.    5.  Double-click the installer script on your System disk.  Then         choose Customize...  Select the appropriate software for your         model Mac and printer.  You could do an Easy Install instead,         but that will only add a lot of extensions and code you don't         need that waste your memory and disk space.    6.  Once installation is finished, move everything from the         temporary folder you created in step 4 into the new System         folder.  If you're asked if you want to replace anything, you         forgot to take something out in step 3.  You'll need to replace         things individually until you find the duplicate piece.     7.  Reinstall any fonts or DA's you removed in step 2.    8.  Reboot.  You should now have a clean, defragmented System file         that takes up less memory and disk space and a much more stable         system overall.     DISK UTILITIES  (4.7)      Much like system files hard disks have data structures that  occasionally become corrupted affecting performance and even  causing data loss.  Apple includes Disk First Aid, a simple utility  for detecting and repairing hard disk problems, with its System  disks. It's also available for anonymous ftp from ftp.apple.com in  the  directory dts/mac/sys.soft/hdsc.  Even if you have an earlier   version, you should get the latest version (7.1) from ftp.apple.com  and run it on all your hard disks.              Several companies have released payware disk utilities that  detect and repair considerably more problems than Disk First Aid  though, interestingly, none of them detect and repair everything  that Disk First Aid does.  The three most effective for general  work are Central Point's MacTools Deluxe 2.0, Fifth Generation's  Public Utilites, and Symantec's Norton Utilities for the Macintosh  2.0.  A department or work group should have all of these as well  as Disk First Aid since none of them fix everything the others do.   For individuals MacTools ($48 street) is about half the price of  Norton ($94 street) or Public Utilities ($98 street) so, features  and ease of use being roughly equal, I recommend MacTools.            All of these products occasionally encounter problems they  can't fix.  When that happens it's time to backup (4.7) and  reformat (4.9).     BACKING UP  (4.8)      This is one part of preventative maintenance that should be  done a LOT more often than every three months.  The simplest back  up is to merely copy all the files on your hard disk onto floppies  or other removable media.  If you keep your data files separate  from your application and support files then it's easy to only back  up those folders which change frequently.  Nonetheless every three  months you  should do a complete backup of your hard disk.            A number of programs are available to make backing up  easier.  Apple included a very basic full backup application with  System 6.  With the Performas Apple ships a new Apple Backup  utility that can backup the entire disk or just the System folder  onto floppies.  The previously mentioned Norton Utilities for the  Mac and MacTools Deluxe 2.0 include more powerful floppy backup  utilities that incorporate compression and incremental backups.           Finally if you're lucky enough to have a Tape Drive, network  server, or removable media device to use for backups, you should  check out the more powerful payware utilities Redux ($49 street,  doesn't support tape drives) and Diskfit Pro ($74 street).  There  are NO freely available backup utilities other than the old HD  Backup from System 6.   DISK DEFRAGMENTATION  (4.9)      As disks fill up it gets harder and harder to find enough free  space in the same place to write large files.  Therefore the  operating system will often split larger files into pieces to be  stored in different places on your hard disk.  As files become more  and more fragmented performance can degrade.  There are several  ways to defragment a hard disk.           The most tedious but cheapest method is to backup all your  files, erase the hard disk (and you might as well reformat while  you're at it.  See question 4.10.), and restore all the files.            A number of payware utilities including Norton Utilities for  the Mac and Mac Tools Deluxe can defragment a disk in place, i.e.  without erasing it.  Although the ads for all these products brag  about their safety, once you've bought the software and opened the  shrink-wrap they all warn you to back up your disk before  defragmenting it in case something does go wrong.  There are NO  freeware or shareware disk defragmenters so please don't annoy the  net by asking for one.  REFORMAT YOUR HARD DISK  (4.10)      Just as a floppy disk needs to be initialized before use, so a  hard disk must be formatted before it can hold data.  You don't  need to reformat every three months; but when your system is  crashing no matter what you try, reformatting is the ultimate means  of wiping the slate clean.  Reformatting your hard disk may even  gain you a few extra megabytes of space.  Not all hard disks are  created equal.  Some can hold more data than others.  To facilitate  mass production and advertising without a lot of asterisks (* 81.3  megabytes is the average formatted capacity.  Your mileage may  vary.)  Apple often formats drives to the lowest common denominator  of drive capacity.  When you reformat there's no reason at all not  to reclaim whatever unused space Apple's left on your disk.              Unlike floppies hard disks need a special program to  initialize them. Most hard disks come with formatting software.   Apple's disks and System software ship with HD SC setup, a minimal  disk formatter which will format Apple brand hard drives ONLY.   Most other manufacturers ship appropriate formatting software with  their hard drives.  Normally this will be all you need to reformat  your hard disk.           A number of general-purpose formatters are also available  which go beyond the bundled software to include features like  encryption, password protection, multiple partitioning, faster disk  access, System 7 compatibility, and even compression.  Two of the  best are the payware Drive7 and Hard Disk Toolkit Personal Edition  ($49 street for either).  While there are one or two freeware  formatters available, none are likely to be superior to the ones  bundled with your hard disk.            PowerBook users should be sure to turn off Sleep and  processor cycling before reformatting their hard drives no matter  what software they use.  Otherwise disk corruption, crashes, and  data losses are a very good possibility.

When I got my lowly classic II, the options were 40 or 80Mharddrives, and it was clear that buying another 40M of harddrive space would cost *much* more than the difference in price between the two config-uartions.  There is an analogous break in the LCIII/80 and 160 prices, and you will not regret spending the extra money for a larger harddrive.  Particularly if you ever wind up wanting to use SoftPC, which sets up aseveral-MB (up to 30!) partition, or if you are generating large files with DTP software, or if you might ever want to check out a mac unix-like os, like MachTen, having the extra space will be helpful.  when you are pricing used IIci's, look at the harddrive size they come with, and how muchit would cost you to add more storage down the road... (Might be a useful bargaining strategy even if you see no reason to go over 80M, thoughI must admit that I am such a packrat that within 6 months of getting my computer, I was backing up a lot of stuff to floppies that I rarely use to because I was running out of space, without having started using DTP stuff, softPC or trying any unix os!)-Peterbell@minerva.cis.yale.edu

 22Message-ID: <1ps2eiINNc09@hp-col.col.hp.com>NNTP-Posting-Host: hpcsrc13.col.hp.com  I have a Radius Precision Color 24x video card for the Mac that fits in a NuBus slot.  The card has 3 Mb of VRAM on it, which means that 24-bit color is possible on the card!  The card supports just about any monitor scanrate you can think of (I used it at 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768, but itcan go higher).  You can switch resolutions and depth on the fly with asoftware control panel.  This is the ACCELERATED version of the card, which means all QuickDraw calls are not executed by the CPU but taken over by the video card, freeingup the mac processor for other tasks.   The cheapest I could find this card for when I called around last nightwas $1738 at Mac's Place.  I will sell it for $1250 + shipping.  It is justover a year old and never been any problem.  It comes with software and theoriginal manuals.  Hurry!Chris Magnusonchrism@col.hp.comHewlett-Packard Company(719) 590-2963

You can set the number of rings that will receive the fax on a specific ring you set with Fax STF software.  It's entirely up to you how to arrange that.

 33Add me to the list of bugged 230 owners.I had a bunch of problems regarding sleep/wakeup/restart with the 230 whenI first got it, both with and without the techworks ram.  Finally it "died",wouldn't start, until I  opened the docking door (which snaps open) and the machine came up fine, but with the clock a few decades off.  Apple replaced the processor board.Now,  twice the machine has frozen (no mouse action)  twice the machine has refused to wake up.  Acutally, the backlighting    came on, and the disk spins when the power adaptor is plugged in    (but not with a good battery).    The first time this happened removing both power adaptor and battery      for ~1 minute brought the machine back.    The second time this happened the machine wouldn't wake up until      powered down for about 30 minutes.  The screen had what looked      like red horizontal lines accross it.

 17Nntp-Posting-Host: ironman.ms.nwu.eduI'm having a real tough time finding out the proper adapters to use a VGAmonitor (an IBM 8513 sold w/ many PS/2's to be exact) on the Mac LC III. All of the vendors I have called say that the internal video will not workon a true VGA monitor but will work on a IBM Compatible multisync like thesony's or the NEC monitors.  I thought the VGA capability of LCIII was veryattractive because it allowed you to use inexpensive VGA monitors.  Am Iconfused or are these vendors just not up to speed?  Has anyone used anLCIII with a non multisync VGA monitor and if so where did you get youradapter (please be specific w/ vendor and cat #)?  I would prefer to get aapple monitor for these LCIII's (it's unseemly to see the finder inside anIBM bezel) but the more money we save on monitors the more LCIII's we canafford and the more PS/2's we can get rid of!Charles KuehmannNorthwestern UniversitySteel Research Groupqman@casbah.acns.nwu.edu

Resolderingthe joints on the motherboard (all of them) fixed it.  Turns outthat continuous heating and cooling caused annular (ring-shaped)cracks to develop in the solder, effectively cutting the videocircuitry off.

 17Last week's MacWEEK article by Ric Ford indicated that David Ramsey'sMac IIx has been running nicely with a Mac IIci ROM in it, offeringclean 32-bit ROM code (liberating his IIx from the virtual memorynightmare caused by Apple's 32-bit System Enabler).Does anyone know of a source for these ROMs?  Is it okay for aremanufacturer to resell only ROM chips from used machines?  I know thatcopies cannot be made, but it seems to me that it would be okay toresell the original used ROM.  (After all, reselling a used computerinvolves the sale of the ROM anyway, so what's the difference?).Needless to say, I'm interested in purchasing such a ROM.

 23Hi, I just test installed kanjitalk 6.07 on my IIci and got a black screen, a way sick looking mac icon, and when hitting theprogrammers reset, a tone sequence that I guess is the infamous "tones ofdeath." I was able to reboot off a floppy, removed the japanese system, andset up the system folder on the hard drive to get system 7.01 back.Now have no overt problems with the mac.Any idea what caused the tones?  I forget the numbers but 7fff comes to mind.If it is some self diagnostic, why would an older system version catch it,and not 7. ?(I'll be moving up to 7.1 and worldscript by-and-by)Thanks in advance,Hiroki--Hiroki MorizonoDepartment of Biochemistry612.624.4938University of Minnesota612.625.5780 (fax)1479 Gortner Avenuehiroki@limerick.cbs.umn.eduSt Paul MN 55108

 22I too have been watching the IIsi speedup reports and plan to upgrade inthe next few weeks.  The plan I have is to build a small board with a fewdifferent crystals on it and to be able to switch between the differentspeeds using a front pannel switch.  This way I can get the speed whenI want but I can also run at slower (stock) speeds it I experience anycompatability problems with any applications.  I don't expect to be ableto switch clock speeds with the system running, but if I can switchwithout any lock-up problems, then I could switch to 33MHz when neededand put it back to idle (20 MHz) when not needeed.  This would furtherreduce the wear-and-tear on the CPU even with a heat sink.  Of courseI would not want to run the different clock signals through the switchbut use a chip or two on the board to select the frequency desired androute it directly to the mother board.I haven't started probing around inside my si yet.  Does anyone know thevoltage level to power the crystal oscilators?
