 33NNTP-Posting-Host: mailszrz.zrz.tu-berlin.deHi everybody out there,I just got the third beta release disk (march 93) of WindowsNTand still am not able to boot up that system. The final stepachieved is the display of IO-error 0x0069. But, since this isthe beta release of the SDK for NT and not of NT, Microsoft doesnot include a manual on the OS itself, explaining what thiserror means of what I can do to get rid of.

In addition, it altered or eliminated my NWRES2.dll file so that I hadto reinstall my Norton Desktop again.Is there anything I have to know to install it or do I eventually have to ask Lotus to send a working model to me (I heard that they have it)?I just want to see its look and feel before buying it.Any pointer would be greatly appreciated.Thank youHirotomiyoshi@psych.toronto.edu

 35I'm working at a workstation which is usually attached to a Novellnetwork (using shell version 3.22, I think). The workstation, a 386, was setup to run Windows 3.0 with the network about a year ago. Needless to say,I'd like to upgrade it to Windows 3.1, and have it work with the network.Basically, the Windows files'd be on the local hard drive, butseveral DOS applications, like Word Perfect, will be on the network. I'dmainly want Windows to access the network drives, the network printers, andperhaps handle some network functions as well. If I could multitask the DOSapps whose executables are on the network, that'd be great, but I could livewithout it.Eventually, I'd like to get a few other 486s in the office workingwith the network and Windows 3.1 as well. (However, most of the terminalsare 286s, which leaves the network pretty much DOS-bound, and I guess thatleaves out Windows for Workgroups.) And in the future, maybe there'd beNorton desktop, but that's gettingahead of myself.As you can guess, I've never done anything like this before. I'veread through the networks material that came with Windows, but still, I'dlike to know if anyone out there has any experience in such an area.Please reply by Email.

 21I really think you are comparing apples and oranges. Nobody disputesthat OS/2 has more big OS features. The question is Does an individual need the power. The sales of Windows vs OS/2 answer thatquestion. The next question is even if I did want to run OS/2and I had this big monster machine to run it on, is there a diverseset of applications to run on it that allow me to productviely do mywork. Go to your local computer store to answer this one.I think the comparison you need to be doing is NT vs OS2/2.1. Thisis where the new battle lines will be drawn. Windows 3.1 has wonthe single user PC war the next one will be the client serverwar and the entries are NT, OS2/2.1, UNIX and Netware 4.0.Granted these OS's will be eventually scaled down to beattractive to the single user PC and that will probably be phase II'of the war. Who wins only the marketplace will tell but it sure is fun watching and arguing about it tho.Thx Dave L

Yet, Write does>display the font correctly on the screen.This is a common problem with highly complex TrueType fonts.  Microsoftadmits to a problem with older versions of the PostScript printer driver,but I've found it to be pretty generic.You can get around the problem by adjusting the parameter OutlineThresholdin the [TrueType] section of WIN.INI.  This entry specifies the number ofpels-per-em at which Windows will render TrueType fonts as outline fontsinstead of as bitmap fonts.  The default is 256.  I've generally been ableto get fonts to work by setting OutlineThreshold=160.  Depending on yourprinter resolution and the point size you are using, you may need adifferent value.The Windows Resource Kit warns against going above 300.  Presumably, thatmight cause fonts to print as square boxes or something.  :-|  (I'm notsmiling.)--Bob NicholsAT&T Bell Laboratoriesrnichols@ihlpm.ih.att.com

Windows NT (tm)is becomming usable.There are a few things to consider before you make the leap though.First (for me at least) is that you cannot get a full-speed DOS box.What I mean is, I cannot (for instance) run Falcon 3.0 or any otherresourse intensive program in a DOS box.  It absolutley crawls.  And my machine is a 486/33 with a 330MB HD and 16MB RAM.  If anyoneknows how to get a fast DOS box (or full-screen for that matter), please let me know.The second thing is there are still not many drivers around for stuff.For instance, my PAS-16 has been demoted to running as a Sound Blaster(which is natively supported -- nice), because MediaVision hasn't produced drivers yet.Your disk should be large enough to keep an 80MB DOS partition, andgive the rest over to Windows NT (tm).  The only thing is, wheneveryou wanted to run Windows programs, you'd have to reboot and log intoWindows NT (tm), instead of just typing WIN.Windows NT (tm) does seem to be much more stable than normal Windowsthough.  It'd be a good choice if you have the resources.  You shouldreally have *at LEAST* 8MB RAM though.  One last thing, modems workwell enough, but I have yet to get my FAX card to work, and I've neverheard of anyone else who did either.It's only better than UNIX because it runs killer software out of thebox, whereas with UNIX there isn't the same availablity.I guess it comes down to -- Windows NT (tm) is not yet for the faintof heart, it's still a beta.  But it's a very GOOD beta.-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Scott Reimert  \\    reimert@mamacass.etdesg.trw.com     /Standard disclaimer:Redondo Beach, CA \\______________________________________/"Blah blah blah ...

Just because a fax modem behaves likea printer on a "local" machine, doesn't guarantee functionality when a "local" machine has fax software printing to a "remotelyinstalled" fax card.  I tried this with Workgroups and the fax software didn't like it at all.  Could have been WinFAX'speculiarisms but I don't think so.  A lot of special hardwareinteraction takes place internally.  In my case, a FAX managerprogram merely "intercepts" the print job and spools it toit's own directory, not print manager's spool directory.  Tosoftware, it appears the job was "printed".  Print Manager plays NO part in the handling of the actual process.Pardon me if I've incorrectly assumed this is what you wereup to.  A truely network-aware fax-modem will most likely berequired, or a lot of weird setup and tinkering.Good luck.

 52I don't know much about computers, so please bear with me. Here's my question:CONTEXT: I use a package called SLIP on my home computer to connect to the         university mainframe (an IBM 3090 running VMS/MVS), and log on to my         account. When I installed SLIP on my computer, I had to configure it         for my modem (14.4 kbs Etronics internal) and had to supply the phone         number to dial to reach the mainframe. The way it works now is that         I type "telnet uicvm" or "tn3270 uicvm" (either will work) at the DOS         prompt. UICVM is the node name of the mainframe. The program then         dials the mainframe, establishes a protocol, and gives me the logon         screen. "TELNET" and "TN3270" are the names of batch files in my SLIP         directory. I have been told that a kermit protocol is used for the         session.PROBLEM: I would like to be able to do all this under Windows 3.1 because I         hardly ever use DOS directly. SLIP will not run under Windows. I         talked to the people at our computer center, and they suggested that         I use a packet driver called WINPKT.COM with SLIP. They gave me         instructions on how to load it before I start Windows, and how to         modify the TCPSTART and TCPSTOP batch files (in the SLIP directory)         to ensure that it would work. I did all that and I could run SLIP         from Windows, but there were other problems. For one thing, SLIP         would not hang up the phone when I exited. I had to run my communi-         cations program to hang up the phone or reboot the computer when         that didn't work. For another, there were too many errors. It often         took me 3-4 tries to connect to the mainframe. Our computer center         does not support SLIP under Windows, so I can't keep going back to         them with more questions.QUESTION: Is there some other SHAREWARE package that will run under Windows         and do what SLIP is supposed to do? I need a package that is not too         expensive, which is why I am looking for shareware. I have heard that         there are regular commercial packages that do all this, but they cost         hundreds of dollars. These are the main requirements:         1. Must be able to run under Windows 3.1         2. Must allow VT100 and IBM TN3270 terminal emulation         3. Must allow ftp file transfers, since that's the only kind the            mainframe allows. No Y-modem or Z-modem etc. I believe the ftp            transfers are made through a kermit protocol, but I'm hazy about            that.         A subsidiary feature (that would be nice to have) if it's a true         Windows program (rather than a DOS program modified to run under         Windows) is the ability to run the session in a window concurrently         with other applications and to cut and paste between the telnet         session and other applications.Any information received is appreciated.Pankaj Saxenau09416@uicvm.uic.edu

 18  Hi.  One of my coworkers is having a very odd problem.  His mouseworks fine in DOS applications, if you load them from the C: prompt.Under Windows, the mouse pointer is present, but does not move.  Evenif you load a DOS app under Windows, the mouse doesn't work.  The computer is a Zeos 386SX-20 w/Diamond Speedstar VGA running MSDOS 5.0 and Windows 3.1.  Mouse driver is Microsoft's 8.2.  I've triedswitching the mouse from COM1 to COM2, I've tried a different mouse,I've reinstalled MOUSE.DRV, and I can't get the blamed thing to work.The only difference between his system and mine (where the mouse worksperfectly) is that he has an expansion card with an additionalparallel and serial port.  Could that cause the problem?

I have a feeling thatyour problems are not with the card or drivers.  The ATI Ultra drivers areconsidered some of the most reliable on the market, and the SS 24X ones seem quite good as well.  Maybe you should check BIOS problems in yourGateway.  I know a few people with Gateway DX2's, and all of them havefound some problem or other with compatibility -- especially with graphics.The only GPF's I have ever had can be directly attributable to using/abusing applications.  I even got the newest drivers from Diamond when people started complaining.

 34I'm looking for some recommendations for screen capture programs.  Acouple of issues ago, PC Mag listed as Editor's Choices both ConversionArtist and Hijaak for Windows.  Anyone have any experience with those orsome others?  I'm trying to get an alpha manual in the next few days, andI'm not making much progress with the screen shots.  :^( I'm currently using DoDot and I'm about to burn it and the disks it rodeit on.  It's got a lot of freaky bugs and *oversights* that are drivingme crazy.  Tonight it decided that for any graphic it writes out as aTIFF file that's under a certain arbitrary size, it will swap the leftand right sides of the picture [!].  Usually it confines itself to notcopying things to the clipboard (so I have to save and load pix forediting in paintbrush) or crashing every hour or so. The one nice thing it has, though, is it's "dither" option.  You'd thinkthat this would turn colors into dots, which it does if you go from, say,256 colors to 16 colors.  But if you go from 256 or 16 colors to B&W,you can set a threshold level for which colors turn to black and whichturn to white.  For me, this is useful because I can turn light grays onbuttons to white, and the dark grays to black, and thereby preserve the3d-effect on buttons and other parts of the window. If you understood my description :^) can you tell me if another (lessbuggy!) program can do this as well?

 18I have a 486/33 VLB machine, with a Wang 96/24 fax/modem.When using the windows terminal application, the only wayI can get it to 'see' the modem is to change it to COM2,then go back and change it to COM4.  Then it works fine.(I have it set to COM4 as the port to use)  I don't haveanything plugged into COM2, and I've looked over the manualfor all it's worth, but what am I missing?  The modem is jumpered for COM4/IRQ3, which I understand means I can'tuse the second serial port and the modem at the same time,but I'm not using the second serial port anyway.Also, when using Procomm + for DOS, it always sees the modemand dials, but doesn't always connect me when the other endanswers.  Don't know if that helps any.Thanks, Brian D. Reed    bdr@cbnewsg.cb.att.com

 100NNTP-Posting-Host: tamuts.tamu.eduWindows Shareware Monthly (WSM) is an on-line forum for information about thenewest and best Windows 3.x and NT shareware/freeware software. WSM is a compilation of submissions from shareware/freeware authors in a singleWindows .HLP (Help System) file.  All types of software may be submitted forentry in WSM - utilities, applications, games, programming tools, etc.WSM benefits Windows shareware/freeware authors by allowing them to publicizetheir software releases, inform users of updated versions, and to increasetheir installed base of users.  Those searching for specific Windows softwarewill benefit by having a complete list of available software available at theirfingertips - complete with feature lists, current prices, and any otherrelevant information.Windows software authors may submit entries to Windows Shareware Monthly in thefollowing manner:1. Compose a short summary of the function of the software.  Include all   special features which are unique to your product and which set it apart   from other programs in the genre.  Be sure to include specific details   such as: the current release version, where the software is available,   how much the registration fee costs, how much disk space is required, any   special requirements (e.g. sound card, or VBRUN200.DLL, etc.), how the   author may be contacted, etc.  Because text is highly compressible, the   summary may be as long as is necessary, however, it is best to keep it   short.  A good guideline is a single screenful of 12-point text at 640x480   resolution.  Order forms and other such addendum may be included if desired.   All submissions whould be in plain text (ASCII) format.  Formatting will   be exactly as it is submitted - I will simply cut and paste text files   into a Help Authoring system.  If you require special formatting    conventions - such as boldface text or italics, or a larger font size,   indicate so CLEARLY within the text file.  For best results, use Windows   NotePad to create the .TXT file.  2. Include up to 100k of Windows-format .BMP (bitmap) screen-shots which   display the workings or special features of each program.  Special cases   (rendering applications for example) which require 256-color bitmaps may   submit up to 250k of .BMP files - all other should observe the 100k limit   and use 16-color format.  For maximum compatiblity with the software which   will be used to create the WSM .HLP file (Stefan Olson's Help Writer's   Assistant for Windows), please save the bitmaps with Windows Paintbrush or   WinGIF. 3. Include a 16-color .BMP of the program's icon (.ICO file).  Many programs   are available to convert .ICO to .BMP format, or Windows Paintbrush may be   used.  The .BMP will be embedded in the summary text.4. Double-check for spelling errors, formatting corrections, etc.  5. Compress the .TXT file, the .BMP of the program icon, and any additional   .BMPs into a single file using PKZIP (any version).6. Submit the entry by UUENCODING the .ZIPfile, and e-mailing it to:      DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU   if submitting via the Internet or Compuserve. If submitting via America   Online, send a brief message indicating submission, and append the .ZIP   file, then e-mail to:   DiegoAA7. If any changes are required, or a new version is released, complete   the above procedures again.  Send all submissions to the @TAMUTS address,   and any comments, suggestions, criticisms, to DAA7365@RIGEL.TAMU.EDU.All entries received before the deadline will be included in the subsequentedition of WSM.  The editor will not be held responsible for any errors, andwe reserve the right to make changes to the entries.WSM is not limited to shareware/freeware software.  A special area will bedevoted to commercially available Windows 3.x and NT software.  Commercialsoftware authors should follow the same steps above, with the exception ofthe limitations on size - the .TXT file and .BMPs may be as large as required(and as large as is practical for transmission over phone lines).  Thereis no charge for the publishing of either shareware/freeware or commercialproduct entries.  Advertisements for computer hardware, software, bulletin boards, etc. maybe submitted as well. Again, the same procedures apply, with the exception ofthe size limitations.  There is no charge for advertising space.  The firstten advertisements submitted each month will be included; subsequentsubmissions will not be included due to size constraints.WSM is currently looking for persons willing to devote the time to authorcolumns within WSM.  A C/C++ programing section, a Visual Basic section, andtwo Windows-specific opinion/advice columns are envisioned.  All work willbe on a voluntary basis.  If you wish to aid WSM and author a monthly columnon one of the above topics, please send us mail at DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU orDiegoAA on America Online. The first edition of WSM will be distributed May 1st via America Online,Compuserve, and the Internet.  The deadline for submissions is April 28th.The first edition filename will be WSM-1.ZIP, with each subsequent monthlyrelease continuing in the series naming convention (WSM-2.ZIP, etc.).  Eachedition will be released on the first of each month, and the deadline forsubmission will be at least three days before release.

 36I've been using Final from CODA for some time, but suddenly it stopped using my fonts. I have a 386 PC with lots of disk space and memory, a Postscript laser, Win3.1, Finale 2.0.1 and I recently installed ATM 2.0. I've been fiddling around with the Windows setup for some time, and when I needed to do some work with Finale things didn't print properly. It might - and it might not - have anything to do with the installation of ATM from 1.something to 2.0, but I don't have the old ATM lying around anomore. The most annoying problem was that the Petrucci font didn't print, which is a rather important font :-) I managed to get direct printing to work if I included OwnPS=0 in the [Finale] section of WIN.INI, but Compile PostScript Listing still doesn't work; and it's those .EPS files I need. When I look at the .eps files generated the only font which appears there is Courier. I found out that if I manually changed the Courier 24-point to Petrucci 24-point in the .EPS file everything worked ok, but I'd rather avoid that since I have a lot of songs to work with. And yes, in the Special/Font/Font names dialog box all the fonts I need are listed, with the correct mapping between Finale, Screen and Printer fonts. Finale is obviously aware of the fonts since direct printing of a score works well (that is, after I included OwnPS=0), and all my other Windows applications print Petrucci and the other fonts well. Has anyone encountered problems like this? What is the current version of Finale from Coda Music Software? I have 2.0.1Are the people at Coda available on Internet or X.400?I'd be grateful for all hints and help.                                -mats-- Internet: mats@gar.no       QuikComm: mats@gar#@genor       ServerP: mats garpX.400:    g=Mats; s=Tande; o=Oslo; p=GR; A=Telemax; C=NO;

 65I'd like to appeal to the net's NT wizards for a bit of advice.First a general description of the machine as follows: Motherboard: Utron 33 mhz Opti chipset, 20 meg memory, 256kb cache      (soon I hope to drop a DX2 chip into it) Fahrenheit 1280 video (1 meg, 1024x768x256) ProAudio Spectrum 16 sound board primary disk = Connor CP30174 on a caching IDE controller secondary disk = Conner CP30174 as slave on same controller tertiary disk = Fujitsu ??? 650 meg on Superstore ESDI controller planned future disks include SCSI HD and CD ROM on PAS16 SCSI port Tape drive is a Colorado Jumbo 250 on the Floppy controller  future tape drive may be a DAT on the SCSI interface. Other hardware includes modem/fax, serial ports, and a teletext board (ugly dos software drives the latter)Applications used include normal windows stuff (excel, word, Quickenand Turbo Pascal/Windows) but the important stuff is my Audiowork environment which includes Turtle beach Wave for Windows, MCS Stereo,and other misc stuff for dinking around with audio files.  Also I useStacker on the primary drive, HP Newwave (for my wife's use, and she won't let me get rid of it!), and a product called Infinite Disk from Chili Pepper Software for hierarchical storage management of my seldom used offline files.  I plan to upgrade to NT, when it becomes a released product.  I was stonglytempted to become a beta user early on, but I don't have time to mess aroundwith the hassles of beta software.  I expect to buy it, tear off the shrink wrap, and use it without hassle (I know, unrealistic, but I canhope can't I, after all, I have work to do).The advice I want concerns the state of NT regarding device drivers, and hardware specific stuff in general.  How smoothly can I expect the upgrade to go?  Can I expect support for all my stuff, or do Istill need to scramble around downloading drivers (PAS?, Orchid?, Colorado?) from some bbs, etc.  What steps should I take to ensure the installationgoes smoothly.  Note that I want to nuke dos totally from the system.  I'mallergic to command lines!  I plan to run a "pure" NT system.  Also, will NT communicate with the workgroups lan?  What about stacker?  I currently have stacker on the first disk drive.  Without Stacker, and the Infinite Disk product, I will have great difficulty fitting everything I have on the system (It's cramped now).I realize Stacker will be incompatible with NT, but will there be an NT version?  Or will NT support compression a la Dos 6?  I know Infinite Diskwill be incompatible with NT, but will they offer (or does anybody else)a comparable product for NT and at what cost?  (perhaps I need to ask Chili Pepper that question)  I can live without ID if I have to, but I'drather not.  Will NT run my DOS apps (the teletext board mainly) withoutDOS on the system?  What do I need to keep around?Any feedback or advice (including "forget NT" with good reasons) is muchappreciated.  My only significant reason for moving to NT is I need a bettermultitasking environment than Windows (among other reasons, WAVE locks upthe machine for hours and hours doing DSP processing on large audio files),and I want better lan support than I now have (Internet access, etc).  Maybethere are better solutions than NT and if so, I would appreciate hearing about them (OS/2?  What's it's status these days?)Pls respond by email and if there is interest I'll summarize for the net.Thanks,Nathan Gregoryp00211@psilink.com
 46NNTP-Posting-Host: bpavms.bpa.arizona.eduNews-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41    This may be an FAQ (if so, please direct me to the known answer) but I    am getting frustrated and looking for help.    I am running Win 3.1 with NDW 2.2 on a 486sx with 8 meg of memory and a    6 meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my    applications are not giving back system resources when I close them.    When I load windows I start with about 83% resources available but many    of the application programs I run regularly (WPWIN 5.2, VB 2.0, WINQVT    2.8, Lotus Organizer, etc.) seem to not return all their resources when    I exit them.  After a day or two of work I often find myself down under    50% of available resources even when I have no applications other than    my shell running.    I am aware this is a known problem; what I am looking for are some    suggestions of what I might do to mitigate it.      1. What software is the culprit?  Win 3.1, NDW, my applications?  Are    some modes of Win 3.1 (standard, real, enhanced) better than others at    plugging this leak?    2. Are their system.ini switches i can set to help plug this leak?    3. Do people know of patches or third party software that help with    this?  Seems like increasing or better managing system resources is a    great market for a third party memory company like QEMM.    4. If I run Progman instead of NDW will the leak subside?  (I was    hoping that NDW 2.2 would have plugged this, but it seems no different    than 2.0 in how it deals with memory and resources.)    5. When I am writing VB code are there things I can do to make it less    likely my code will eat resources?    6. Any other suggestions that I don't know enough to ask for    specifically?    Thanks for your help.  As this is a common problem and I have seen only    a little discussion of it on the net there are probably others who    would like to read answers so please publish here rather than sending    me email.    danny===========================================================================daniel david mittleman     -     danny@arizona.edu     -     (602) 621-2932

 24Has anyone had problems with Ami Pro 3.0 after running PCTools (v7.1)compress?  I have not corrupted data due to having caches other thanPC-Cache running, so that is not it.  The first time I try to run AmiPro after loading windows, it loads, but causes (I think it was a) segmentation fault in AMIPRO.EXE right before it finishes, with all timesafter that only managing to get to the logo box that first pops up whenit begins loading, and then causes a general protection fault in moduleAMIPROUI.DLL at 0002:1147.  I have not been able to fix this problem exceptby reinstalling Ami Pro.  This has happened twice, with both times beingafter having ran compress on my hard drive.  BTW, I am not running stackeror any other disk compression programs, and if you don't already know,PCTools compress is actually a defragger, despite it's name.  My system isa 386-40MHz, with 16MB of RAM and a NEC (OEM) hard drive, etc, but thatshouldn't make a difference.PLEASE email me as I can't keep up with the newsgroup, and it will cut downon net traffic anyways.

Whenever I save an icon which contains darkcolors like dark red or dark purple, these colors are converted to thebright colors. This happens with every icon editor including the imageeditor that came with SDK. I don't have this problem with .BMP fileseither; only with .ICO files or icon libraries. The problem is withthe icon colormap field in the icon file header. Checking the filewith a binary editor, I can see that the masks are OK. By editing thecolormap manually (copying from another icon that I didn't edit) I canfix the colors. Does anybody know what may be causing this problem?

That bug is still present, however...Now: the problem I have is that my DeskJet 550 print driver (came withthe printer I bought in December) still wants to print the envelops inPORTRAIT mode.  However, the DeskJet 550 feeds envelops the from thenarrow end (i.e. landscape mode).  How do I get the printer to printthe envelops in the correct orientation?PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not post this to the net since:    (a) due to end of the semester cruch, I can't keep up on these groups,and (b) I will summarize the best answer(s) to the net anyhow!Thanks in advance,Craig Stevenson

The Ultra Pro was nearly asfast in text handling, but was blown away in the CAD and Paint tests.As an additional test, we hand-timed a complex CorelDraw! slide resize/-redraw times.  There was no swapping, but I'd expect there is a fairlyheavy load on the CPU.  The Graphite redraw times averaged about 10.2seconds, with ATI Ultra Pro at 12.0.  This jives with Steve Gibson'scontention that the ISA Graphite is faster than an ATI UP on his complexMicrografx Draw document.So far, I'm *very* impressed.  The drivers look solid, and the card flies.The installation and utilities are different, but comparable to ATI's.  AndI didn't have to wait for Build 59 for some reliability...

 6Nntp-Posting-Host: trapdoor.spider.co.ukOK will some one out there tell me why / how DOS 5can read (I havn't tried writing in case it breaks something)the Win/NT NTFS file system.I thought NTFS was supposed to be better than the FAT systemkeith
 16I've started getting a message from Windows 3.1 whenever I try to executea DOS program from Windows, either thru the Program Manager or the FileManager. A message box comes up and says "This program or one of itscomponents is compressed. Use the MS-DOS expand command to expand thefile."Now, I know this is bogus, because I can always execute the programfrom DOS when not running windows. The program in question is COMMAND.COM(yup, the basic DOS command line shell...) And, the expand command tellsme that the file is already expanded.All my windows apps work just fine - I only get this message when tryingto execute a DOS program from Windows.Clues anyone?  Thanks!!   Christopher Wroten, cfw@world.std.com

All of this is pretty riskystuff in a PC environment.>The straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the /f option to >fix the disk and then it looks like I would probably have to reinstall Windows>and a few other things.A reasonably accurate prediction...Here's a brief description of how DOS stores files:There are three pieces to a file.  The directory entry, the FAT chain,and the data area.  You can think of these as a sheet of linednotebook paper, a sheet of graph paper, and a stack of 3X5 cards.The directory entry (notebook paper) holds the file name, actual size,and first cluster number.  It also holds some other information that's notimportant right now.The File Allocation Table (FAT) chain (graph paper) tells where to findthe actual data.  Each square of graph paper holds a number.  If thenumber is zero, the cluster associated with this box is available.  If itholds a "magic" number, it is either the last piece of a file or a bad(unuseable) spot on the disk.  Any other number tells which clustercontains the next section of the file.The data area (3X5 cards) is where the actual information is stored.The data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size; storage isdoled out in "chunks" of one cluster each.  (In your case, one clusteris 2048 bytes.)  As a cluster is filled, another is allocated.To read a file, you first look at the directory entry to get thestarting cluster number.  Now you read the data from that cluster.Next, look at the FAT entry for the cluster you just read.  This willtell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file.Naturally, these numbers are usually sequential, but they can jumparound and even go backwards.  Continue reading, one cluster at atime, as you walk this chain through the FAT, until you hit the markerwhich says it's the last cluster in the file.CHKDSK is the DOS utility that checks the sanity and coherence ofthe directories and the FAT and can bludgeon most flaws intosubmission.  It doesn't have any intelligence, so you have todouble-check anything it "fixes".Now let's do a bit of a post-mortem:>C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\CVPIC.EXE>C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\VPIC.TXT>C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\VIDEO7.CFG>C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\ORCPRO2.CFG>C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\VGA.CFG>C:\\GAME\\GOOSE\\BIRD2.X>C:\\WINMISC\\ADV21\\WINADV.EXE>   Allocation error, size adjustedAll of these files have sizes (according to the FAT) which don't matchthe size reported in their directory entries.  CHKDSK /F will alterthe directory entries to match the FAT size.  (In other words,   thedirectory entry for CVPIC.EXE may say the file is 64,877 bytes long.But CHKDSK found a FAT chain of 43 clusters attached to it.  (My numbers,obviously, are made up.))>   316 lost allocation units found in 224 chains.>    647168 bytes disk space would be freedDisk space was found which is allocated in the FAT, but is not attachedto any directory entry.  CHKDSK /F gives you the option of converting these"lost chains" to files.  You can then examine the files (FILE0000.CHKthrough FILE0223.CHK) and rename or discard them.  Or, if you tellCHKDSK _not_ to convert them to files, then those clusters will simplybe marked "available" in the FAT.>C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\CVPIC.EXE>   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16133...>C:\\386SPART.PAR>   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16133These files are both referencing the _same_ data cluster.  Obviously,one of them (at least) must be wrong.  It's interesting to note thatC:\\386SPART.PAR is your Windows swap file...To fix this, you should copy each cross-linked file to a new name.This will "fix" the cross-link by giving the files unique data spaces.Now delete the cross-linked files.  Examine the copies and try toassemble them properly.  Good luck.  (Hint:  "Missing pieces" arelikely to be found in those "lost chains" at the top...)>  42366976 bytes total disk space>   3958784 bytes in 4 hidden files>    153600 bytes in 67 directories>  36042752 bytes in 1496 user files>   1564672 bytes available on diskYour disk is pretty close to full.  This may be the actual cause ofthe problem; perhaps Windows needed to expand its swapfile by anamount which exceeded available disk space...In any case, the short summary is that something trashed your FAT.There are utilities that can mirror your FAT and help repair damageafter something like this, but you have to run them _before_ theproblem occurs.

This is crazy!  I have >never had so much trouble with a mouse before.  Anyone have any solutions?  Try this:  flip your mouse over, and open up the cover that holds themouse ball in place.  Remove the ball, and inside you should see(probably) 3 rollers.  If any of the rollers have a tiny layer ofcaked-on dirt, dust, or otherwise unidentifiable scum on them, carefullyscrape it off with a small knife (Xacto works great).  *Be Careful*You do not want to gauge the rollers, just clean off the dirt.Put the ball back in, put the cover on, and there you are.  I clean a couple of dozen of these every month here.  Another symptomis that when you move the mouse, it seems to "click" along.  If thisdoesn't solve your problem, at least you have a clean mouse.  I highlyrecommend using a proper _soft_ mouse pad, and if you are a clean freak,place it in your drawer every night or when you don't use it to keepthe dust off.Personally I prefer track balls.  Oh, which brings me to another point:if your mouse or trackball tracks optically, and the sunlight is streaming through the window onto your mouse/trackball, you may noticethat it will stop working.  If this happens to you, close the curtainsor blinds, or simply shade your pointing device, and see if that helps.--  Peter Goudswaard                  _________                     _________ goudswaa@sfu.ca (preferred)      |         |      __/^\\__      |         | pgoudswa@cln.etc.bc.ca           |         |      \\     /      |         | pgoudswa@cue.bc.ca               |         |   _/\\_\\   /_/\\_   |         |                                  |         |   >           <   |         | "There's no gift like the present"         |    >_________<    |         |    - Goudswaard's observation    |_________|         |         |_________|

But for me it is true.  Windows crashed onall of the time (and from what I have read in PC Mag, this is not the exception).  OS/2 gives each windows app a VDM and they can't touch each other or(generally) anything they aren't supposed to have.  If windows works for you,then great.  Maybe this is why some people don't see why OS/2 is the OS of choice.  If windows doesn't crash on you, and you don't mind waiting on eachtask, and not being able to adress your memory better than DOS, some of thekey reasons for using OS/2 are gone.  I probably  would still use it, but itwould be more of an even fight.Brett -- Brett D.

MaybePC Magazine, January 12, 1993 had a review of several personal financemanagement programe, as did PC-Computing, January 1993.  PC World,December 1992 also had articles about Quicken and Managing Your Money.I can email you copies of these articles if you can't find them at yourlibrary.I've been using Managing Your Money for several years, and I haveseveral friends who use Quicken, though I've not used it myself.  Myoverall impression is that Quicken is a financial accounts managerwhile Managing Your Money will help you more completely manage yourfinances.Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money and Quicken share:The ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts:checking, savings, charge, cash, or brokerage.  You can reconcileyour account statements with the records the program keeps.The ability to make a budget and track your spending against thatbudget.A Checkfree module which will allow you to use the Checkfree billpaying service to pay your bills via your modem.The ability to print checks on your printer.The ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments.The ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accountsup to date.  I know Managing Your Money can do this automaticallyvia modem.  Quicken probably can as well, but I'm not sure about it.The ability to export tax information to popular tax preparationprograms.Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money has thatQuicken does not:A tax prediction module.  This looks at your accounts and budget topredict your tax liability for the coming year.  It's usefull to finetune your withholding so Uncle Sam doesn't get his due too early.An insurance and vital records module.  This is a place to keeprecords of your insurance policies as well as other vital records.It can also compute your life expectancy.A financial analysis module.  This computes compound interest, effects of inflation, loan payments term or interest, yield tomaturity for bonds, savings account yields, days between dates, andloan amortization schedules.  It also has functions to help you decide whether to refinance your mortgage, whether you can afforda particular home, whether a particular rental property is a goodinvestment, whether you should buy lease or rent, and whethera particular investment's cash flow is adequate for your situation.This module can also help you plan for retirement and for helpingyour kids with their tuition.  A net worth module.  This is a place to record all your assetsand liabilities.  Your net worth can be computed from this information.  Any assets or liabilities recorded in other modulesare automatically included here.A "desk" module.  This includes a small word processor, a card fileyou can use to store names, addresses, phone numbers and other vitalinformation about friends and associates, a perpetual calander, arudimentary calculator, a to-do list, a reminder list, an appointmentlist, and a place to record your phone calls (for those who need totrack such things).  Your appointments, reminders and to-do listcan be made to display automatically when you start the program.There are probably some things listed above that Quicken has, but I'm almostsure that Quicken doesn't do everything I've listed.  If I'm wrong, I'm surehordes of Quicken devotees will flame me to a crisp.One thing that Quicken has that Managing Your Money does not yet have is a Windows version.  MECA software is rumored to be working on a Windows versionof Managing Your Money for release late this year.I hope this information is of use to you.  I've found Managing Your Money tobe a very usefull program for keeping my financial records.  On the other handI know many people who are equally as happy with Quicken.  If Quicken has allthe features you need or want, I'd go with it. If you find any of the ManagingYour Money features that Quicken doesn't have to be useful, I think it's wellworth the price.

 15Help!I am working on a project that involves using text with foreign languagecharacters (in this case Norwegian). I have been manipulating the datawith Excell 4.0 and then exporting the data as comma seperated variablefiles to an RS6000 workstation.  The Norwegian characters show up fineunder Windows, but appear as "funny" characters on the workstation.  Theworkstation is setup for national language support and we have problementering the Norwegian characters from the workstation keyboard. On further investigation I found that the character codes used byWindows are different (for these characters) than those specified by theMSDOS code page.  The MSDOS codes seem to be the same as theworkstation.  What gives, and how can get around it.Please reply by E-mail as I will be out of the office the next few daysand will not be reading the news.Thanks.

Windows will use a swap filelarger than the recommended size.  Last summer I went to a MicrosoftWindows 3.1 Technical Workshop and they distributed A LOT of informationthat the general public might not be aware of.  Anyway in the main bookthey handed out they have a section on "Creating larger than recommendedswapfile".  I'll quote the information  If you create a permanent swapfile larger than the recommended size, you  will receive a message telling you that Windows will not use anything  larger than the recommended size.  THIS ERROR MESSAGE IS INCORRECT, we  will allow the use of the larger swapfile, up to four times the amount  of RAM on your machine.So as you see, Microsoft does know that the information is incorrect.  Youprobably just ran into some doofball who was new on the job and was onlytelling you what little he knew.Be that what it may, I would really suggest to everyone to take theopportunity to go to these Technical Workshops.  They aren't actuallyincredibly in-depth, but you do get a lot of material about bugs andoptimization straight from those in the know.  Besides that they offeryou HUGE discounts on software.  If I remember correctly, you could pickup Word 2.0, Excel 4.0, or whatever their presentation program is for $130.That is the full blown version, not an upgrade or educational version.  Youcould also pick up Microsoft Office for $500 or something like that.  MyselfI sprang for Word.Well, hope that was helpful to someone.

 34[ Lots of stuff deleted because I felt like it ]This MS bashing has definitely lost all its humor value.I think most of the people posting are forgetting that most usersof MS products do not even know about internet, and Unix is thatvery unfriendly place where bizzare abreviations replace the rathercomfortable abreviations they know. And the abreviations have subtledifferences between the different vendors. While PC users tend tocustomize any windowing setup, they can not do much with their command line.So to most of the computer users in the world MS product symbolizequality. MS has made their life easier, and more productive and to themthat is quality. They do not care about what innovative things MS hasdone, other than to make their life with a computer one heck of a loteasier. You may know better than most computer users in this worldbut that will not change their perception.Face it until Unix come up with a decent GUI that is available toall variations of Unix it just will not catch on with the mainstreamof computer users. We here on the net are not mainstream computer users.Brian-- Disclaimer: The opinions expressed are mine not those of BNR. ____________________________________________________________________________| Brian, WS1S (ST/TT User/Developer) |  If I wanted a computer to play games || Bell Northern Research             |  on I'd buy an Amiga.

 47        I am having something very unusual happen.  First some background on my system.  I have a Mitsubishi 63 meg Hard Drive, and am running Smartdrv (the version that comes with Windows 3.1) on it.  I rarely use Windows.  I use a program called Disk Technician Gold v1.14 to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive.  It works by having a device driver detect whenever more than one read is necessary for a file, or if there is anything else is wrong with it, and minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting.  My hard drive is notorious for bad sectors.  I usually end up with 8 new bad sectors a week.         Here's what happened:  I ran a program, and DTG broke in with an Emergency Warning and recommended I reboot.  It gave me this message twice before the program was fully loaded.  I exited the program and did just this.  DTG went through its bootup process, examining for new errors etc., and a screen popped up and said something about sectors for a brief period of time.         I then went back to the program, executed it again, and the exact same error was detected.  I rebooted and tried again, and the same error happened again.  So, I removed DTG from memory, and went to the program to see if I could detect anything wrong.  Sure enough there was a number of read attempts.  So I rebooted and reloaded DTG, but removed the cache.  I executed the program.  No read errors, either audible or detected by DTG.  I quit the program, loaded the cache, and ran the program again.  The errors were detected.         Ok, so the errors are there, and DTG detects but doesn't fix them, when the cache is loaded.  When the cache is not loaded there are no errors.  So, to see if the cache was interfering with any other files, I went into xtree gold and tagged all files, and searched them for a random string (in other words, I wanted the program to completely read every file on my hard drive).  Before I got through the c's DTG had detected at least six errors and recommended I reboot.         Does anybody, have any idea why Smartdrv is causing misreads on my hard drive?  Oh, there are exactly two misreads per file, and 1 in about every 100 files are affected.           I originally posted this message to Disk Technician Corp.'s system, but I figured someone out in netland may know enough about smartdrv to help me out.--                    INTERNET:  jdriver@netlink.cts.com (John Driver)UUCP:   ...!ryptyde!netlink!jdriverNetLink Online Communications * Public Access in San Diego, CA (619) 453-1115

 18I just installed a new TrueType font under MS-Windows 3.1but though all the applications display the font correctly on thescreen, quite a few of them fail to print out the document correctly(on a LaserJet 4 - non-PostScript printer).When I use the font in CorelDRAW, the document prints correctly, so I assumeCorelDRAW knows that the font has to be downloaded to the printer.But when I use the Windows accessory Write, the printer prints squareboxes in place of the characters of the new font. Yet, Write doesdisplay the font correctly on the screen.I looked through all the Windows and LaserJet manuals, but got nowhere.All of them just make the statement that TrueType fonts will printexactly as you see them on the screen---so I assume Windows knows that a fonthas to be downloaded automatically---but, how to make it do that????Appreciate any help....

I'm glad we (MS) are startingto remedy this situation with DOS 6 (and it will get better in future releases). You do need to be aware of some history, however. In the mid-late 80's, MS's point of view was that OS/2 was going to take overthe world and DOS would be phased out. As such, resources for DOS(and windows, for that matter) development were mostly redirected to OS/2.The theory was to keep just enough resources on DOS to support peopleuntil they started using OS/2, so utilities and such for DOS fell by the wayside.Then Windows 3.0 hit the market, OS/2 flopped (1.x, at least...2.x seems tobe doing a little better, but its future is still cloudy), and people eitherstayed with their DOS (3.x and 4.x) apps or moved to Windows. About thatpoint in time, MS made its decision to drop OS/2 for DOS/Windows in theshort term and Windows/NT in the long term. DOS 5, much improved over DOS3.x and 4.x, was the first result of MS's refocussing on DOS and Windows.Version 6 takes things somewhat further and I suspect future versions willoffer even more in terms of "real" OS features (I work on NT and have noreal clue about what my coworkers over in DOSland are doing, but I doknow that there are a heck of a lot more of them than there were afew years ago)....DaveOf course these are my opinions. If you want MS's opinions, as a PR person.

 14NNTP-Posting-Host: ibm.rz.uni-passau.deWalther,I'd have a look at the maximum resolution the combination of the video cardand screen would have without flickering. I'd only suggest using the colorscreen if it does 800*600 without flickering. If this is not too small foryour tastes at a 14"....Personally I'd prefer the mono-screen as I always have quite a few windowsopen. If you only run one program at a time or rarely switch maybe thecolor 'surplus' is worth trading in  the smaller size. If you want todevelop programs you will always have to check the colors. I used a14" mono screen (worst of both worlds) and was surprised how the colors lookedI choose on a color screen. Regards,Olaf Winkelhake

 28We have a LAN where we are doing development on product for multiple platforms. For the moment we are only working on MAC and DOS/Windows. The department has   always used sneaker net to transport files to the MAC, since it requires a      filter to strip out the <LF> characters.                                        Until recently no one concidered using any version control to mediate, and as   a result, the 5 programmers spent a great deal of time merging files together   at the end of each week so that a new system could be build. We are now trying  to streamline this process, but are hampered by the lack of software that will  allow us to share files across PC and MAC platforms.                            I understand that PVCS used to do this, but that they no longer support the MAC product (anyone know why ??  Polytron ?).                                       I have seen people ask about development in multiple platforms, so I assume thatours is not a new problem.  Who has had to deal with it ?  What solutions have  you come up with?                                                               thanks in advance for any and all suggestions via posting or EMAIL.

It lets youvew files, unzip only selected files, and even puts the files in a/checkout directory, and creates a "checkout" .grp and group if you wantto check the program out.  It even prompts for deletion of these onexit, if you didn;t like the program.*HOWEVER* (big however over here).  I have problems zipping.  I don'tkonw specifics on this, or ammount of consistency, but sometimes when I"zip" a few files, or add a file to a .zip, dos will violate somethingor other, and I'll be asked (in a kind, micro$oft kind of way) to quitall applications, quit windows, and restart my computer.  I don't know(as I said) how consistent this is, as I jdont' zip much (and when I do,now I just go to dos and use it from there, or just use the "run" cmd)but I *do* know it's happened when I added files to an existing .zipfile, *and* when I created a new .zip file, using selected files only.I don't know if it's happened when I zip an entire dir.Still, it has a rather nice interface, and quite useful "unzip"ingfunctions.  If the above is fixed, I'll be the first to register the newver.

That is the purpose of life.Like it or not stock prices and sales of a particular product ARE measuresof success. They can be measures of short term or long term success. I thinkin MS case they are a good measure of their long term success. The originalpost mentioned how it seems on this group that there are a large numberof people attacking MS and not willing to accept anything positive about MS.I was trying to make a point that the attacks are over emphasized and tolook at the sales of MS products they definitely tell a different story.I also think a large number of the attackers or debaters as you callthem are highly technical. Look around in the real world people don't wantto GREP and AUCK and ls -l they just want to push the buttons and get their job done on a reasonably priced piece of hardware that does not need a computer smart guy to load configure etc etc. Like it or not MS and themultitudes of business applications that exist to run under Windows doesthis and does it WELL.

I felt for the money my NEC 5FG that I use at work was a much better monitor.The NEC is sharper, flatter, less distorted, and more stable.  I have heard complaints from people about the NEC FG series having some quality control problems but mine has been in use for about a year with no problems at all.There was nothing really broken with the Viewsonic but overall it did not match up.  I used my ATI Graphics Ultra in setup mode to push the frequencies to their limits and the Viewsonic exhibited some problems that the NEC did not.  I personally like the non-etched NEC with the OCLI filter and the tube on the 17 was not as nice.  The 17 had some uncorrectable pincusion and edge distortion problems.  Also, it would change brightness when I switched modes and I was constantly having to fiddle with the controls.  And the yoke was crooked and I had no way to compensate for the raster that tilted downhill.  On the postive side, although not as handsome as the NEC, the 17 had a smaller footprint and was not as heavy.I have heard that Panasonic owns Viewsonic and the model 17 is being sold through OEM channels with a Panasonic label on it.  If it's available that way at a lower cost I could get more serious about it.  For now the NEC has my vote but I'm searching for one of the new, cheaper, NEC 5FGe's to see if it's just as good as its older brother the 5FG before I decide which one to buy.I have no experience with the Nanao.

 18I've been running Dos 6 for about a month.  I was generally impressed withthe improvements:  the multiple boot configurations were great, thenew commands were nice, and DoubleSpace worked fine (twice as slow forlarge data transfers, twice as fast for small with SmartDrv).Until now.This morning at 4 am while I was working on my research paper, I had toreboot a hung Dos program (that did no disk i/o) from within Windows 3.1.When my machine finished rebooting, I found my windows directory and about twothirds of my other directories were irreversibly corrupted.I cannot afford problems like this.  I'm returning to Dos 5.markP.S.  I've also noticed bad sector errors from DoubleSpace where none should      exist.
 110I would like to see a serious discussion on the best way to install windowsfrom a Novell administrator's point of view. I just got off the phone with MS Access support and was told that they(Microsoft) has decided to implement, as a standard for software support,the LOCAL setup (described below) as the "most advantageous installation".If this is true and Microsoft deems this to be the most prudent installationthen I will comply but I'd like to hear it from administrators first. The LOCAL Windows Installation:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Windows is fully installed on each workstation hard drive (assuming theresources are available).  From a network administrator's implementation,he/she would install all windows disks on a network drive using SETUP/A.Then install windows on a per/machine bases by running SETUP off the networkto install the complete system on the local drives.  In this way, all driversare available to the SETUP procedure w/o the need to change disks. Advantages:- Reduce Traffic - Running Windows locally reduces network traffic due to  the local access of main Windows files.- Network independence - If the network fails (and they all do at one point  or another), the local installation would allow users to keep producing  and reduce the cost of down-time.- Faster Windows - Theoretically, Windows will run faster from a local hard  drive than over a network.  This may be a hard point to prove if the network  has an optical backbone and/or the network drives are significantly faster  access than local ones.- A user traveling from machine to machine does not need to worry about  varying setups (monochrome, color, types of mouse, etc...) since the  Windows installation is assigned to the Workstation. Disadvantages:- Cost - Installing Windows locally requires a significant amount of disk  space.  Workstations now must be purchased with a hard disk that can  increase the cost of the workstation from 10 to 30 percent.- Administration - Local windows installations are very difficult toadminister.  New drivers for peripherals are constantly being made available, each of  which would have to be individually installed on each workstation.- Security - Users now have access to erase or corrupt their own system  files from simple ignorance.  This could result in quite a headache for  administrators who may have to constantly repair damaged installations.- Backup - We all know the problems backing up local hard disks.  The backup  sets (if done via a centralized tape system) get very large very quickly.  Backup individually (to floppy) may not happen at all.  This may be  eliminated if it is assumed that local hard disks only contain replaceable  applications and *not* user data. The SHARED Windows Installation~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Windows is fully installed to a network disk via the SETUP/A proceduredescribed above.  Users (or administrators) then install a minimal set offiles to individual "user" directories.  These directories may be on alocal hard disk or perhaps a network "home" directory.  The bulk of theWindows system files are maintained on the network in a single directory(some 400+ files) and are accessed (shared) as-needed by users throughouttheir Windows session.  The user's files consist of a small set of filesthat the user has updated during his/her Windows session.  These includegroup files, .INI files and other regularly updated files. Advantages:- A single location for all files makes updates to drives easy.  As  an updated driver becomes available, it only needs to be installed in this  single directory for all users to be able to take advantage of it.- Assuming that the users' files are maintained in network (home) directories,  the administrator can easily edit any .INI file as-needed to correct  problems that may arise.  This includes WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI.- Backup of all pertinent files is done easily.  Even if the users' files  are on a local hard disk, the bulk of the Windows system is backed up with  all driver updates. Disadvantages:- Network traffic - since all Windows files are being shared in a network  directory, traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the  speed of Windows.- If the network crashes, all production comes to a stop since Window's  is reliant upon the network for its files.  Loss of data usually occurs  as well since users working in Windows at the time of the crash will  usually not be able to save their work.- Although minimal, disk space is still a consideration.  If the users' files  are maintained on the network, a large number of users can cause a  significant utilization of disk space due to their personal Windows  files alone.- Users cannot easily move from machine to machine unless the workstation  hardware are similar.  This is due to the Windows installation being  tied to a particular username (in the case of Network user files).  The Discussion~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I would like to know, from other administrators with a large Windowsuserbase, how they prefer setting up Windows.  Personally, I havesetup numerous installations using the SHARED setup.  All Windows andapplication files are on the network with little or no utilization oflocal hard disks.  In fact, I sold a network on the fact that thecompany would no longer need to purchase hard disks for their workstationsand thus save that much more money. I would also like to see recommendations for applications.  Shouldapps such as Word and/or Excel be installed locally regardless of howWindows is installed?  Again, I keep all files on the network for easybackup and administration but this is "putting all eggs in one basket";if the network crashes, work comes to a halt. Now I am sure Microsoft (and I know your out there) has their ownideas about this and their insights would be of great value but I hope tohear from people with "actual" working experience with users and networkadministration.

If I use AUTO withEMM386, the system hangs on bootup.Dave.-- -------------------------------------------------------------------David Clarke   ...the well is deep...wish me well...ac151@Freenet.carleton.ca  David_Clarke@mtsa.ubc.ca  clarkec@sfu.ca-------------------------------------------------------------------

I was using the Celtic True type which has the accented characters, and used insert symbol to put in in the document.  However, when I put it in the doc, I get a big square character, and then it prints out just the same (to my dismay, thinking that was just the way it worked).Can anyone tell me if and how they have printed Spanish characters?  I know WP 5.1 has this built-in, but I do not recall ever seeing this option on WFW2.  HELP!  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  | Robert S.

 25I have heard many things about the ATI Ultra Pro card. Some havebeen positive but most are negative. Could people please confirmthese?  (I am interested in the EISA version in particular).1) The card does not work in a system with 32M RAM.2) The card works in a 32M system with some switches   set but it is much slower.3) The card is _interlaced_ in its 24bit (true-colour) modes.4) The latest build 59 drivers still do not work in many   cases.5) This card is the fastest full colour card for the money.6) This card is the greatest thing since sliced bread. ;-)Thanks for your feedback.

 35To all hardware and firmware gurus:My current home project is to build a huge paddle keyboard for a physically handicapped relative of mine.  My goal is for this keyboardto look exactly like an AT sytle keyboard to its host system.This will be a highly endowed keyboard with a Little PCL from Z Worldat its heart.  The only thing I lack is detailed information on thehardware signaling that the 486 (with  Windows 3.1  and DOS 5.0) will be expecting.  My project is independant of Windows, my hope is that some ofyou fellow Window's users/programmers will recognize what I need and be willing to point me in the right direction. I have The Winn L. Rosch Hardware Bible (2nd edition).  The HB givesmost (if not all) of the information I will need concerning scan codes and even a wire diagram for the PS/2 style connector I will need, but it leaves a number of important questions unanswered.1.  Is it synchronous or asynchronous serial communication?  I'm    guessing synchronous since the host is providing a clock.  In either    event, how is the data framed?2.  Is it half-duplex or truly one way?  I'm guessing half-duplex    since the host can turn LEDs on and off.3.  Are there any chipsets available for communicating with the "AT    keyboard standard" (other than by cannibalizing a real keyboard)?If anyone knows of a book or article (or any other written source ofinformation) on the above, please advise me at gamet@erg.sri.com.Whatever I do it must be safe for I cannot afford to replace the 486 inthe event of a booboo.Thank you for your time.Danke fuer Ihre Zeit.Thomas Gamet (gamet@erg.sri.com)Software EngineerSRI International

 20To clarify:  VC++ *is* considered an upgrade for C7.  There will be no productcalled C 8.0 (although the command-line compiler of VC++ lists itsversion as 8.00).  C7 is not a "DOS"-only product -- it is a C/C++compiler capable of producing executables for DOS or Windows, as isVC++ (Pro. Ed.).  The (significant) difference is that VC++ comes withmany Windows-hosted tools (ide, etc) which assist developers increating Windows executables much more quickly (basically byautomating the thousands of lines of boilerplate code).  Initialimpressions have been very favorable.Everyone who is a registered user of C7 should have received aconsiderable amount of info regarding the specifics of C7.

When someone posts ahuge attached binary file, I have no choice but to receive it along withall the other new articles in the groups I subscribe to.

 18Hi.  My last question for the year.  I have a mail-order no-name notebookwith 4 meg ram.  I never have problems with my huge ramdisk or whenrunning desqview, but Win3.1 and W4W2.0 constantly crash on me, mostcommonly citing a "memory parity error."  The only thing I can do is TURNOFF and re-boot.  My CMOS ticks off & counts all the memory every startup,and there is never a problem with this either.Could it be a bug in my Windows copy instead of the hardware?  I rememberhaving some disk error problems when installing it.Is there any change I could make to lessen the frequency or likelyhood ofthis happening (I think win vs win /s produce different crashes, but bothcrash frequently nonetheless)I know this is a pain, but PLEASE answer by EMAIL because my home accountdoesn't have rn.  And I will stop asking questions now.  Thank you.Chet Pager = chetter@ucthpx.uct.ac.za
 20Greetings!   I've had a bunch of problems with the 24x.  Opening a DOS window on thedesktop can occasionally result in the windows "blowing up" into a set ofhorizontal lines, hashing the entire desktop.  Nothing can recover this except to completely exit from Windows.  The other irritating problem isthat windows that scroll often overwrite lines rather than actuallyscrolling, as if a CR was printed without an LF.  This seems ONLY to happento communications programs, but I can't nail it down any further than that.Note, though, that the comms programs don't have to be communicating.  Evenjust scrolling back through capture buffers or displaying disk files inthese programs causes the problem.      Prior to the latest rev of Word Perfect for Windows, WPwin would sometimesblow up, and the error message would cite the video driver as the source ofthe problem.  I've still seen this, but only once or twice with WPwin 5.2.      Dave Zimmerman   (My opinions are my own)

I don't think it is thefunction overloading at all-- I do that sort of thing all of the timein BC++ without a hitch.  The big problems I have encountered inporting MFC to BC++ is that fact that MFC _depends_ on a couple ofinvalid C++ assumptions.I have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under BC++, butthe reason is that MS makes some bad assumptions about the order inwhich static/global objects are initialized (i.e. some objects aregetting accessed before they are initialized).  The problem is in theowner-draw menu code somewhere-- if you comment out that section, allother pieces of ctrltest work fine.Two other major gotchas I have found using MFC under BC++:- The CFile::OpenFlags enum uses hard-coded numbers for the open mode,  rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl.h (which differ  between MSC and BC).- All of the MFC collection classes depend on another bad C++  assumption-- that a reference to a base object can used be in place  of a reference to a derived object (true for pointers, NOT for  references).I am sure there are other problems along the same lines, but I havenot encountered them (yet).  I have not seen MFC 2.0 yet, but I hopethat some of these will be addressed.  If they are not, all of MS'shype about portability to other vendor's compilers will be just that.--       If these were my employer's opinions, I wouldn't be posting them.###############################################################################  "Whoever said nothing lasts forever was obviously  # R.

It is the same priceas the stealth card. Plus it is also based on S3 928 chip the newest andfastest chip from s3. Everyone, if you are looking for a card, SEE THE APRIL ISSUE OF PC MAGAZINEFOR THEIR REVIEW.  They noted this person's problem with dos. The stealth card is not a very gooddos performer. The Actix card is rated the best in this chip class (non localbus). It got glowing reports from the magazine (was a best buy) and I calledthem directly and they just updated their windows drivers last week! They havea bulletin board to get the latest drivers. Though somone posted that this bbs was at 2400. AT any rate, the Actix graphics engine ultra outperforms all the other cardsin the 928 class (based on the winmark results).If you are looking for the all around best dos/windows performance  check outthe actix card. Their 1-800 number is 927-5557.P.S. The article in pc magazine noted that if you are a regular dos user (ie:games) then you should also check out the 801 chip from s3. It apparentlyscores just as well and in many cases slightly better in dos than the 928 chip(ie: stealth and actix cards.) They have "comparable" windows performance andare cheaper to buy.Eric

 14On my PC I almost exclusively run windows. The only dos based application  I have is ProcommPlus.  In my config.sys I have emm386 loaded with the  option noems (no expanded memory). Following a thread in one of the comp  newsgroups, I read that it was no necessary to have emm386 loaded. Indeed,  in the manual, it says that emm386 is used to get expanded memory out of  extended memory. Since I have the noems option, it seems to me that the  emm386 device is useless in my case. Should I use emm386 or should I remove it from my config.sys?Thanks for your help,-Eric

Or is it proprietory format ?Your help is greatly appriciated.Thanks,

Getting occasional corruptedfiles, even with smartdrive, 32 bit access turned off.Had these problems under DOS 5.  Only with drive C.Drive D may have had one failure, but that file wasunder the control of Win/Winword on drive C.All utilities available to me report no problems.DOS, NDD (NU4.5).  Another symptom, SD took foreveron C, and kicked me out with a suspension till NDD run6 to 8 times.Thanks.--   Mike Hayes             |"Knowledge is good."  - Faber College Motto  WWW                    |"Knowledge and Thoroughness" -Rensselear Poly Motto  Unemployed Tech,       |"No, thank YOU!"  -Groucho Marx, 'A Day at the Races'  Driven to banging my head against engineering physics for 4 years.
 20I am looking for the latest drivers for the Actix graphics accelerator card. The driver I am currently using is version 1.21 and doesn't support more than 256 colors in 1024x768 mode even you have 2MB memory. The BBS support for Actix is unbelievable! They are still using 2400bps modem! It will take you hours to download the drivers, it hurts when youare calling long distance. Is there any ftp site that has a collectionof video drivers for windows?BTW, anyone using this card, and how do you like it so far?Thanks.-- Daniel Y.H.

Not to be selfish, and to give you a motivefor responding, I promise I am going to collect all the answers, and theactual drivers (provided u give me a site to get it from or uuencode&mail)get the WinMarks using PC Magazine`s WinBENCH and... post the results here...I am interested in SVGA drivers only (plain VGA users should run the Windriver, or this is what I 've heard -- dont flame me!)

The user site can enter theirsite-specific "batch profile" into a dataset within our product, specifyingthe pathname to the SAS executable, specifying site specific SAS options,etc.  At run time certain variables are resolved, and the resolved file iswritten to an external ascii file.  Then I exit to the operating system andrun the job asynchronously, returning to the interactive session as soon asthe job is submitted.  The batch job then runs concurrently with theinteractive session.As currently designed, the internal dataset has a record length of 80characters.  But, to run the batch job, the command to reinvoke SAS inbatch mode requires more than 80 characters.  Up til NT this has not been aproblem, since every job control/shell language up til NT (eg.MVS/CMS/VMS/UNIX/OS2) had a way to escape the CR/LF and enter a singlecommand across multiple lines (OS/2 via their REXX language, which is*STANDARD* with OS/2).The gist of all this is, since this application is for end-users, notwithin my company, I have to try to develop this process using native NT.Since my first posting I've learned that there are several third partycompanies that provide alternative script languages for Windows/Windows NT.And I'm sure a company that licenses our product would use that alternativescript language if they had it, but I can't develop under the assumptionthat they have anything other than what comes with NT.I saw another post on this list (the subject was something like "Is viavailable for Windows?") in which someone said that vi, make, awk, and***ksh*** was available with Microsoft TOOLKIT.  What is that product?  Isit a separate product or part of Windows?  ksh would do what I need if Icould count on it at all NT sites.One last question:  I've heard that NT has remote processing capabilities,i.e. I could shove this batch job off to a server machine and have it runthere.  If these are native NT commands rather than network specificcommands, this would also help me improve this process.  If you can commenton these commands, I would appreciate it.Thanks again for the help,--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Scott Bass                           |  SAS Institute Inc.Integrated Systems, A216, x6975      |  SAS Campus Drive, Cary, NC  27513-2414sasswb@k2.unx.sas.com                |  (919) 677-8001 x6975------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 24I have a 486 sx 25 and I recently added a SCSI drive to my system using an  Adaptec 1522 (non busmastering) controller. Yesterday I ran coretest to  find out drive performance and these are the values I gotSeagate 106 Meg: 875.1kb/Sec14.5ms avg seek   3.7ms track to track Quantum 400 Meg SCSI: 991.2 Kb/sec  12.7 avg seek 3.6 track to track.First off all are these good results? I don't know what typical values  are.What I'm wondering now is the following. My swap file is currently on the  IDE. I could move it to the SCSI which is 13% faster, but then I would not  be able to use 32-bit access which might actuall make it slower. So on  which drive should I put my swap file to get best results? Is there a swap  file speed test program out there?Finally, I also ran the above tests with the ASPI2DOS driver loaded and I  got no difference whatsoever in performance. Is there any reason at all  why I should load this driver?Thanks in advance, I will post a summary if I get enough responses.-Eric

 32I'm writing a mail management system using Word for Windows 2.0 asa front end. The user dials up a remote system and downloads a batchof mail as "foo.txt ." I've set up an AutoExec macro in Winword to load"foo.txt" OK, but subsequent invocations of the macro will of coursepose file name contention problems.What I'd really like to do is to create an AutoExit macro in Winwordthat would move "foo.txt" to a specified directory, rename it usingthe current date and time, and delete the original "foo.txt ."In other words, "foo.txt" gets renamed as "5012300", say, on May 1at 23:00- the user gets a time-indexed backup of his mail files and"foo.txt" is freed up for the next packet of mail, since my AutoExecmacro points to it.My main question is this: How may one rename a file from within a WordBasic macro to include a time/date variable in the new filename?

What I'd really like though is a way to create .RLE files myself,specifically the RLE4 format mentioned in the winlogo readme file.

 23Since swapping out my generic VGA card for a Diamod Speedstar 24X, I have noticed two new problems:* if I create a windowed MS-DOS session (386 mode), when the text starts    to scroll, rather than printing characters it starts to print   horizontal lines that spill out to the desktop and trash the entire    display.  Ctrl-alt-del terminates the dos window and restores the    desktop* after a short time in NCD's PC X-remote for windows, all characters    displayed on the desktop are changed to be unreadable; I am unable to  restore without rebooting.These are in both 256 and 16 color 800x600 drivers, large and small fonts.DOS 5, Win 3.1, emm386 and smartdrv installed.I like the speed of the card and have had no other problems.

 49Message-ID: <1rg3m9INN5tc@swan.doc.ic.ac.uk>NNTP-Posting-Host: swan.doc.ic.ac.ukA couple of weeks ago I posted a question concerningcommunicatingbetween VB and MSACCESS using DDE. The answers I received atthat timeallowed me to get a prototype of my project working. However,duringthis process I have come up with new problems.1) There seems to be a limit of 255 characters for a DDE Topicstring. Isthis inherent in all DDE systems or just peculiar to MSACCESSor VB?2) It is easy to query an Access database from VB using theDDE SQL command,(provided the above limitation is overcome by using shortfield and tablenames) but how is one meant to update a database?   a) A DDE SQL UPDATE command does not seem to work.   b) Initiating an Access macro using a DDE Execute commandfrom VB cannot      be used because when the macro requests information fromVB using a      second DDE channel the programs dead lock until time-outs occur.      (The VB to Access channel has to close before the Accessto VB channel      is initiated, I guess.)   c) Access does not allow VB to DDE POKE the information.   The way I eventually managed to update a database was bysending key-   strokes from VB to Access using the SendKeys command. Thistechnique has   the problem that Access cannot be minimised and it mustalways be in a   state ready to respond to the sequence of key-strokes VBsends.Are all the above statements correct or have I made incorrectassumptions?Are there any better work arounds to the above? Are there anysigns of anODBC driver for Access?Bobran@doc.ic.ac.uk

 9I have several people sharing my machine and would like to set up separateenvironments under Windows for each of them.  Is there some way of settingthings up separate desktops/directories for each of them?  Ideally,I'd like totally separate virtual machines.  I'd be willing to settle forless, and may end up having batch files that copy .ini files arounddepending on who wants to use the machine.markAlas, Setup/n doesn't work if you don't have a network.
 384Well, I'm amazed at how successful this exercise was. I received 20responses and 4 requests for summary. Thanks to everyone who made itpossible.On my own I was able to find out about Codebase, Accsys, and Q+E. Codebaseand Accsys are C libraries without SQL. Q+E is a Windows applicationthat can be communicated through Windows DDE calls, where you send a SQLstring and receive the results.Most people wrote to tell me about the Paradox Engine from Borland. Other products mentioned were: Microsoft's ODBC, Accsys, Quadbase, Codebase,RBASE, and Q+E. Only ODBC, Quadbase, RBASE, and Q+E have SQL.For myself, I decided on Codebase, mostly because it has an ANSI Cportability version that runs under DOS, UNIX, etc, and includes thesource code, and portability is important in my application. It workswith DBASE, FoxPro, or Clipper files.However, I feel that Microsoft's ODBC looks very promising.It's mostly a formalisation of building and submitting SQL queries, andformatting query results. As the responses say, it's available via ftp,except it's effectively unusuable without two manuals:the "ODBC Programmer's Reference" and the "ODBC SDK Guide". Moreover,ODBC doesn't actually interpret SQL and liase with databases, that's up to drivers that should be provided by database manufacturers. Also,it's Windows only (it's actually an extension to the Windows SDK). Nevertheless, it's a start at a SQL interface standard, and shouldmake life interesting in the future.Here's my original post, followed by the responses, separated by a line of asterisks (*).> Does anyone know if Borland or Microsoft have libraries for accessing> their respective databases (Paradox, FoxPro) from within C programs?> I'd really like to be able to build a SQL query string and pass it> to a function which returns the query results in some format.

There are indeed C libs for Fox access, but I can't think of thenames offhand - I'm sure someone has already written you in that regard -(I think I just saw an add for a Fox lib in the "C Users Journal", whichis a good place to look for this type of package in general, by the way).I've been paying my dues to learn a lot of the quirks of PX Eng. over thepast year - wouldn't recommend it for a complex multiuser app.--but I'mstaying with it for now--it's like a bad marriage: I've got too much timeinvested in learning and work-arounds!

 38I have been experiencing several end-user problems with various commercialsoftware packages (WordPerfect 5.2/WIN, Publish It!/WIN 3.1) and printinglandscape mode on a Citizen PN48 (the little guy) or the Citizen GSX-140+.In a nutshell the problem is that I lose the first 0.625 inches ofinformation from my left margin, be it white space or TrueType fontoutput, and margins are not preserved on subsequent pages past thefirst.WordPerfect had a workaround consisting of using the "Default" locationfor the printers instead of "Tractor" or "Manual".  They have also filedthis as a bug and are continuing to investigate it.MS Write, of course, has no problem with these printer drivers, proving thatMicrosoft knows something the rest of us don't!  Are you surprised?  I'mnot.Publish It!/WIN is still investigating this problem, and while I was consider-my options (rejecting the one about buying an $800 DTP package, for *surely*they wouldn't have this problem, right?) I stumbled onto a global workaround.WORKAROUND----------Go into the Windows 3.1 control panel, select printers, select your Citizenprinter driver, select SETUP, and select a custom size of 850 x 1132.  Likemagic, all of your problems will go away.Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies!-- Mike------------------------------------------------------------------------Disclaimer: My opinions do not necessarily reflect those of my employer.========================================================================------------------------------------------------------------------------     mike.rovak@drd.com     ========================================================================

It is incorporated as a part of win.com.To make a new win.com, you have to concatinate three files together, using the /b option for a binary concatonation.  I beleive it iscopy /b win.cnf+vgalogo.lgo+vgalogo.rle mywin.comMake sure you backup your win.com file in anotehr directory before you do this -- I absent-mindedly typed win.com instead of mywin.com and had to resinstall Windows!Anyway, substitute whatever .RLE file you want.  The win.cnf has the info needed to start Windows (think of it as a bootstrap) and vgalogo.vga has video information.  Just make sure that the .RLE file doesn't tip the whole COM file size over the 64k limit of a .COM file!So anyway, I use mywin.com to startup MS Windows.  Now instead of that annoying Micro$oft advertisment, I have the Joker (yes, from Batman) taking yoru picture from the screen, saying "Smile!"  Also a little bit of text: "Micro$oft Windows: The world's first commercially sucessful virus."

 13Hello - I am in need of a file viewer for 24 bit TIFF images, to run under        windows (3.1 if it matters); alternatively a package to run an        X-server on top of windows would do very well. Unfortunately the        budget for this is limited so whatever I end up using has to be        public domain or very inexpensive. Thanks in advance for any help,        johnchapman@cs.sfu.ca
 24My Windows 3.1 installation has somehow gone awry.  Whenever I try to runWindows now, the logo comes up OK, but when it tries to enter Windowsitself, the screen gets totally screwed up as if it's in the wronggraphics mode or something.  It's completely illegible although functionalas I can still exit to DOS with an ALT-E RETURN combination.I tried to reinstall Windows again, but if you recall, halfway through theinstallation process, install takes you into Windows and there my graphicsproblem surfaces again so I cannot complete the re-installation.All this started after trying to get a game working on my system but myconfig.sys and autoexec.bat have been restored to what they were beforethis problem cropped up.I'm running a 486-33DX with a Diamond Stealth VRAM (I've resinstalled theStealth video drivers again but with no luck).  I'm also using QEMM andStacker 3.0 but Windows is installed on an un-stacked partition.  And ofcourse, it worked perfectly before.Any email replies and suggestions would be appreciated.  Thanks.-Hutch-

If you use a non-vga screen (e.g. Cga, ega, svga, there is also away to do it, but I thing instead of vgalogo.lgo you use another file,such as cgalogo.lgo, egalogo.lgo, or something.  I'm not sure aboutthis, as I have a vga, but i'm sure you could find it in the faq (awindows help ver. of which *is* available at cica, but don't konw thefilename). ALSO....your .bmp has to be 16 COLOURS Or less.These specs rule out some of the good .bmp's.  I found cartoon drawingswork quite well as they have the advantage of looking good with littlememory.Finally, REMEMBER TO SAVE YOUR CURRENT WIN.COM before, and put yournew win.com in the windows directory.  Also, don't start windows from adirectory where another win.com is present, as *that* is used instead ofthe one in the windows dir, and win. won't start.Share this fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie (PF).Mickey-- pe-|| ||  MICHAEL PANAYIOTAKIS: louray@seas.gwu.edu ace|| ||                                   ...!uunet!seas.gwu.edu!louray|||| \\/|  *how do make a ms-windows .grp file reflect a HD directory??*\\\\\\\\   |  "well I ain't always right, but I've never been wrong.."(gd)

I read and replyto the mail with a MS Windows 3.1 based editor.Everything works peachey keen as long as the author of the message hasmaintained his text at 80 col. max. width. Sometimes I get slightly widermessages that run off-screen, so I have to use the cursor/slider to readthe whole thing.I'm using NDW Deskedit mainly, but I've experienced the same prob withall other MS WIndows editors.

 45HowdyWe have been having a real problem with an AST 386sx/16 machine with4mb of RAM.  We installed Paradox for Windows, (but I don't think Paradox is the real problem here), and the installation went ok(windows is installed on a local drive, paradox installed on a novellnetwork (netware 386 v3.26 or greater), DOS 5, Win 3.1) but the programwill not load in 386 enchanted mode.  The thermometer bar goes to 60%and we then either get a 'invalid command.com' or a windows nastygramtalking about an illegal instruction.  I've checked out the command.comthing, but as a long-time C programmer, I've crashed my share of machineswith pointer problems and this is a standard behavior :-)Anyway, paradox will run in standard mode, but not enhanced.  We also havequattro pro windows, exhibiting the same behavior.  Spent about 2 hourswith Borland's tech people, with no avail.  The guy I talked to a microsoftdidn't want to really dig in and help, as he gave up pretty quickly.Somewhat disappointing, really.  I expected more from Microsoft.  You'd thinkwith all the millions of windows installations that they would have seen allthe possible problems, but I guess not...Microsoft had sent us a 13 page fax on fixing UAE and GeneralProtection faults (sorry, I can't fax anything out of here so pleasedon't ask, try Microsoft), which we tried.  We did *everything* theysaid, and still no luck.So.  If you can help, please mail me.

I had gotten an advertisement for it and put it aside with my list of 'I Wants.' After installing the software, it didn't load. No part of the software would load even though the install went seemingly well.I called Deltapoint with the problem and after asking me twenty million different questions about my system.. concluded that I had one of the systems that the software was 'incompatible with'. Of course they're willing to give me my $$$ back.. What a waste of time and energy.  The folks on their support line, although nice, are extremely ignorant regarding the workings of Windows 3.1. After my experience with the installation of the SB 16, I  learned some of the function of windows dll files. Before sending back Desktop Animator,  decided to do some fooling around with the different versions of .dll files I had. I had 2 versions of cpalette.dll one dated 8/92 and > 100K the other dated 1/93 and smaller (the 1/93 smaller version was the one supplied with Desktop Animator). I moved the bigger, older version of cpalette.dll  to a directory outside my path. (For some reason, I had the older Cpalette.dll in my Windows directory and the newer cpallette in my windows\\system directory.) When I did this, the animator's editor loaded.. and so did 2 other of the applications in the package.. the main application still didn't load. Does anyone have any ideas as to why this would occur or any further suggestions for trouble-shooting?               ____                  /    \\__                    Darla  |\\         /    @   \\  \\ \\_______|    \\  .:|>     Portal: darla@shell.portal.com   \\      ##|    | \\__/              darla@cup.portal.com             |    ####\\__/   \\           AOL: kuby2u@aol.com    /  /  ##       \\|                darlaiam@aol.com   /  /__________\\  \\           WIX: darla   |GENIE: KUBY       L_JJ           \\__JJ

 15Ok, here's a nice easy question for all you out there.When running DOS 5.0 under Windows 3.0, I lose the ability to do aprint-screen.I have no problem with this when I'm running DOS not under Windows.If it's relavant, I'm using 'Quarterdeck 6.0' expanded memory manager formy 386.  Please e-mail any responses, since I don't get to read the news too often.

 150Hi.While running the MS Quick C compiler in a DOS window under Windows 3.1 this evening, I got a "program has violated system integrity... close all applications, exit windows and restart your computer" error.I started to do this when I immediately got a "Serious disk error" messagefrom Windows.  "hit return to retry".  I did that about 5 times and thenrebooted to find that quite a few files have been corrupted somehow.(I am including the chkdsk output below.)Questions:1)  Is there an easy way to restore everything to working order?What might be some better approaches?2)  What might have caused this?  Does the SMARTDRV cache make me morevulnerable?  (I'm suspicious of hard drive caches especially when theycache data writing.)The straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the /f option to fix the disk and then it looks like I would probably have to reinstall Windowsand a few other things.Thanks for your comments and suggestions.Brad Bankops:  this is a 386sx machine with a 40Mb hard drive and 2 Mb of RAM.chkdsk output:======================================================================Volume Serial Number is 1159-09D3Errors found, F parameter not specifiedCorrections will not be written to diskC:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\CVPIC.EXE   Allocation error, size adjustedC:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\VPIC.TXT   Allocation error, size adjustedC:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\VIDEO7.CFG   Allocation error, size adjustedC:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\ORCPRO2.CFG   Allocation error, size adjustedC:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\VGA.CFG   Allocation error, size adjustedC:\\GAME\\GOOSE\\BIRD2.X   Allocation error, size adjustedC:\\WINMISC\\ADV21\\WINADV.EXE   Allocation error, size adjusted   316 lost allocation units found in 224 chains.    647168 bytes disk space would be freedC:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\CVPIC.EXE   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16133C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\GENO5400.CFG   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16138C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\TRI8800B.CFG   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16139C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\TS4000HI.CFG   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16140C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\CONFIG.DOC   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16141C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\VPIC.TXT   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16146C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\VIDEO7.CFG   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16151C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\DEFINCON.CFG   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16152C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\ATIWONDR.CFG   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16153C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\GENO6400.CFG   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16154C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\OAK.CFG   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16155C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\HIRES.CFG   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16156C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\AHEADA.CFG   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16157C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\VPIC.DOC   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16208C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\ORCPRO2.CFG   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16184C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\EVERX673.CFG   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16185C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\WAIT.COM   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16186C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\MAXXON.CFG   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16187C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\WAIT.DOC   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16188C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\EVERX678.CFG   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16189C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\EGA.CFG   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16190C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\CONFIG.EXE   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16191C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\README.1ST   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16199C:\\GFX\\VPIC46\\VGA.CFG   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16201C:\\GAME\\GOOSE\\BIRD2.X   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16382C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM\\SOUND.DRV   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16380C:\\WINDOWS\\GAMES0.GRP   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16367C:\\WINDOWS\\MAD79-11.BMP   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16341C:\\MAGE\\DEMO2_2A.KIN   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16151C:\\MAGE\\DEMO2_2B.KIN   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16257C:\\MAGE\\PKIN_2_2.EXE   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16339C:\\WINMISC\\GAMES\\DIALWORD.EXE   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16184C:\\WINMISC\\GAMES\\DIALWORD.TXT   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16201C:\\WINMISC\\ADV21\\WINADV.WRI   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16257C:\\WINMISC\\ADV21\\ADV.KEY   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16265C:\\WINMISC\\ADV21\\ADV.REC   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16275C:\\WINMISC\\ADV21\\FREEZER   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16339C:\\386SPART.PAR   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16133C:\\BNG2.MBX   Is cross linked on allocation unit 16146  42366976 bytes total disk space   3958784 bytes in 4 hidden files    153600 bytes in 67 directories  36042752 bytes in 1496 user files   1564672 bytes available on disk      2048 bytes in each allocation unit     20687 total allocation units on disk       764 available allocation units on disk    655360 total bytes memory    579712 bytes free-- Brad Banko;  Dept of Physics;  U of Illinois;  b-banko@uiuc.edu=========================================================================See one.

 401Hello again,About a week and one-half ago I posted a query looking for people feelingson the inkjet family of printers.  Specifically, a comparison between theCanon BJ200 (BubbleJet) and the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500.  Many peopleasked me to post the summary/account of all the postings and e-mail Ireceived.  Below is my original query and the responses I received.  I havenot deleted any part of the responses, only the headers and signatures, soyou can extract what you find necessary.  Some people asked me for anunbiased account; however, the very nature of the question suggestsfavoritism and biased comments, you must extract the information youbelieve unbiased and a fair representation of each printer.  There are awide range of comments, each has its own value.  There was no clear winner, some like the BJ200 (especially itsprice/performance ratio), others preferred the durability and reliabilityof the DeskJet (the original inkjet with proven drivers and a solidbackground).  Two new inkjet printers have drawn some attention, a newprinter to be introduced by Hewlett-Packard later this year (aroundsummertime), and an addition to the Epson product line (their firstinkjet).  You will find that after the initial purchase, the costs ofre-filling or replacing the ink cartridges are about the same (this largelydepends on where you purchase the re-fills or replacements -- so shoparound first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of yourprinter).  No one mentioned approx. how many sheets each ink cartridge willprint, but I suspect they are roughly equal at about 1000 - 1500 sheets(laser printers will do 4000-5000 sheets per toner cartridge).  Well,that's a brief research summary of my personal research.  ENJOY!===========================================================================>Hello fellow 'netters.>>I am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer I>should purchase, the Canon BJ200 (BubbleJet) vs. the HP DeskJet 500.

Basically, your>personal experiences with either of these machines is highly desirable,>both good and bad.>Well I bought the BJ 200 about a month ago at the start of their $50 rebateprogram on that printer (it ends 5/31), and I bought it from ComputerDiscount Warehouse because their price of $325 couldn't be beat anywhere Ilooked, and I think it's a HOT printer.  Just using regular copier paperproduced fantastic results just in high quality mode.  I compared theoutput of a Micrografx Designer legal size drawing with 4pt type done on myBJ 200 with the same drawing printed on an HP Laserjet IID and I was amazedhow well I could read the small print on the BJ 200.  Printing speed wasseveral seconds faster on the BJ 200 which is amazing considering that theHP has 2.5M ram installed.  I measured the time from when the printer firstindicated it was receiving data (as I used print manager in Windows).I showed the output to several people at work and one manager bought oneimmediately for his office, and two other engineers placed their orderstoo.  If you need CDW's phone number, it's 800-598-4239.  Delivery to NYwas two days.Good luck!Craig Witkowski, CENG51@maccvm.corp.mot.comMotorola Communications & Electronics Inc.Glen Rock,  NJ===========================================================================I own a Deskjet 500. Performance isn't spectacular under Windows usingTrueType fonts but neither is the Canon from what I have seen. Quality forthe HP is very much dependent on paper quality - on 'standard' photo-copypaper the characters have slightly 'frayed' edges but on better quality'distinction' type paper things look better. For most applications I findcopy paper fine - still better than dot-matrix.  Comes with a Windowsdriver, which seems to by-pass print manager, has a few'intelli-fonts'which are HP scaleable fonts - probably faster than TrueTypebut haven't really tried them out. Can get RAM & FONT cartridges but unlessthe speed of TrueType is a problem I wouldn't bother. The RAM cartridgescan't be used as buffer - soft fonts only.For graphics, i.e. BMP images etc the HP can be put into a dither mode viathe HP supplied Win driver. There a number of dither options such as'scatter', 'pattern' etc.  The manual gives recommendations depending onthe type of image being printed.  Text is not so good in this mode. Problemarises when you have a document which contains both graphic and text.  Therange of tones for graphic images isn't brilliant but I think that is moreof a limitation with inkjet printers in general.>From what I have seen the Canon is similar in most respects.However, a printer definitely worth looking at is the new inkjet fromEpson.  This printer is faster, cheaper, and capable of producinglaser-like quality on normal copier paper.  Can't remember the model #, LX- something I think?I purchased my HP days before the Epson was released here :-{.  Theintroductory price on the Epson was the same as the HP here in New Zealand. ===========================================================================About a month ago, I got a Canon BJ200.  I absolutely LOVE it.  It isincredibly fast, except for printing from PSPICE (I don't know if you everdo stuff with that or not.)  Most of the stuff I print is either fromMicrosoft Word for Windows or just plain text.  The only problems I've hadare printing headers/footers (the printer freaked out), and printing oncheap paper (lots of streaks).  Normal copy paper works great with it, youcan only tell it's not laser-printed by holding it, oh, less than twelveinches from your face.  (That is, if you're nearsighted, like me! :) ) Theprinter comes with its own driver for Windows 3.1!!  I have no othercomplaints.  The printer also can act just like some EPSON or another forthose archaic software packages that haven't written a driver for it yet.The teeny-weeny footprint is a real plus, too--AND, if you purchase itbetween now and May 31, you get a $50 rebate from Canon!!  I bought minefrom a store called CompUSA, and the price now is $340.  I have a friendwho has the HP you are looking at.  It also prints very well, and everyonehas drivers for it, BUT it is VERY slow!Hope I helped!(360dpi sure looks great!)Heather Stehman===========================================================================In article <1993Apr19.122649.25263@schbbs.mot.com>, CENG51@maccvm.corp.mot.com (Craig Witkowski) writes:> In message <1993Apr18.041741.6051@CSD-NewsHost.Stanford.EDU>> kayman@csd-d-3.Stanford.EDU (Robert Kayman) writes:> Hello fellow 'netters.> >>I am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer I>>should purchase, the Canon BJ200 (BubbleJet) vs. the HP DeskJet 500.

I prefer the Deskjet.  The printing speed and qualityare similar (I tested both with text and graphics before buying the Deskjetfor home).  The feature that sets the Deskjet apart is the driver supportin so many applications.  The BJ ends up emulating the Epson LQ or IBMProprinter to get it to work with many non-windows apps and this will bethe case for a long time.  The design is superior if you just want to usecut paper, the Deskjet is quieter, AND the ink cartridges are quite a bitcheaper due to the number of Deskjets out there in comparision to the BJs.  Just my $0.02 worth..-- Mike MattixAgricultural Group of MonsantoP.O. Box 174Luling, LA 70070INTERNET Address: dmmatt@bigez.monsanto.com===========================================================================  Yes, there is the landscape mode printing problem, but it does notpresent a problem in Windows as the Windows printer driver handles thetranslation.  I actually thought of some other points after I posted thenote.  The Deskjet has an unprintable area of approximately .5inch aroundthe paper the Bubblejet does not.  You are right about the graphicsresolutions, I tested the printers with the applications I had access to:Wordperfect, Harvard Graphics, WinGIF, Paintshop PRO, and Paintbrush andcould not tell a difference.  In fact one of the HP Deskjet Windows driversgives you significant control over the contrast and density of the printerhence controlling the amount of ink you put down.  The Bubblejet did not.I had no imaging software to test the printers with and so had nocomparision there.  Finally, I wanted sheet feeding.  In that configurationthe Bubblejet cost approximately $100 more than the Deskjet.I went through a pretty thorough evaluation and chose the Deskjet when Ispent my own money.  BTW, I am replacing the BJ-300 with a Deskjet 500 atwork this month anyway.RegardsMike MattixAg Group of MonsantoLuling, LA===========================================================================I spent some time comparing the two.  We ended up getting the BubblejetBJ-200 versus the HP.  Our reasons were:1) The HP seemed to have worse banding than the Canon2) 360dpi versus 300 - we felt we could see the difference3) Price - Canon has a $50 rebate program going on at the moment.The BJ-200 was our choice over the BJ-10ex - we could have 100 pages in theBJ-200 feeder.  The BJ-10ex holds only 30 pages, I think.As you can see, up to 100 pages on the BJ-200.  We haven't done anythingbig with the BJ, but its performance seems reasonable under Windows.  Iknow that the Microsoft BBS has a newer windows driver than comes with theprinter, but I don't know how it compares (also the driver included withthe printer is Canon's whereas I don't know where the Microsoft BBS onecomes from - Microsoft?)Hope this helps.-- Thomas V. Frauenhofer, WA2YYWtvf@cci.com, ...!uunet!uupsi!cci632!tvf, tvf@cs.rit.eduMandlebratwurst: The Meal that Eats Itself!===========================================================================Altough I'm sometimes also a salesperson (if I'm not suppost to study :-))I would recommend to buy the BJ200. The printing quality is a bit better,but you you've got much more possiblities. Don't forget the HP engine is atleast 2 years on the marked, the Canon engine (witch is also used inother "new" bubblejet printers like e.g. the Epson ones) is quite recentlyavailable..> Now, I would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 360> dpi of the Canon BubbleJet vs. the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500 (300 dpi).> Which is faster?

The Canon was a bit better..Greetz,Kris===========================================================================When we decided we needed quiet printers in our hospital we looked toinkjet printers.  They have near laser quality, speed, and they are quiet.We use both HP Deskjets and the Canon BJ-200s.  I prefer the paper handlingqualities of the Deskjets but I feel the Canons have superior printquality.  The Ideal would be a Canon with a sheet feeder, however I did endup buying a deskjet for home use (got too good a deal).  Anyway, we areusing Canons in high volume areas and they are holding up very well.  Outof 15 Deskjets and 4 BJ-200s I have only had one problem with a deskjet andthat was taken care of very quickly by HP.-Nate===========================================================================Whenever I buy anything I look at what the "experts" say, pick out the topfew and then buy on whatever criteria are the most apt.  I've beenunusually flush lately (no begging letter please) and so I've done this afew times including - about four months ago - with inkjet printers.I can't remember much about the process except that I read about threereviews of inkjets and that the 500 was always at or near the top.  Ibought the 500C because of the added dimension of colour (I intend to builda multi- media machine at some stage and have just bought a colour scannertowards that).  Although I haven's used the colour thing in earnest yet Itried it out on a couple of Windows bitmaps and I was pleased with theresult.I note that even though you can now get the 550C (the one with both colourand mono with no need to change the cartridge), the 500C and 500 are stillreadily available (at least in the UK).  The following are myviews/experience:1.I don't know anything about the Canon except that I came awayfrom reviews (and replies to a posting similar to yours) withthe idea that the HP offered the best performance/price ratio.2.I believe HP are the originals in the field - not always theideal place to be but the market's still young so one assumesthey have the expertise.3.The 500C is worth the extra.  Operation in mono is perfectlyacceptable and I get good crisp reproduction of fonts fromWindows.4.I used to work for Monotype when they still manufacturedtypesetters (before their AMERICAN owners closed them down!)and I can tell you that in terms of definition 300 dpi ispretty poor anyway so 360 dpi is just a bit less poor...5.The HP comes with a reasonable set of drivers.6.If you buy it invest in the additional RAM pack - it's prettyslow with it, God knows what it's like without!I actually work in Germany and my PC is home in the UK so it's not in dailyuse.  I would say that apart from my not reading the manual properly andhaving a really dumb problem at the start it's easy peasy to operate.Hope this is of use.RegardsDavid===========================================================================Just bought the BJ-200.  I thought the price couldn't be beat ($329, with$50 rebate thru 5/31) and so far it is comparable, even superior, to theDeskJet in print quality.Speed:   Per page rate seems to be faster (I don't have figures).         I don't print long docs, though.Quality: I think the graphics quality is excellent.  Print quality is         excellent as well, unless you use small fonts and hold it up         close; you can see a lot more "jaggies" than on a LaserJet.         The 360 dpi is offset by a little less accuracy in holding the         page/print head in place, I would imagine.Large docs:  Not room in the standard model for a whole lotta pages ...         manual says up to 100, though.  Haven't tried it.Drivers:  No problems under Win3.1 yet.  WinWord doesn't want to print         the envelopes the same way the Canon does, though.Know nothing of add-on costs. Daniel A.

I'm a little behind in news readingso I know this may be late.  I just purchased the Canon Bubblejet last night.  I was really worriedthat I wouldn't like it but the print quality, and noise level isfantastic!  I printed quite a few documents with lots of graphics and itprinted DAMN near laser quality.  You can't tell it's not laser unless youget 2 inches from the page.  no problems with drivers.  The printer came with the driver diskettewhich is good because I was beginning to panic when I couldn't findi itunder Windows or WordPerfect.  It works well under both.  I have yet toinstall Word for Windows so don't know how it works with them.  I had a DeskJet 500 at work last year.  It was a good printer as well utI felt it was awfully slow.  And much noisier than the BubbleJet.  I won'tsay the BubbleJet is MUCH better, but I really do like it more.

 21X-Newsreader: Tin 1.1 PL3[ Article crossposted from comp.os.ms-windows.apps ][ Author was Dr. Richard Timmer ][ Posted on 24 Apr 93 23:11:16 GMT ]Hello WinNetters:I have seen a great deal of discussion herein on the relative merits of MS Access and Borland Paradox/Win.  However, are there any users out there with experience with the database package called "Approach".  It has gottena number of very good reviews from the various mags. and it seems like itwould require less hardware overhead than Paradox.  I have ruled out Accessbecause some aspects of it are extremely non-intuitive, e.g. requiring afield to always have a value.  I like what I've seen of Paradox, but itseems like the resource requirements are greater than what I have (386/25 MHz,6 MB ram).So, please provide me with your thoughts are "Approach", good and bad.  Thanks.Richard Timmer
 25I have an EISA machine and I just do not understand why mostEISA video cards only match the performance of their ISAcounterparts. For instance, the EISA Orchid Pro Designer IIs-E isonly about as "fast" as the ISA Diamond SpeedStar Plus, which isn'twhat I would call "fast."I don't understand why EISA video cards aren't, as a group, on thesame level of performance as Local Bus cards, given that EISA videocards have a 32 bit bus to move data around, instead of ISA's 8 bits.Since they are not, why would anyone (me included) pay a highercost for a EISA video card when its performance is no better thanand often worse that a much cheaper ISA video board, such as aDiamond SpeedStar 24X? From PC Magazine's (I think) recent report,I know that ATI makes a pretty fast EISA video card, but it'saround $500, which is just about double what my wallet will allowme to spend. And, for $500, I could get a Diamond Viper and stillhave $100 left over (of course, I'd have to get a Local Bus mother-board too...)Can anyone shed some light on my confusion/frustration?Thanks!

Not only are you moving data on a path twice as wide (atleast), but there is a difference in the number of clocks required forbus transactions between the two busses.  Most ISA boards requiremultiple clocks per bus transaction -- typically this is around 3-4.EISA boards are suppose to be able to 'burst' at a 1:1 rate, so Iwould expect performance to be 6x-8x that of an ISA card.  So I guess, for me, the question is unanswered still.  I would expecthim to be able to see a 6x speed difference, and he apparently doesnot.  -- "Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live in the real world."   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden------------------------------------------------------------------------------Fred.McCall@dseg.ti.com - I don't speak for others and they don't speak for me.

Not saying I know any more than the average salesguy, I'll give your question a shot. The key issue that I bought my BJ-200 on was ink drying speed.  You really have to try awful hard to get the BJ-200 ink to smear.  The HP DeskJets need 10-15 seconds to completely dry.  In both cases, however, do not get your pages wet.  Unlike laser printers, the material on your pages is INK, not toner.  But that should go without saying.My PC has very little memory (only 2Meg RAM), so the BJ-200 takes a little while to print ----- but every application I use takes a while to run.  Once the computer is solely printing, it purs like a kitten and puts pages out every 15-30 seconds, depending on how detailed your graphics are.  The BJ-200 can do Windows soft fonts.  I'm assuming that the DeskJet can, or HP wouldn't sell many......Size is another factor.  The BJ-200 is much smaller, but the HP is built like a tank.  I bet the BJ-200 would get damaged first.Finally, the print quality.  I LOVE the BJ-200's resolution.  It looks like a good laser quality print.  The HP's I've used.....they look like ink.  Not as impressive.  So, I chose the Canon.  Any other opinions?

First of all to try to use plain vanilla Windows is as courageous as to tryto use plain vanilla DOS. There are _lots_ of very nice commercial andshareware packages/utilities that will boost up Windows past what MS itselfthought possible :)... For example, Norton Desktop for Windows 2.0 (a replace-ment for ProgMan) will give you group-within-a-group capability and willeven change group icons, it will launch progs by association (well, FileMandoes that too) or by dragging the file in the apps icon (now Mac doesnt dothat, huh? :) )... And the list goes on and on... Now, Windows _is_ kindahard to finetune, boost and configure, but thats trhe price to pay for notpaying $$$ to get a Mac or an OS/2 capable machine (an entirely differetstory ...)... On the other hand if you dont like the idea of PM's iconsnot correspnding to the files themselves, well they are not supposed to :)..PM is a Program _Launching_ utility not a file manager... Modify your settings to have FM as your shell and not PM, or get a couple of utilitiesfrom cica that supposedly give you a 'Mac feel'... I dont wanna get in thediscussion which is a better system: Mac's are good in their own way -- theyare _different_ not better or worse than Win PCs-- (actually I am writingthis from a Mac lab as a user assistant - so dont think I am partial to Win:) )By all means check out the stuff in cica (ftp to ftp.cica.indiana.edu underthe pub/pc/win3 subdir user: anonymous), or wait for StarTrek (Mac's OS ona PC !!! -- the threads we are gonna have then !!! :) )...Just trying to avoid another Mac-Win war...-- Costas Malamas ____________________________________________________________Georgia Institute of Technology OIT UA -- Opinions expressed are not necessarily OIT's...

But it still moves it at about the speed as the ISA bus.        I think that's either 8 or 10 mhz.        The local bus designs also move 32 bits like the EISA, but        they move the data at the cpu speed, up to 40 mhz.        So, on a 33mhz cpu, the local bus is moving 32bit data at        33 mhz, and the EISA is moving 32bit data at 8 or 10 mhz.        So the local bus should be 3 to 4 times faster than EISA on        a 33 mhz cpu.

But we're also not going to promote pandering tocorporate paranoia when the real issue is convenience.  I don't *like*dealing with floppies.  Personally, I have no use for changing theregistration info, but I see it as a valid need, and one that ought tobe solved using a quick little utility rather than a half-hourreinstall that's just about guaranteed to mess up your settings in oneway or another.So, while I'm not going to put much time into it myself, here's theprocedure for getting on your way to finding the encoded information:1.  Copy all your Windows disks into the directory from which you wantto install it.  I've been using c:\\WINSTALL myself.2.  From there, copy that directory to something like c:\\WINORIG.3.  Install from c:\\winstall.4.  comp the two directories to determine changes.      i.e., comp *.* \\winorig\\*.* >\\report.txt5.  Look in the report file for the file(s) that change.  Assumingthey didn't cover themselves covering their own tracks, at least onefile should have a difference noted at a particular offset.  Locatesaid offset in the original directory and see what's there using a hexeditor, and do the same for the modified one.6.  You're on your own as far as breaking the code goes; I don'treally do cryptography.  It's probably just an xor key or something; Ithink MS is more concerned with Joe Schmoe at the office personalizinghis copy than with "real pirates" who will probably just disassemblethe damned thing anyway.  This technique should work with just aboutany obnoxious corporate product that tries to write to the originalfloppies when you install; in some extreme cases you may not be ableto back the floppies up to hard disk, and will be stuck doing acompare on floppies (Lotus stuff is probably like that).As I noted before, if you can afford the space on the hard disk, anddon't do much in the way of customization, reinstalling from onedirectory to another may be less arduous.  Doing some of the stuffI've mentioned here may well void your license with Microsoft, as ifthey'd ever find out.

 63Hello,    I'm investigating the purchase of an Object Oriented Application Framework.  I havecome across a few that look good:  Zapp 1.1 from Inmark  Zinc 3.5 from Zinc software  C++/Views from Liant  Win++ from BlaiseSome considerations I'm using:  Being new to Windows programming (I'm from the UNIX/X world), the quality andintuitivness of the abstraction that these class libraries provide is very important.  However, since I'm not adverse to learning the internals of Windowsprogramming, the new programming methodology should be closely aligned withthe native one.  I don't believe arbitrary levels of abstraction, just for thesake of changing the API, are valuable.  Since we will be developing for the 32bit Windows NT system thememory management issues and issues particular to the Windows 3.1 API are lessimportant.   We will probably buy another C++ class library (something like Tools.h++ or Boochcomponents from Rational) to handle data structures and other miscellaneous stuff (allocators etc...).  So those features are not that important for this toolkit to have.The two that I have narrowed it down to are ZApp and Zinc, they seem to be the twotoolkits that have received the most attention from the media.  I was wondering ifanyone had any first-hand experience with any of these toolkits (especially ZApp and Zinc).A couple of observations about these toolkits that seem particularly noteworthy are:ZApp----  Seems to have the most extensive coverage of Windows functionality and    also includes some other miscellaneous useful classes.  Has new fancy 3D-style controls available, and support for custom controls.  Has a Windows NT version (Essential)  Redirectable graphics display/output architecture (useful for printing)  Sizer class for automatically managing control layout after resize.  Seems to be the newcomer, this could be an advantage in designing a better system. Zinc----  Has a platform independent resource strategy.  (Not too important for me right now)  Comes with a interface builder tool  Has a Windows NT version (Essential)  Seems to have been around longer (more mature), but grew up out of a DOS version.    Had a better demo :-)Both have source code availability optionsBoth are lacking OLE supportNeither seem to have any particular support for multimedia type stuffAny thoughts anyone has on this would be much appreciated,Thanks,  Brett Harperbrett.harper@cimlinc.com

 57X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]PhaNG, the Philadelphia Area NEXTSTEP User Group, will be holding a public  sneak preview of NEXTSTEP for Intel Processors.Where: David Rittenhouse Labs Room A1       33rd And Walnut, southeast corner, Philadelphia PAWhen:  Wednesday, May 5th       7 pm to 9 pm  NEXTSTEP is the 32 bit UNIX based operating environment which has, until now,only been available on Motorola-based NeXT computers. In the May 11th issueof PC Magazine called NEXTSTEP a "Hot Prospect". Now, NeXT is nearing releaseof a version of NEXTSTEP which will run on 486-based PC's, yet is identical tothe 68040 version. In fact, NEXTSTEP 3.1 includes the ability to easily compile a program into a single binary which will run on both Intel andMotorola hardware.NEXTSTEP 3.1 for Intel Processors will be demonstrated on an Epson Progression486 computer. NEXTSTEP is scheduled for release on May 25 at NeXTWorld Expoin San Francisco.The demonstration will be open to the public. Come one come all! If you are  interested in seeing the most advanced PC operating system around, come on by!For a brief summary of what NEXTSTEP offers, see the May 11th issue of PC Magazine, page 66.For more information, contact me:Jonathan HendryPhaNG, the Philadelphia Area NEXTSTEP User Group215-653-0911jon@afs.com--Jonathan W.

 15Hi,I've got an older 386/25 motherboard (old as in, uses a 1988keyboard controller, and uses memory interleaving rather than caching).It has developed a problem where trying to copy files from floppy causethe machine to lock up (reset button required), but only when in 386enhanced mode.  This occurs in Norton Desktop, File Manager, and whentrying to install software.  Running Win 3.1 in standard mode works fine.Has anyone run into this?  Any ideas?

Fixed by removing  the line STACKS=0,0 from config.sys. The default value STACKS=9,256  does just fine.- Random white pixels all over the screen when moving the mouse, in a  256 color graphical mode (the hardware cursor modes). Fixed by turning  off the hardware scroll ("24xmode scrolloff") before entering the graphics  mode. This also fixed the problem of the windowed DOS boxes under windows.  With the hardware scroll enabled, applications write garbage outside the  window.- The screensavers do not remove the cursor in 256 color modes (hardware  cursor). I don't know if this is a windows problem or a driver problem.  Clearly there should be two types of cursor removing functions: a remove-  for-draw, which can be ignored for hardware cursors and a remove-  unconditionally. Do other cards with hardware cursors have the same problem?- The VESA driver does not support the 640x480x16M TrueColor mode. (Universal  VESA drivers do not run at all).-----------DISCLAIMER: Unless otherwise stated, the above comments are entirely my own.  _____________            _____ /            /\\  __    __/    /\\/____________/  \\/ /\\  / /____/  \\            Jan van Loenen\\________    \\  /_/  \\/_/\\    \\   \\_____      Digital Equipment Corporation  /____/ \\    \\ \\ \\  /\\ \\/\\    \\  /    /\\     jvl@idca.tds.philips.nl  \\    \\/_\\    \\/\\ \\/_/ /  \\    \\/____/ /     HLDE01::LOENEN_J   \\___________/  \\____/    \\_________\\/

From what I've heard (pure hearsay) the results of outputting   TT fonts as Type 1 is _not_ as good as using high-quality Type 1 fonts in   the first place.Unless you `print' to file with the correct resolution set for thefinal output device (image setter).  A problem with TT fonts in Windowsis that they do get converted to T1 format OK, and the hinting is even usedwhile this is done, but the resulting T1 fonts are NOT hinted.  The resultis that they WILL work fine on a device of the resolution assumed by theprinter driver when the PS file is generated, but they will not lookgood when printed at a different resolution.  So when you print to an attached PS printer, with the PS driver set up forthis printer results, may be quite good.

 28Hi all,I have a DLL in which I Register a class and create a window of thatclass type.  Both calls require a module instance handle, hInstance.Petzold's 3.1 book says that it is best to use the module instancehandle of the calling program, not the module instance handle of theDLL (page 934).I have two questions:1)  Is there a way to find out the module instance handle of a module?2)  What are the possible problems with using the instance handle of    the DLL?Thanks in advance,Mike-------------------------------------------------------------------------    Mike Smith                          e-mail:  M.Smith@ma30.bull.com    Bull HN Information Systems Inc.     phone:  (508) 294-2049    300 Concord Road  MA30 - 815A          fax:  (508) 294-3807    Billerica, MA 01821  USA-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 30Here's the situation:At home, I have MS Word for windows but no printer.  At work, Ihave windows + a postscript printer, but not MS Word.  So, Iconfigure my machine at home to use a postscript printer, and usethe print to file option, which produces a nice postscript file,which I then bring to work.My question:  how do I print this postscript file through the printmanager at work? If, for example, I select print from the filemanager, it treats the postscript as a text file, and gives meseveral pages of postscript gibberish.I know that I can open a DOS window and do: copy file.ps com1:which does work, but seems not to multitask very well -- other applicationsrun rather slowly and often pause for 10's of seconds.There ought to be a way of passing the postscript file to the PrintManager, but if there is, I can't find any mention of it in thedocumentation.Anyone know how to do this?-- Michael ClaseMemorial University of Newfoundlandmclase@riemann.math.mun.ca

It's been dropped, along with BACKUP, JOIN, EDLIN   and a couple other crummy old DOS commands.

I haveused Glockenspeil commonview under Motif and OS2.  I wrote a resourceconverter from OS2 to Motif, but it really wasn't too easy, especiallythe naming scheme. In Motif you cannot rename controls/widgets.With windows you can call the OK button ID_OK in every instance,this doesn't work for Motif, you'd have to call it Dialog1_OK,and Motif expects a text string rather than a number.  So your constructor should know how to convert a #define into theproper resource identifier.I'd check on how the toolkit expects names, and that if it doesuse resources, that is uses resources for all platforms you intend toport to. ( By the way, I would never use CommonView or Glockenspielfor anything ) Alex.--__  __|       \\      __|       Alex Colburn                     |       /   \\    |          Image Analysis Facility         |      _____ \\   __|       University of Iowa          ______| _/      _\\ _|          colburn@tessa.iaf.uiowa.edu

 5NNTP-Posting-Host: mizar.usc.eduWhere's an ftp site for Trumpet?  (other than wuarchive, umich,..something off the beaten path??)Thanks.Malcolm
 42Nntp-Posting-Host: brahms.udel.eduI have uploaded the most recent Windows drivers for the Cirrus GD5426 chip based display cards to the uploads directory at ftp.cica.indiana.edu (file is 5426dr13.zip). They're very recent, I downloaded them from the Cirrus BBS (570-226-2365) last night. If you are unable to get them there, email me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well.  I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them).I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version, improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88) although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on Cirrus's part but I don't think so.From Steve Gibson's (columnist for Info World) graphic card comparisons (also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) I extracted the following for the sake of comparison:Wintach             Winbn3.11WordSprshtCadPaintOverallSteve's system:486/33 VLB:ATI Graphics Ultra Pro  9.3310.34 20.788.2814.90 13.58my system -486sx/33 VLB:VL24 Bitblaster  9.88 8.65 11.7118.8415.40 13.65Its no Viper, but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of the ATI card and when compared to the other cards included in Gibson's review.Micron system owner's, I would be interested to hear your opinions on the DTC 2270VL local bus disk controller. My system came with a Maxtor 7120 drive (120 MB) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 Kb/s, I am now at 22 Kb/s. Is this about as good as it gets? I can't get a Norton'ssysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls, at least that was what the program said.Oliver Weatherbeeoliver@earthview

 20Message-ID: <1qv5a9$9t1@menudo.uh.edu>NNTP-Posting-Host: harebell.egr.uh.eduHHHHEEEELLLLPPPP Meeeeeee!I installed a 256 color svga driver for my windows last week.   This driver was downloaded from ftp.cica.indiana.edu specifically for  Paradise svga card.  However, after I installed it and when I run windows,  the startup screen in the beginning becomes the old windows 3.0 startup  screen ????!!??!!Everything works fine except the startup screen.  I know the  startup screen must have been changed in the system.ini file (or is it ?)  but I couldn't figure out what to alter!   Can some one help me with this?   Please e-mail to my address:thang@tree.egr.uh.edu  or  thang@jetson.uh.eduIn addition, can anyone know where can I get a 1024x680 paradise svga  driver (256 color) ?  this is a used computer and I do not have anything  (drivers, etc) regarding the driver....thanks in advance.......;o)

 21Since loading Windows, two of my DOS applications have beenacting strangely.  It appears that font changes and pageorientation changes (so far) are not being recognized inWordPerfect/DOS and QuattroPro/DOS.  Another DOS applicationdoes accept font and page orientation changes, so I don'tthink the problem is with the printer.I reloaded QuattroPro, and these changes are still notaccepted whether launching from Windows or the DOS prompt.Does anyone have any suggestions as to where to look or how tocorrect this problem?  I've ordered QuattroPro for Windows,but need a landscape application printed immediately.

 25Sender: masika@bmers204 (Nicholas Masika)Reply-To: masika@bnr.caOrganization: Bell-Northern ResearchDate: Wed, 21 Apr 93 14:32:50 GMTI have just noticed my FileManager doing something strange recently.Usually, the line at the bottom of the FileManager (the status bar, Iguess) displays the total disk space and the total number of bytes forthe current selection.  If I select a whole bunch of files, I will getan exact byte count.Recently, I notice it incorrectly displays this count; it's truncating!If I select a file that is, say, 532 bytes, it correctly displays '532 bytes'.If I select select a file that is 23,482 bytes, it displays '23 bytes', not 23 Kbytes, just 23 bytes!  If I select 893,352 it will report only893 bytes in the selection.  If I select over a Meg worth of files, say3,356,345 it reports 3 bytes!  It's as if it's got a problem with displayingmore than 3 characters!My system: 486DX/33, 8M memory, Stacker 3.0, DOS 5, Win 3.1.

Just keep doing the great job you have done in the past.>Thx Dave LThis is the part that usually gets me. While I am set to make money, there usuallyare OTHER things to be considered and debated. That is the purpose of life.If you only willing to look at the stock price and sales numbers for gratification,usually you'll end up with Japanese (or whoever that is competitive) owing yourbusiness - i.e. short-sighted. IMO, this is very irresponsible, narrow minded andselfish. Henceforth, ignoring the attack is not the right approach. As a matter offact, I just happen to believe the willingness to debate and readjust is thegreatest assets of this society. Sales number and stock price is the short-termresult, not the cause.

This is much easier going from a Mac to a PC because you don't have to worryabout losing the resource fork of the file, often a problem when sending binaryfiles from a PC to a Mac.

I have been runningMathcad 3.1, under Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode, with a 5MB RAM drive,2MB/1MB Smart drive, and no swap file (permanent or temporary) forseveral months.I am interested in the faster Mathcad 4.0, but I am concerned about reportedswap file requirements and the legitimacy of Mathsoft's claim about increasedspeed.TO 386SX USERS:  Will Mathcad 4.0 run without a swap file, or insist that I use a swap file?So far, in response to a less detailed description of my setup, or inunrelated postings, the more informed answers, on the net or by E-mail,appear to be:  1) by fuess@llnl.gov (David A.

It is true that TrueType fonts arelarger than their ATM counterparts, but ATM fonts *do* get minimalcompression.

You can set up different config.sysand autoexec.bat commands for each user, and they just have to select theirmenu option on bootup.  Then you can have the autoexec.bat copy the win.iniand system.ini files and change directories for them.  When they exit windows,it can copy back generic .ini files if you want.This is the only way I can think of.

 21Hello,I'm trying to get a drum program to work that I downloaded fromftp.cica.indiana.edu in the pub/pc/win3/sounds directory.  It's calleddrum.zip.  I have an ATI Stereo FX card with the latest Windows drivers installed. When I try to run the drum program, it reports that a MIDI device is notinstalled, however the drivers utility in the control panel reports that itis installed.  Anyone have any idea how to set up the MIDI device so that the drum programwill work with my setup?  What I'm trying to do is use my computer as ametronome.  Someone suggested that I try one of the drum machines that arecirculating around out there.  Any help would be appreciated.Thanks,Terryterryh@cae.wisc.edu

 236(I have been having trouble posting this article from within tin for overa week. If you do get multiple copies, my apologies.)Here is a challenge to Microsoft or Microsort Supporters to defend thepathetic state of DOS 6 as an upgrade distribution -- it is a long storybut would make good reading for those who are interested in knowing thepotential pitfalls of "upgrading" to DOS 6 that I have been able tonotice after only about a week of playing around with it.My envorinment==============TI TravelMate 4000 WinSX (486SX/25) 4M Ram 120M DiskSystem BIOS version 1.03 05/21/92 by Texas InstrumentsCL-GD6420 VGA BIOS v 1.03 a1 by Cirrus Logic & QuadtelAdvance Power Manager BATTERY.PRO v b6.00 by Texas InstrumentsSmart Drive Cache (WIN3.1/DOS6) Parameters: 2048 1024 a- b-Windows Benchmark WinBench(tm) v 3.11 02/11/93 by ZD LabsAfter "updgrading" to DOS 6, I could not understand why certain thingsbecame so slow, especially after I decided to try 'dblspace'.  In theprocess of finding out why, I discovered some interesting things.Disk Performance with Double Space and Smart Drive==================================================While most things did not appear to slow down most of the time, certainapplications appeared to run very much slower.  What was interesting isthat commands like 'chkdsk' and 'defrag' were running far too slowly toconsider them useful by any standards.  I suspected Double Space (DS)and decided to measure its impact on my system using WinBench(tm).The Real Disk WINMARK of 20350 for the original system (as shipped fromfactory with DOS 5 and Windowws 3.1) became 10718 when "upgraded" toDOS 6 with DS.  Thus there is an effective performance degradation ofmore than 50 percent which did not really surprise me because I knewthat DS compression must cost something.Specifically, for short sequential reads up to 512 bytes, DS actually*improves* transfer rates by about 10% (because CPU being faster thanI/O, more CPU cycles needed for DS is more than compensated by savingsin I/O cycles).  However, for all other cases, particularly largerandom writes, the transfers take up to three times as long.While the performance depends on the type of access (i.e random orsequential, small or large transfer units), on the average (based onWinBench's assumptions), the disk slows down to half its speed.The tests alone, done in 'real mode' (see WinBench) and with smartdrvon, do not say much except that it helps to put into those subjectivestatements like 'there is no noticable difference in performance' oreven that 'it will speed up disk access when you have a fast CPU andslow disk I/O'.This explained why some applications ran markedly slower, but not why'chkdsk' and 'defrag' (the latter especially) too so long.Double Space and Windows========================DBLSPACE will not run at all from within windows, not even if youwanted to only to get information, not modify anything, or for thatmatter even check on its usage -- try "fasthelp dblspace" in a dos boxwithin windows and you will see what I mean from the error message youget.  How narrow minded can a programer get, I wonder.Yes, this information can be obtained through the mstools.dd add-on tofile manager, but this 'mstools' dll does not understand a compressedfloppy!  (Use the DOS 6 supplement utility to create a compressedfloppy if you dont know how to.)DOS 6 Defragmenter is incompatible with TI APM==============================================Defragmentation seemed to take too much time.  Even so, I waitedpatiently till it finished and then ran it again to just to confirm.This confirmation 'dblspace /def' command for the 120M drive should takeno more than 30 seconds (much faster on other defragmenters I have used)but it took 12 minutes.I discovered that if I moved the mouse, defragmentation checking ranfaster (the % figure ticked more rapidly).  It dawned on me that thishad to do with TI's battery saver Advanced Power Management (APM)module which slows the clock down when it thinks that the CPU is idle,and it obviously thought DS defragmentation was an idle process!  Afterdisabling the TI's power saver, this operation took only 20 seconds.Microsft programmers think TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD users are idiots====================================================================In the readme.txt file, you can find the the followingRunning Microsoft Backup with TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD computers----------------------------------------------------------------To avoid a conflict between the Turbo feature and Microsoft Backupfor Windows or MS-DOS, add a /L0 switch to the DEVICE command inyour CONFIG.SYS that loads the BATTERY.PRO file. Or, before yourun Microsoft Backup, type SETPOWER /L0 at the command prompt.If you checked TI's manual on the /L0 option, you will realise that itmeans "disable all power saving features of your notebook".  Why wouldanyone want to run a driver disabled!  As I have found out, not onlydoes TI's power management interfere with Microsoft Backup as thereadme.txt claims, but 'chkdsk' and 'dblspace' (and who knows whatelse) are crippled by the TI's power saver.It is obvious that there is not such thing as APM specifications.  Ifthere indeed is such a thing, then either Microsoft programmers or TIprogrammers dont know how to read these specifications.  You dont haveto guess as to who are the idiots.By the way, if you run the advance power management utility, POWER.EXEin DOS6, when you check the status, it says:Power Management Status-----------------------Setting =  ADV: MAXCPU: idle 60% of time.This figure of 60% seems to be the steady state value on my notebookwhen I am running nothing (windows with only program manager iniconised form).  Does that mean that Windows takes up 40% of my CPU allfor itself, and that I have at best only 60% left for useful work?  Issuch an overhead justified  (whether or not Windows is an operatingsystem or just another user interface)?  (In DOS alone, it reports 99%idle time.)  Looks like Windows is a good example of busy waiting typeof package that I like my students to study as the classical 'negative'example of our times!Microsoft programmers do not know batch programming===================================================I like to structure my startup script and thus have the equivalent ofaddpath statements like this:set PATH=C:\\DOS...set PATH=C:\\ETC\\BIN;%PATH%;C:\\BIN...set PATH=C:\\ETC\\WINDOWS;%PATH%;C:\\WINDOWS...set PATH=%PATH%;C:\\BCC\\BIN...set PATH=%PATH%;%MOUSE%Even though the new dos was installed in the same directory as the oldone (i.e. c:\\dos), DOS 6 installation program modifes each and everypath statement, and prepends C:\\DOS to its value.  As a result, myresultant path has so many DOS's.If the installation program wanted to remove the old DOS path, and addthe new DOS path, clearly it has to only scan for the path statementcontaing the old DOS directory and replace it by the new DOS path.(Even this should only be done if the new DOS is installed in adirectory different from the old one being 'upgraded'.)Instead, the Microsoft programmer (if you can call this person one)decided to meddle every path statement I had in the autoexec andprepend DOS to the value.  I wonder if Microsoft is so desparate that itwould not fire programmers who are incapable of the thought process.I started a thread on this when DOS 4 came up, and the Microsoftrepresentative in Singapore called me about this poster.  In fact hespecifically said his US counterparts saw the poster and relayed theinformation to him as he did not have access to internet.Now that has not changed one bit.  In fact, if you have a PATH statementwith %PATH% already in it, is it not obvious that the this statementshould not be touched for any reason?As another example of the inability of Microsoft programmers tounderstand batch programming -- I had the mouse driver invoked as:set MOUSE=C:\\ETC\\MOUSEset PATH=%PATH%;%MOUSE%loadhigh %MOUSE%\\MOUSE.COMGuess what MEMMAKER did?  It replaced the last statement withLH ... C:\\ETC\\MOUSE\\MOUSE.COMWhy is it so difficult just to replace loadhigh with LH and itsparameters, without touching the rest of the line, I do not understand.DOS 6 Software Quality======================DOS 6 is the only operating system I know, in which, under normal usage,you end up creating a file that you cannot get rid of using of thecommands that come with it.I am deliberately being cryptic about this:  I challenge Microsoft touse all its programmers to catch this bug and publish it.  If they dontwithin a week, I will post how you can create this "ghost" file.Surely if I can pick this bug without even looking for it after using aparticular command only twice, I am sure two dozen Microsoft (idiot)programmers randomly banging on their keyboards over a week could findit -- that is what I was told how Microsoft "tests the quality" oftheir products.I think it is funny that Microsoft has found ways to "test quality"when it is accepted in the industry that quality cannot be tested, butcan only be built into the product.  No wonder they cannot provide anyform of guarantees on their products, not even a decent list of bugsthat will prevent scores of user from destroying their disks beyondrepair!Also, if you run 'dblspace /def' often enough, repeatedly when the diskis fully defragmented, you may get errors, that was created by thedefragmenters.  I got my IO.SYS file size error and it got truncatedwhen I did the chkdsk.  This happend only after five successivedefragmentation efforst after the first one supposedly did its job andwith no new file creation since.Microsft, dont you dare reply to this poster on the network until youadmit that your DS has bugs, and are willing to let us know what weshould watch out for if we have already used DS.Jaya--Dr. Jayasooriah  CSE, CS&E, UNSW | Sign in a Paris hotel:                    P.O.

 14Somewhere in this thread, it has been said that Windows NT (tm) is a multi-user OS, as well as multi-threading, etc.  I certainly haven'tseen this to be the case.  There are seperate accounts for each person,and even seperate directories if that is desired.  I don't see an implentation of simultaneuos use though.Scott-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Scott Reimert  \\    reimert@mamacass.etdesg.trw.com     /Standard disclaimer:Redondo Beach, CA \\______________________________________/"Blah blah blah ...

It was quite a while ago.  *********************************************Richard Calderon:  rcaldrn@epi.med.miami.edu*University of Miami School of Medicine      *Information Systems Computing               *1029 NW 15 St.                              *Miami, Florida 33136                        **********************************************

Apparantly the problem only occurs when TAB charactersare used immediately preceding the equation frame.  The work around whenequations are expected to touch the right margin is to delete at least onepreceding TAB and use SPACE to align the frame (or use set frame whereplaced w/no text wrap around).  Unforutnately, once the page run-on hasoccured you are hosed. So the moral of the story is use only SPACE charactersto align equation frames.Hope this helps the rest of you who have already contacted me with this problem.Kurtnagel@fido.colorado.edu

If this is true why does windows report the memory is>available to me if it's not going to use it?I think the support droid was malfunctioning and confused the disk spacelimit with the virtual address space limit.  As far as the disk isconcerned, you are limited only by the amount of contiguous free space.The limit that causes the message, "Windows will only use ...," is theamount of virtual address space that the Virtual Memory Manager willcreate, and this is a function of the amount of free memory that you havewhen Windows starts.In the [386enh] section of SYSTEM.INI, you can specify a parameter:PageOverCommit=multiplierThe following description is from the Windows Resource Kit:This entry specifies the multiplier what determines the amount oflinear address space the VMM will create for the system, which iscomputed by rounding up the amount of available physical memory tothe nearest 4 MB and then multiplying that value by the valuespecified for PageOverCommit=.  Increasing this value increases theamount of available linear address space, causing the size of datastructures to increase.  This also increases paging activityproportionately and can slow down the system.  You can specify avalue between 1 and 20.  The default is 4.  To change this entry,you must edit SYSTEM.INI.--Bob NicholsAT&T Bell Laboratoriesrnichols@ihlpm.ih.att.com

 18Hi, I am using a dtk 386-20Mhz 13Meg memory to run a variety ofprograms, and have had problems off and on with lock up,but now I am trying to run an application that wants a lot of memoryover a period of time (Playmation 24 bit rendered) and it is locking up Everytime.  I have an ATI ultra + w/2Meg which I havetried in each of the video modes, I have excluded the region ofvideo memory from A000-C800 segments from the use of emm386,have tried adjusting the swap partion from large to nonexistant (toprevent swapping) and I have REM'd ALL TSR's and utilities in config.syusand autoexec, and even tried using the default program manager, disablingmy HP dashboard.  even with a minimal system, no swap, no smartdrv,no TSR's, no windows utilities and exclusion of video regions it stilllocks up completely (no mouse control, no response to anything except3finger salute, and even that does not stop by the standard windowsscreen, but simply does a full reset immediately).

What I have seen from the March Beta isthat it doesn't yet come with the stuff which exploits multi-userfeatures. I remember somebody from MS stating that it doesn't allowtwo users share one GUI. My interpretation of this was that one userper console but all the networking and RPC based stuff you want. I believe ftp and rlogin deamons for NT systems will come from thirdparty. Somebody already has a Beta version of an unsecure ftpd on thenet. There is no reason why one cannot write a posix based shell likecsh on Unix for remote logins. In general I liked NT when I checked it out. It slow compared toWin3.1 (just like any other real OS). The beta version, although beingslow, botts up much faster than my SUN workstation. Windows subsystemsalso start up a lot faster than X windows. I believe Bill Gates wasright when he stated that NT was not for everybody. After playingaround with it for a while I was convinced. If I owned a busines usinga "business computer" from IBM or some other established vendor, Iwould consider moving to NT platform because it would provide a muchcheaper solution (If you are running SQL servers etc.). It providesthe robustness such an application requires. On the other hand if you like your DOS games, more or less forgetabout NT. You can always boot to DOS  but in general that defeatsthe purpose of using NT. Most of NT's features are visible in anetworked environment and in such an environment you can't reboot yourmachine at will. For personal use, I would rather wait for the Win32based Windows release (whatever you name it) than jump to NT bandwagon.I expect most applications will keep on using Win16 until Win32becomes widely available. --Sadun Anik, U of Illinois at Urbana-ChampaignCenter for Reliable and High-performance Computinge-mail: anik@crhc.uiuc.edu

The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I  There is a way in SYS.INI to turn off RAM parity checking (unfortunately,my good Windows references are at home, but any standard Win referencewill tell you how to do it.

 22I have just added a Panasonic KP-X1123 24pin dot matrix printer to a 386sx/25. I installedthe appropriate Windows 3.1 printer driver (i.e. one specifically for this printer) but I'munable to persuade the poxy thing to print correctly.  What appears to be happening is that the TrueType fonts don't get printed properly. Myexperiments show that all graphic images (for example a line drawing from Corel Draw) printok. GraphicsWorkshop for Windows happily prints GIFs etc. MS Notepad and MS Write willprint correctly providing the font's in the text are printer fonts.  When I print TrueType fonts, some lines appear to be printed in the wrong order. If I change the text font to a printer font, the problem is eliminated. I have tried using printer drivers for printers which the KX-P1123 (snappy name) emulates,namely Epsom LQ-850 and IBM ProPrinter X24 and the same problem occurs. If there is some kind soul who can tell me just what the hell is going on, I would be most chuffed.  David H.
 18I would like to change all of the system fonts in windows... I have a program that will generate system fonts from truetype, but i was wondering if there is a problem to help you set up all your systemfonts.Also, how do i change the icon text color... all of my icon text is black,and i want to change it... couldn't find any options in control panel orin win.inibrad  cainbrad@bach.udel.edu-- ****************************************************************************brad@bach.udel.edu             Brad Cain        N3NAFcain@snow-white.ee.udel.edu    University of Delaware Electrical Engineeringcain@freezer.cns.udel.edu      "Blah, blah, blah"                   alt.blah

I found a copy somewhere in wuarchive.wustl.edua long time ago, but I don't know offhand what directory it was under.  It'sGREAT at converting files of all types, including Mac, NExT, Sun, andvarious PC formats... It's also a great player and editor, with variousspecial effects that put Windows' Sound Recorder to shame.  It requires adriver for various sound cards...

 17In Windows I created a permanent Swap-file of 7771Kb as win3.1recommended me to do that (32bit access).If I use EMM386.EXE, after win3.1 startup I have 6689K of memoryfree, if I leave EMM386.EXE out of my config.sys I have 9935Kof memory free, and windows recommends me a swap file of 11769K.I use DOS6, with memmaker, have 4MB of internal Memory and a 486DX,Does anybody knows why this is happening (possibly win needssome UMB's to manage virtual memory?, If true, which UMB's, thosethat EMM386 can find without including suspicious parts?)I need an optimized DOS-environment, because i develop applications forDOS using a windows programming environment.Rudi

 24ok, i have a 486dx50(ISA) w/ Diamond Stealth VRAM 1MB.I was really satisfied w/ its performance in windows.but now more and more games needs higher frame rates in DOS' VGA,especially this new Strike Commander. ;-)this stealth vram can only give me 17.5 fps. ;-( (i use 3dbench).my winmark was 6.35 million, i think.so right now i'm considering to replace it w/ a new card, which hopefullycan perform approx same w/ my current VRAM in windows and alsocan perform DOS' VGA preferably >30fps.i also saw the 3dbench benchmark list from someone who compiled itin csipg and it looked that SpeedStar 24X and Orchid Prodesigner 2d-sware the fastest for non local bus motherboard.both can give >30fps in DOS' VGA w/ 486dx2/66.Does anyone have a winmarks for both of those cards above with the processortype ? which one is the worthiest(not necessarily fastest)?any other card recommendation is welcomed too.also, if possible, where can i get 'this' card for the cheapest? ;-)thanks in advance, folks!===Martin
 468Distribution: compMessage-ID: <ashok.687.0@biochemistry.cwru.edu>NNTP-Posting-Host: axa12-slip.dialin.cwru.eduSummary: How to get SLIP going on your PC ....Keywords: SLIP, PHONE, CSLIPPER, WinQVT/netI have been posting monthly "how-to-setup a SLIP client on a PC" posts for a few months.  Lots of work, and imminent graduation have come in the way of posting one of these for March or earlier this month -- for which I apologize.This file includes information on writing a script for University of MinnesotaPHONE, and also a batch file hack that lets you use other packet drivers with PHONE. For additions, modifications and corrections, I can be reached at<ashok@biochemistry.cwru.edu>Best wishes,Ashok-- begin SLIP.TXT --Based on my experiences on setting up SLIP under DOS and Windows,  hereare my comments on setting up SLIP in this environment.  I thank theTrumpet beta testers and the CWRU SLIP beta testers for their comments.----------------------------------------------------------------------Configuring your Modem:a) Turn off DTR (AT&D0&W)   I have to disable DTR because the communication program that I use   to dial my SLIP server (QMODEM) drops DTR when I exit the program   and therefore hangs up the line.  If you use a program like Kermit   or Conex to establish the SLIP connection, then this need not be done.   These programs do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit.   NOTE: If you use Univ. of Minn. PHONE to dial and establish a         SLIP connection, you do not need to turn off DTR.b) Dial and establish the SLIP connection first.  This can be done   automatically if you use a program like PHONE (from the University of   Minnesota) which will dial and establish a SLIP connection then load the   SLIP packet driver.  The PHONE scripting language is simple and   phone scripts can be easily written to configure PHONE to work with   other SLIP server.  In addition, while the only packet driver   that PHONE works with is UMSLIP (currently), it is easy to write a   batch file hack that lets PHONE work with other packet drivers.   There is a section on PHONE in the document with both script and   batch file examples.----------------------------------------------------------------------Configuring the SLIP drivers:There are five SLIP packet drivers commonly availableCSLIPPER.EXE    Peter Tattam's compressed SLIP driverSLIPPER.EXE     Peter Tattam's SLIP driverSLIP8250.COM    Crynwr driver (I like Phil Burn's modified driver)ETHERSL.COM     Crynwr driver (ethernet simulation over SLIP)UMSLIP.COM      Univ. of Minnesota driver (based on SLIP8250)Of these four, I vastly prefer C/SLIPPER.EXE over SLIP8250.COM orETHERSL.COM for the following reasons:a) It is much faster even though my modem has just a 16450 UARTb) While using EtherSLIP/SLIP8250/UMSLIP, myself and several others   have noticed that the PC clock gets messed up after performing a   long FTP transfer.c) It supports PKTMUX when used in ethernet simulation moded) When used in Ethernet simulation mode C/SLIPPER seem to work with   every TCP/IP application that I have tested it with.Instructions for C/SLIPPER.EXE (and you do not use PHONE)a) Load SLIPPER in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file according to instructions:   For instance if you have a v.32bis modem on COM1   slipper com1 vec=62 baud=57600b) If you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Win 3.1 DOS boxes, then use the   double-ended packet driver shim WinPKT.COM -- this creates a virtual   packet driver at 0x60.  DOS applications in native mode, DOS   applications in Windows 3.1 DOS boxes and Windows applications can all   use this virtual driver at 0x60.   winpkt.com 0x60 0x62c) If you use QVT/Net, load PKTINT.COM next.  QVT/net is configured in   QVTNET.INI to use the interrupt at 0x60.   pktint.comInstructions for SLIP8250.COM:a) Try getting a version 10 SLIP driver.  Philip Burns of Northwestern   University has a modified SLIP8250.COM driver that is better at hardware   handshaking.  This driver is distributed along with NuPOP.b) Load the driver AFTER establishing the SLIP connection.  My modem is a   V.32bis modem on COM1, so here is how I would load the driver.   slip8250 -w 0x62 -h 4 SLIP 0x03f8 57600c) As discussed above if you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Windows 3.x   DOS boxes, you probably want to use WINPKT.COM   winpkt.com 0x60 0x62d) If you use WinQVT/net, load PKTINT.COM   pktint.comInstructions for ETHERSL.COM:If you choose to use ETHERSL.COM instead of SLIP8250.COM, theinstructions are exactly the same with one crucial difference.  Youwill have to DELETE the line "device=*vcd" from the [386Enh] sectionof SYSTEM.INI.  This will interfere with running regular Windows Commapplications (such as Crosstalk), and you will get lots of droppedcharacters etc. in these applications.  This is therefore notrecommended.  ETHERSLIP would be loaded as:   ethersl -w 0x62 -h 4 0x03f8 57600----------------------------------------------------------------------Configuring Windows 3.1:a) Make the following modifications to the SYSTEM.INI file [386Enh]   section.   i) List all your COM ports, with their addresses and interrupts.       COM1Base=03F8       COM1Irq=4       COM2Base=02F8       COM2Irq=3       COM3Base=03E8       COM3Irq=5       This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel,       but double-clicking on the "Ports" icon.   ii) Give the port to which your modem is attached a generous COM buffer       COM1Buffer=10000   iii) Change the COM port AutoAssign value for the COM port that you wish       to use for your modem to ZERO.  This is the amount of time that       Windows waits in seconds before handing control of that COM port to       another application.  If you use WinQVT/net and then want to switch       from one session to another, and this value is at the default value       of 2 seconds, you are will get a GPF and Windows will crash.       COM1AutoAssign=0       This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel.       Double-click on 386 Enhanced, and under "Device Contention", set       the device contention for the COM port your modem is on to       "Never Warn"----------------------------------------------------------------------Additional notes:----------------------------------------------------------------------What to do if you are assigned a different IP address for eachSLIP session?I am fortunate in that our campus SLIP server assigns each usera permanent IP address, so I do not have worry about editing QVTNET.INIeach time that I establish a SLIP connection.If you are assigned a new IP address on every occasion that you dial in,please try to use BOOTP aware software, and let BOOTP do theconfiguration for you.  However, QVTnet is not BOOTP aware and RARPwill not work over a SLIP connection.  To get QVTNet working in asituation such as this, you must do the following:Edit the QVTNET.INI file.  Let the [net] section look like this:[net]name=ip=netmask=255.255.255.0 (or whatever is appropriate for you)arptime=20packet_vector=60 (or whatever is appropriate)Save the changes, and then *write-protect* this file"attrib +r qvtnet.ini"Start your slip connection, and *remember* the name and IP addressthat you are assigned.  Each time you start QVT/net 3.1x, thegeneral configuration dialog box will open.  Enter the name andIP address and you were assigned for that session, click on [OK],and you should be up and running.  The changes you make will notbe saved, as QVTNET.INI is write-protected.A more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic SLIP IP addressassignment is provided by Victor Menayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu)Victor uses the program bootpq to semi-automate qvtnet preparation.Bootpq is used to inquire the assigned IP, which is then saved to afile called "myip".  Another file "noip" is essentially a completeQVTNET.INI file that lacks the IP address.  In the final step "myip"and "noip" are copied into a single QVTNET.INI file.  An example ofVictor's batch file is provided below:=====================================================slipper com2pktint.combootpq -i "ip=\\"%%s\\""  >> myipbootpq -i "My IP# is: %s"copy /q net + myip + noip e:\\com\\qvtnet\\qvtnet.inidel /q myip@echo offecho .echo Ready to run WinQVTnet=====================================================For questions and more details about bootpq, please contact VictorMenayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu)QPC Software is attempting to add BOOTP capability to WinQVT/net.----------------------------------------------------------------------How do you use PKTMUX over SLIP?PKTMUX will not work over the SLIP8250.COM packet driver, and crashesimmediately if used with ETHERSL.COMPKTMUX will work with C/SLIPPER.EXE, when C/SLIPPER is used in ethernetsimulation mode.  An example of this configuration is shown below:The latest release of PKTMUX is 1.2c; and it is important that youuse this version, if you want to use virtual packet drivers withapplications like Trumpet for Windows (to be released very shortly).[from AUTOEXEC.BAT]lh c/slipper com1 vec=65 baud=57600 ether         (packet driver)lh pktmux 5 65 /5       (pktmux loaded for 5 virtual packet drivers)lh pktdrv 7f 65         (first virtual packet driver used for QVT/net)lh pktint.com           (QVT/net pktint.com)pktdrv 63 65            (PKTDRV for use in native DOS or WinTrumpet)Additional virtual packet drivers can be loaded directly from withinWindows 3.1 DOS boxes.  For example, my PIF file to load POPmail isdirected to the file "popmail.bat".  This is what popmail.bat readslike:pktdrv 60 65            loads a virtual packet driver at 0x60cd \\popmailpopmailcd \\pktdrv 60 /u            unloads the packet driver at 0x60exit                    causes the DOS window to closeI have similar batch files that load other DOS TCP/IP applicationslike PC Gopher.  It is my experience that PKTMUX works fineeven if the virtual packet drivers in two independent virtual DOSsessions, are loaded at the same software interrupt.  For examplewithin two different DOS boxes -- one for POPmail and the other forGopher, the virtual packet driver (pktdrv) is loaded at 0x60 in eachinstance.----------------------------------------------------------------------How much does PKTMUX degrade the performance of C/SLIPPER?I have a V.32bis/V.42bis modem in a 386-33 running Windows 3.1 witha reasonably fast video card (ATI Graphics Ultra).  Under theseconditions, when I have three virtual packet drivers loaded andbeing used as follows:a) Driver at 0x7f -- QVTNet FTP client sessionb) Driver at 0x60 in one DOS Window -- CUTCP tn3270 sessionc) Driver at 0x60 in another DOS Window -- Trumpet for DOSI get FTP transfer rates of 0.8 - 1.0 kb/sec while transferringcompressed files.  This rate is comparable to that which I get withSLIP8250 loaded as a packet driver, and where a single TCP/IP sessionis active.  If CSLIPPER is used a packet driver and a single sessionis active, I get transfer rates of 1.3 - 1.4 kb/sec on the samefiles.While there is about 40% degradation in the performance of SLIPPER,for me the benefits of being able to use PKTMUX outweigh theperformance hit.----------------------------------------------------------------------C/SLIPPER and ethernet simulation modeIn ethernet simulation mode, C/SLIPPER ver 1.3 works with all theapplications that I have tested it with.  One or two applicationsthat required ethernet simulation balked at C/SLIPPER 1.2, but eventhese rare problems have been resolved with ver 1.3When SLIPPER is used in ethernet simulation mode, and used with PKTMUX,I get some an error message in the QVTNet Console window that reads"IP:incorrect packet type" or "IP:bad version number".  This does notseem to prevent QVTnet from functioning, although I cannot comment onloss of performance.----------------------------------------------------------------------What can you do if your DOS TCP/IP application does not work withC/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode?In the rare event that you find a package that does not work withC/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode, first contact the author --Peter Tattam -- PETER@psychnet.psychol.utas.edu.au, and let himknow.  Chances are that he can fix it.In the meanwhile, you can try the following.  I do not know if it iskosher, but it worked when I had problems with C/SLIPPER ver 1.2(C/SLIPPER is loaded at 0x62 as described above under the PKTMUX section)I load ETHERSL.COM at 0x60, run the application and then terminateETHERSL.COMThis also works within Windows 3.1 virtual DOS boxes.  However apacket driver like ETHERSL can be used in only one virtual DOS boxat a time.So for example, here is my batch file to run Grateful Med (amedical reference retrieval program developed at the National Libraryof Medicine).ethersl -w 0x60 -h 4 0x03f8 57600       loads ETHERSLIPcd \\gm6searchcd \\termin 0x60                             terminates ETHERSLIPexit            closes the DOS box and returns me to WindowsIf you use this method, be cautious about one thing -- don't haveany active PKTMUX DOS sessions open at the same time.  After closingthe ETHERSL window, you can run your PKTMUX DOS sessions with noproblem.  BTW, the example above -- Grateful Med, works with noproblems with C/SLIPPER ver 1.3----------------------------------------------------------------------PHONE Script Files:The documentation that accompany PHONE, provide good instructions onwriting script files to get PHONE to dial SLIP servers other thanthe University of Minnesota server.  For example here is a scriptthat I use to dial a CISCO server at the University that I attend.Background:  To start a SLIP connection, I dial our terminal server,and login with a username and password.  After doing so, I start a SLIPsession with the following command "slip username-slip.dialin.cwru.edu",followed by my password -- again.Here then is the relevant portion of the PHONE.CMD script file -## CWRU-TS2 SLIP login script by Ashok Aiyar 3/26/93# Last revised 3/28/93Procedure    Host.CWRU.LoginTimeOut 60      'CWRU-TS2 terminal server is not responding'Message         "CWRU-TS2 SLIP login script -- Version 1.1"Message         'Waiting for SLIP server to respond'Quiet ONExpect 'Verification'Message         'Request for User Verification Received from CWRU-TS2'Message         'Sending your user name and password'Quiet OFFExpect   'Username:'Send '%u<'Expect   'Password:'PrivateSend '%p<'Reject    'Access denied'   'Your user name or password was not accepted'TimeOut 30    'SLIP server did not respond to your validation request'Expect 'CWRU-TS2>'Send 'SLIP<'TimeOut 10    'SLIP server did not respond to SLIP command'Expect 'IP hostname or address:'Send '%u-slip.dialin.cwru.edu<'TimeOut 10 'SLIP server did not respond to hostname'Reject    'Bad IP address'   'Incorrect Hostname'Expect 'Password:'Send '%p<'Reject    'Access denied'    'Password not accepted.'TimeOut 10Expect 'Header Compression will match your system'Message 'Login to CWRU SLIP server successful'Wait 1.0EndProcedure   Host.CWRU.Login##Procedure      Host.CWRU.LogOut# Nothing special needs to be done to logoutEndProcedure   Host.CWRU.LogOut##   End of Script file#----------------------------------------------------------------------How to use packet drivers other than UMSLIP with PHONE?The quick answer -- there is no "clean" way.  Below is a batch filehack that I wrote to use PHONE with other packet drivers.  In thisexample, the packet driver is Peter Tattam's CSLIPPER.  To use abatch file like this, you must know the parameters with which youplan to use the packet driver -- i.e interrupt vector, baud rate,port address, and IRQ.  This batch file requires UMSLIP.COM,CSLIPPER.EXE, and TERMIN.COM to be in the same directoryor in your path ...All that the BATCH file does is to let you dial the SLIP connectionusing PHONE, load the appropriate packet driver, hangup theconnection, and unload the driver when you are done ...-- being CWRUSLIP.BAT --@echo offrem   this batch file is an ugly hack of U. of Minn.

 27Somebody help me cure my poor computer before I go insane!I have a problem with my 486 when running windows that appearsto be memory-related.  It's actually not limited to windows, butthat's where it causes most of my problems.  Ths machine's 486DX33,8Meg RAM, 256Kcache, TRIDENT TVGA card, PAS-16 soundcard.1)  Windows runs REALLY, REALLY slow most of the time.  Slower thanon my old 386SX16.  Graphics draws/fills are slow, boots are slow,applications are sluggish, dialog boxes take up to 15 seconds to appear.(Note: some of my other non-windows applications do funny things thatappear to be related.  Several run slow, my .mod player crashes thesystem etc..)2) Running Borland C++ 3.0 before running windows (or any of the otherprograms)  COMPLETELY fixes the problem.  Windows will run as fast asI've ever seen it run, easily 10 times faster for graphics thanwhen I don't run BC beforehand.3)  I don't have a memory manager installed in config.sys.

Explain how your examples>fit that criterion.Hmm...has anyone of us computer geeks (me included) ever considerthat inovation is not limited to software/hardware.  True, MSproducts do not boast features that MS invented, but how many productsout there by other vendors out there are truely innovative intheir continuing development? I think what makes MS special to the public is thier innovative pricing.It is true the XWindows/MAC/NEXT all have some feature(s) in thier GUIthat are better than MS.  But people like me can't afford them.It is true that Apple has lower their pricing on the low end models..but they are just that...low end.  System 7 is a better operatingsystem, but the machines they operate on just are too expensive formy tastes...A UNIX platform is powerful enuf, but tell the commonuser to set up .Xdefault (i am still confused on what some of them things do) and they either puke or faint.  If u think about it, low prices aint innovative if u come down to it.  Butfor the product it offers and on the lower cost (and powerful hardwarethat it runs on as compare to macs)....MS is kinda innovative..Oh yea, I guess the fact that the support products and applicationsthey have garnered for MSWindows does make them kinda innovative too..>   Dixon D.

 21Help, I'm bored with the current Windows backgrounds we have here and am looking for some nifty pictures to use instead.  I've seen from previous poststhat many sites exist that store pictures - available through anonymous ftp.Except that I can't ftp to remote sites from my machine, what I CAN do is use'ftpmail' - mail a list of commands to a server and receive a mail of files, and/or data back.Does anyone know of sites, with Windows compatible pictures, that can be accessed in such a way??? If you do would you please post them.TIA   Mark.PS.

The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker. If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get thecharacters in the font of orgin.

You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT fontfile (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the charactersappropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on.Well, yes, both Type 1 and TrueType fonts can contain lots of characters.And in both cases plain text fonts will be reencoded to Windows ANSIin Windows, and to Mac standard roman encoding on the Mac. No difference there between T1 and TT!   And as for fonts with thousands of glyphs, right know these are a liabiliatyrather than a great new thing.  Reason is that a font with 3000 charactersis very large, and if you can only access 224 of them you are paying a heavyprice in downloading time and printer storage.  (And at the moment thereis only one program of that uses `partial font downloading')For instance, all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windowschar set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that if the fontis brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full macchar set. Yes and T1 text fonts all have the `ISO Adobe' character set, which isa superset of Windows ANSI and Macintosh standard roman enocding.The question is whether you can get at the glyphs.  In Windows, for example,you cannot get at the ligatures `fi' anfd `fl' (both T1 and TT)even though afont may very well have them.ANd, while it is somewhat painful to reencode a Type 1 font and to create anew Windows metric file (PFM) for it, there are utilities out there to allowyou do this.  How do I reencode a TrueType font?  How can I get at the`fi' and `fl' ligatures in Windows (or on the Mac)?  Are there utilitiesthat make it possible to circumvent the hard-wired Windows ANSI encoding?   > Regards,                                            1001-A East Harmony Road   > Bob Niland                                          Suite 503   > Internet:  rjn@csn.org                              Fort Collins CO 80525   > CompuServe: 71044,2124                              (303) 223-5209Berthold K.P.

 15A friend of mine uses Windows 3.1 to do most of her work.Unfortunately, she has very bad eyesight, and we haven'tbeen able to figure out how to change the default fontused by the system and application menus, or the font usedby the Help program (what use is hypertext if you can'tread it?) to make it legible to her.If anyone knows how to increase the size of these fonts,of any software package that makes Windows more accessibleto visually handicapped people, please let me know.Thanks,Dan

Both Type 1 and TT fonts can be of excellent quality and poor qualityat any size. It all depends on the font's maker and the complexity of the glyphsrelated to the size and resolution at which they are viewed. Probably the reasonfor your opinion/experience that TT is inferior is because most TT fonts on themarket today have been converted from Type 1 outlines to TT either by the fontvendor or end-users using Fontographer or FontMonger instead of the TT fonts beinghand-hinted to take advantage of the TT hinting language. At best these convertedTT fonts will be on a par with the Type 1 font of its orgin.TrueType is a much richer and more robust hinting language than Type 1 (the hintingof diagonals for instance, which TT does and Type 1 cannot). If you check out theWindows 3.1 core fonts (Times, Arial, Courier, Symbol, Wingdings) you'll see what canbe done with TT. There are other fonts out there that have been hand-hinted and notjust converted. Some of the Microsoft TT Font Pack 2 fonts are hinted very well.> You can use both TT and ATM fonts at the same time, if you like.> ATM (Type 1) fonts tend to be of higher quality> and be more complete in terms of foreign characters.Again, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker. If someoneconverts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the characters in the font of orgin. TTallows for much more flexibility in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphsin a TT font file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters appropriatefor the particular platform you are running the font on.

It is extremely easy to use, make reports, etc.  Iown both it and Paradox, and I almost never use Paradox.  If you need to build up a complicated application, then Paradox is the way to go.  I haveheard horror stories about the Access programming being extremely cryptic.Since you seem like you will probably be doing fairly small stuff (work/home use and you have not used a database before), I recommend Approach.  I have found only one small thing which I would like it to do more easily:I have one database where the order in which the records are entered must be different than what is the logical ordering.  To permanently reorder (to use the old DBASE III command) the records requires sorting the records appropriately (no problem, since I almost always use them in this order)exporting the database to another database (which can still be an Approach database), and then copying the exported files back to the original filename.  This is a small weakness, considering the other items I really like about Approach.  It is also a little slower than Paradox (other than the loading, Paradox takes forever and a minute to load).  Paradox also takes a lot of memory (both hard disk (around 12MB) and RAM).Greg Bishop. (bishop@baeyer.chem.fsu.edu)

I had the same problem.  At first, I thought it was the video driver and   made sure I had the most current drivers, because the problem was most  evident at SVGA resolution modes.  It didn't help and after a bit of  experimentation, determined that the problem existed in standard VGA  resolution mode. It was just much less noticeable.    My mouse was an older MS serial version I bought second hand in 1990. It  worked just fine in DOS and DOS based graphic applications.  On the   guess that the problem was with the resolution of the mouse, I borrowed  a new mouse (a MS bus model) and tried it.  That solved the problem.  So, if your mouse is old, you may want to try replacing it for a newer  one.  >--->Sean Eckton>Computer Support Representative>College of Fine Arts and Communications>D-406 HFAC>Brigham Young University>Provo, UT  84602>(801)378-3292>hfac_csr@byu.edu>ecktons@ucs.byu.edu-- signoff------------------------------------------------------------------------------Russ Lister  rlister@cti.com  -or-  {well connected systen}!uunet!cti1!rlister Comprehensive Technologies Int'l Inc., Arlington, VA==============================================================================
