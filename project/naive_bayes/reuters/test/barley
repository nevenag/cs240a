seasons as follows, in thousand tonnes unless stated --
 (A) - Firm sales to a declared destination.
 (B) - Ultimate destination not yet declared.
 (C) - Sales made on exporters' own account.
 (D) - Exporter holds option to fill commitment with supplies 
from origins other than U.S.
 (E) - Accumulated exports since season began based on data 
reported by exporters.
 (F) - Indicated total for season.
 (G) - USDA-projected exports for season.

Private exporters reported sales of

Italy's barley crop is generally in good
condition and harvesting is expected to begin shortly, the
agricultural marketing information and research board Irvam
said.
    First consignments were expected to be available around
mid-June.
    Excellent weather, characterised by alternating periods of
sunshine and rain, has encouraged growth except in Sardinia,
which was expected to lose a large part of its barley crop
because of extreme dryness.
    Irvam said yields are expected higher than last year's low
levels if favourable weather continues in the next few weeks.
    Given an average yield of 3.5 tonnes per hectare, national
production would be around two pct higher than in the previous
season at just above 1.6 mln tonnes, it said.
    If yields reach the record 3.78 tonnes per hectare achieved
in 1984, production would be around 1.75 mln tonnes, an
increase of 11 pct compared to 1986.

The Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC,
has accepted bids for export bouses to cover sales of 150,000
tonnes of U.S. barley to Saudi Arabia, the U.S. Agriculture
Department said.
    The CCC accepted three bonus offers from one exporter which
averaged 40.88 dlrs per tonne, it said.
    The barley is for delivery August 15-November 30 in three
shiments of 50,000 tonnes each.
    The bonus awards were made to Louis Dreyfus Corporation and
will be paid in the form of commodities from CCC stocks.
    An additional 350,000 tonnes of U.S. barley are still
available to Saudi Arabia under the Export Enhancement Program
initiative annnounced on May 15, 1987, it said.

The EC Commission cereals management
committee rejected all bids for licences to export free market
Spanish barley to non-EC countries, trade sources said.
    The licence requests were for 35,000 tonnes at between 143
and 145 European Currency Units (ECUs), they said.
    This tender was part of a special tender for 500,000 tonnes
of Spanish barley.
    The sources said there had been no bids for licences for
free market soft wheat and non-Spanish barley exports to non-EC
countries.

Hot, dry weather has caused some
deterioration in Saskatchewan crops, according to the
Saskatchewan Wheat Pool's weekly crop report.
    Rain was needed in the southwest, west-central and
northeast regions, and other regions were expected to need rain
soon.
    Summerfallow crops were in fair to good condition, while
stubble crops were rated fair to poor. Wheat, durum, oats and
barley crops were all one-pct headed, rye was 40 pct in the
milk stage and winter wheat was 21 pct milk stage.
    Flax was 51 pct tillering, and canola was 58 pct tillering.
    Areas of the southern grain belt were hit by high winds and
hail Tuesday, with some damage reported.

Danish crops are up to two weeks
behind normal growth levels due to the cold weather in May and
June, when mean temperatures were up to four centigrade below
average, the State Plant Cultivation Bureau said in a report.
    At the season's first crop test on June 26, the bureau
rated crops at an overall 94, the same as on June 20 last year.
The figure of 100 represents normal in a year of average growth
conditions with no crop damage.
    The test gave ratings expressed as a factor of 100, as
follows - winter wheat 96 (last year 91), winter rye 97 (98),
winter barley 92 (90), spring barley 94 (98), oats 96 (98),
fodder and sugar beets 87 (96), winter rapeseed 98 (94), spring
rapeseed 94 (98).
    Final harvest figures for 1986 were not yet available.
