Reporting members of the National
Soybean Processors Association (NSPA) crushed 19,416,000
bushels of soybeans in the week ended April 8 compared with
20,115,000 bushels in the previous week and 17,160,000 in the
year-ago week, the association said.
    It said total crushing capacity for members was 25,873,904
bushels vs 25,873,904 last week and 25,459,238 bushels last
year.
    NSPA also said U.S. soybean meal exports in the week were
70,351 tonnes vs 135,452 tonnes a week ago and compared with
76,065 tonnes in the year-ago week.
    NSPA said the figures include only NSPA member firms.
    NSPA gave the following breakdown of the soybean crush for

U.S. corn sales of just over 1.0 mln
tonnes in the week ended April 2 were eight pct above the prior
week, but 25 pct below the four-week average, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    In comments on its latest Export Sales Report, the
department said Iraq, Japan and the USSR were the largest
buyers.
    Sales for the next marketing year, which begins September
1, totaled 503,200 tonnes and were mainly to Iraq and Taiwan.
    Wheat sales of 119,300 tonnes for the current season and
net reductions of 13,700 tonnes for the 1987/88 season were
four-fifths below the combined total for the prior week and the
four-week average, it said.
    Sri Lanka was the most active wheat destination with
purchases of 52,500 tonnes for the current year, it said.
    Other significant purchasers for the current year were
Mexico and Honduras, it said.
    Soybean sales of 240,500 tonnes were one-fifth below the
prior week and nearly one-third below the four-week average.
    Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Italy and Israel were the major
purchasers, the department said.
    Net sales of 117,700 tonnes of soybean cake and meal fell
31 pct from the previous week and 38 pct below the four-week
average. Major increases for West Germany, Venezuela, the
Netherlands and Saudi Arabia were partially offset by
reductions for unknown destinations, USDA said.
    Activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of 2,400
tonnes, with sales to unknown destinations down by 2,700
tonnes, while sales to Canada increased 200 tonnes, the
Department said.
    Combined sales of 71,300 running bales of cotton -- 60,200
bales for the current season and 11,100 bales for 1987/88
season -- were four-fifths higher than the prior week's level
but nine pct below the four-week average.
    Mexico was the dominant buyer for the current year followed
by Zaire, Italy, and Spain, the department said.
The primary buyers for the 1987/88 season were South Korea,
Spain, Japan and Taiwan, the department said.
    Sorghum sales of 143,300 tonnes were 25 pct less than the
prior week, with Japan and Venezuela the main buyers.

A major animal feed producer, Cehave
NV Veghel (CHV), has begun legal proceedings against the
application of the European Community grain co-responsibility
levy, with the full backing of the Dutch animal grain and feed
trade association, Het Comite, association chief executive
Peter Pex told Reuters.
    Oral proceedings were held in the Hague on Friday and the
court said it would give its verdict within six weeks. "However,
that is the normal wording and we expect the Hague court to
refer questions on the interpretation and application of the
levy to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg," Pex added.
    Het Comite claims the way the levy is applied does not take
account of currency cross-rates of exchange and can mean a
compounder in one country being asked to pay a higher levy in
its own national currency than it received down the chain from
the original producer of the grain.
    "We would like the Business Administration Court in the
Hague to ask the Luxembourg Court of Justice not only whether
the Dutch Grain Commodity Board, the levy collection agency,
has interpreted the levy regulations correctly, but also
whether the regulations themselves may contravene European law,"
Pex said.
    "It is only with great regret that we have taken this route,
but we have had no political help, and therefore have no option
even though it could take years," Pex added.
    Het Comite asked CHV to act as a test case against the
grain levy because the bill the company received from the
commodity board included grain from a wide variety of origins
and was therefore considered to be the best general basis for a
legal challenge to the levy, Pex noted.
    Het Comite's actions will run in tandem with questions on
the levy already posed to the Luxembourg Court in a case
brought by the Association of European Animal Feed
Manufacturers, FEFAC.

Graan Elevator Mij, GEM, said its
balance in port of grains, oilseeds and derivatives rose to
146,000 tonnes on April 11 from 111,000 a week earlier after
arrivals of 404,000 tonnes and discharges of 369,000 tonnes
last week.
    The balance comprised 21,000 tonnes of grains plus oilseeds
and 125,000 tonnes of derivatives.
    This week's estimated arrivals total 274,000 tonnes, of
which 71,000 are grains/oilseeds and 203,000 derivatives.
    The figures cover around 95 pct of Rotterdam traffic in the
products concerned.

Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA)
chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later this
month to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community
(EC) levy on vegetable oil imports.
    "I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is putting
up this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countries
like the Philippines," Romero said in an interview.
    He said he did not know how much support the levy had
within the EC but he said he believed those originally opposed
to the tax were under pressure to change their position.
    Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany, the
Netherlands, Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax. But
there was a danger some of them would be persuaded to change
sides, and if that happened opposition could crumble.
    Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warning
that copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained
dangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical.
    He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin per
million parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked to
apply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copra
cake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin.
    Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it
is not properly dried or ground.
    Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in
London that the Philippines was doing its best to meet EC
standards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally,
but this was likely to take several years of research.
    Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of total
coconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs.
    Romero said he would also visit Oxford University's
department of agricultural economics to discuss ways of
avoiding the copra process altogether.
    "There are ways of producing coconut products outside of
copra," Romero said. "We can process fresh coconut without drying
the meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can process
coconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go to
the chemical root."
    He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries to
become more protectionist and he expected export prices of
coconut products to drop.
    "In the long term we will be getting less and less for more
and more production, and I'm not comfortable with that," he
said.
    With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping up
production of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oil
output had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said.
    "To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spending
billions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by
saying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,"
he said.
    Romero said he expected coconut product export prices to
stay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch a
high of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents,
and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents.
    Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-year
coconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall
after two successive years of good harvests.
    He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, to
add to the production fall, drought had affected output.
    "Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought the
prices will start declining again. The only sure way to keep
prices stable is by processing, adding more value," he said.
    Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by
planting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said.
    "A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on
10,000 square metres of land. That's a lot of space," Romero
said. He said the government's proposed land reform program
would exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because they
had less than the proposed seven-hectares of land.
    "If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels,
production and employment then it won't happen," he said.
    PCA figures show about one-third of the country's
population is dependent on the coconut industry.
    Coconuts are planted on about 3.2 mln hectares or
one-fourth of total agricultural land.

Nearby months in soybean and soymeal
futures could post a short-term rally on tightening supply of
livestock feed, even if favorable growing conditions keep the
new crop outlook bearish, traders said.
    "A lot of soymeal dealers are just getting very worried
about where processors will get their soybeans this Summer,"
one Illinois soyproduct dealer said.
    Processors are competing vigorously with river dealers for
the few soybeans being offered by country elevators, with a
Decatur, Illinois processor raising its spot soybean basis bid
another two cents today to 10 over July futures.
    Farmer marketings of old crop soybeans continue very light,
with flat prices apparently well below levels they are willing
to sell, dealers said.
    Some terminal elevator operators are coming to the belief
that even if futures rally back to last month's highs, country
movement may remain light because farmers in many areas are
sold out of old crop soybeans, particularly in the eastern half
of the Midwest.
    Soybean processors will continue to take seasonal downtime
for maintenance if soybeans remain difficult to buy, reducing
the weekly soybean crush rate still further and keeping the
spot soymeal basis strong, dealers said.
    Futures traders said tight cash supplies should help July
soybeans and soymeal gain on deferreds. July soymeal has
already moved to a premium over the August through October
months and old crop July/new crop November soybeans may also
move to a July premium later this month, they added.

Japanese compound feed output rose 2.3 pct
to 25.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ended March 31 from 25.23 mln a
year earlier, the Agriculture Ministry said.
    The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand for
poultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beef
cattle raising, Ministry officials said.
    Compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87
against 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-March stocks were
217,554 tonnes against 224,101.
    Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnes
from 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.
    The officials said corn imports rose because the world
surplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reduced
Chicago prices. The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in
1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.
    Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87
from 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from
18.9 pct because of greater corn use. Higher import prices due
to poor harvests last year in major producing nations such as
Argentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.
    Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln and
the compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.
    The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted from
increased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.
    Rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against
528,152 a year earlier. The compounding ratio rose to 2.2 pct
from 2.1 pct.

The Commodity Credit Corporation
(CCC) has reallocated 1.3 mln dlrs in credit guarantees
originally granted to cover the sale of protein meals to El
Salvador so it may buy rice, the U.S. Agriculture Department

    The action reduces the guarantee line authorized for sales
of protein meals to 12.7 mln dlrs and creates a rice credit

Oilmeal demand remained strong in the
United States in July and August and six pct up on levels seen
in the same months last year, with most of the rise coming in
soymeal, the Hamburg based publication Oil World said.
    Total U.S domestic usage of the nine major oilmeals rose to
a record 19 mln tonnes in October 1986/August 1987, up 4.2 pct
on the same year-ago period, with the increase in soymeal at
seven pct, it said.
    Soviet soymeal demand rose by 310,000 tonnes in July and
330,000 tonnes in August over the respective year-ago months
following a huge increase in soymeal imports.
    Oil World presumed some imports were not used immediately
but went into stocks. With imports again large in September, it
estimated Soviet soymeal stocks sharply up at 800,000 tonnes by
October 1 from around 130,000 at the same time last year.
    EC oilmeal demand rose 100,000 tonnes in August from a year
earlier, with soymeal up 45,000 tonnes. Crushings of rapeseed,
sunseed and soybeans will probably rise from last year due to
bumper EC crops. It estimated the EC rapeseed crop at a record
5.9 mln tonnes, up from 3.7 mln last year. Rapeseed disposals
were reported at 2.1 mln tonnes by September 20 against 1.4 mln
at that time last year.
