The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.1
billion marks at today's tender for a 28-day securities
repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank
spokesman said.
    Banks, which bid for a total 12.2 billion marks liquidity,
will be credited with the funds allocated today and must buy
back securities pledged on May 6.
    Some 14.9 billion marks will drain from the market today as
an earlier pact expires, so the Bundesbank is effectively
withdrawing a net 8.1 billion marks from the market with
today's allocation.
    A Bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that the
withdrawal of funds did not reflect a tightening of credit
policy, but was to be seen in the context of plentiful
liquidity in the banking system.
    Banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the Bundesbank
over the first six days of the month, well clear of the likely
April minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks.
    The Bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12.2
billion marks, below the outgoing 14.9 billion, banks
themselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity.
    Dealers said the Bundesbank is keen to prevent too much
liquidity accruing in the market, as that would blunt the
effectiveness of the security repurchase agreement, its main
open-market instrument for steering market interest rates. Two
further pacts are likely this month over the next two weeks.
    The Bundesbank is currently steering call money between 3.6
and 3.8 pct, although short-term fluctuations outside that
range are possible, dealers said.

The Bank of England said it forecast a
shortage of around 250 mln stg in the money market today.
    Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain
some 505 mln stg, while bills for repurchase by the market will
remove around 194 mln. In addition, a rise in note circulation
and bankers' balances below target will each drain around 110
mln stg.
    Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions
will add some 690 mln stg to the system today.

Australian markets are booming as foreign
fund managers redirect capital away from the United States and
other traditional markets, analysts said.
    High short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market and
an increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of
fresh funds in the last two months, largely from Japanese and
U.S. Investors, analysts polled by Reuters said.
    Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in
and have settled on Australia, Britain and Canada as they
diversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments, they said.
    A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in
the past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for the
currency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow.
    Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital
are not available, but brokers said they received almost daily
inquiries from Japan and the United States.
    "These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about
and they don't know what to do with it. Some of that is ending
up here with the attraction of high interest rates and
reasonable currency stability," National Australia Bank Ltd
economist Brian Hamley said.
    "There is a 'flight to quality'," Hamley said. "Australia may
not be in the best (economic) position, but there aren't too
many other countries where you'd want to put your money."
    The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting
investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against
the volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said.
    "We're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S.
Where some people would be concerned about the value of the
U.S. Dollar," Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose
said. "Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap
and the currency looks stable?"
    But turning that capital into more permanent productive
investment depends on government economic policy, he said.
    "It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the
direction in the economy," Buttrose said, adding that offshore
investors would carefully watch the government's promised tough
economic statement on May 14.
    While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding
interest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as
easily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who were
badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar
and hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.
    "It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to be
delivered, if the statement wasn't considered tough enough, one
might see a substantial outflow," Buttrose said.
    Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough
economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and
stubborn current account deficit, analysts said.
    "They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think
they would like to leave the money here," Buttrose said.
    Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased
interest in investment in Australia and the need to shield
Japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.
    Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an
element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency
policy when he said authorities could not take their "eyes off
the yen" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors.
    Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked
successfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar
within the range of 100 to 103 yen.
    Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, the
Australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a
trade-weighted basis in the last three weeks.
    Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming
Australian share market. It has followed Wall Street and other
markets, but is also setting its own trend in response to the
weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into
equities, particularly in the gold sector.
    The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3
today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, while
the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the
same period.
    The property sector is also sought after, with Japanese
companies that have invested heavily in the United States in
recent years turning their attention to undervalued real
estate, particularly in the tourism field.
    Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney's five-star
Regent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs
as indicative of the type of property being sought.
    "They think they find good value real estate here which,
with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind of
investment Australia needs," Buttrose added.

Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl
said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation
of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German
economic growth.
    In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs
here, Poehl said "It would be an extremely risky policy to aim
for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to
correct the trade deficit."
    He said the United States could face a vicious circle of
depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that
route.
    Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet
U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy,
accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating
above-target money supply growth.
    He said he would have been happy to have brought forward
five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to
the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced
political constraints getting such measures through the upper
house of the West German parliament.
    But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could
accept on exports from a rising mark, he said.
    Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about
one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial
erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing
demand at home.
    "A further appreciation of the mark could even be an
obstacle to further growth," he said.
    Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply
growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and
because external factors, including low oil prices and
favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.
    But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma
over monetary policy.
    The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the
reported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germany
was affected more than before by exchange rate developments.
    "For the time being, we will have to focus our policy more
on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary
money supply. But we must be very careful," he said.
    He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan's
trade surpluses, which affected European countries as well as
the United States.
    Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary
officials of major industrialized countries, saying the
importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange
rates had been underestimated.
    All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the
right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he
said.
    "This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the
part of our American colleagues," he said.
    But he said there was still a danger that the correction of
the dollar's value could overshoot.

West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg said today's meetings of major industrial countries
would look at ways of strengthening the Paris accord on
stabilizing foreign exchange rates.
    Stoltenberg told journalists he saw no fundamental weakness
of the February 22 agreement of the Group of Five countries and
Canada to keep exchange rates near the then-current levels.
    But he declined to say what measures would be discussed
ahead of a communique of the Group of Seven ministers later
today.
    Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said
the importance of the Paris agreement, also known as the Louvre
accord, had been underestimated.
    Stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among major
countries than six months ago, at the time of the annual
meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank,
marked by sharp discord between the United States and its major
trading partners.
    "There is no fundamental weakness of the Paris accord," he
said. "We will be looking at ways of strengthening it, but I do
not want to discuss that here.
    Stoltenberg said the Louvre agreement was working despite a
"slight firming" of the yen against the dollar.
    And Poehl noted that the dollar/mark parity was unchanged
since February 22 without the Bundesbank having had to sell
marks to support the dollar.
    "The Louvre agreement has been honored by the market," he
said.
    Poehl said West Germany had lived up to its side of the
bargain in Paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to be
accelerated as a way of stimulating growth.
    Poehl said, however, that Japan had not yet fulfilled its
pledges for economic stimulation.
    "And we will have to see if the United States is able to do
what they promised in Paris on reducing the budget deficit --
and get it through Congress," he added.
    Stoltenberg reiterated West German concern about a further
fall in the dollar, noting that the mark was up 85 pct against
the dollar and nearly 20 pct on a trade-weighted basis.
    "You cannot expect that to go unnoticed in an economy. And
it is not just a German problem, it is a European problem," he
said.

Top officials of leading industrial
nations arrived at the U.S. Treasury main building to begin a

    Officials seen arriving by Reuter correspondents included
West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank
President Karl Otto Poehl, French Finance Minister Edouard

    Also seen arriving were Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi

The relatively high level of real U.S.
interest rates suggests that there is scope for further
declines in money market rates, but the Federal Reserve is
unlikely to promote such a drop as long as the dollar remains
volatile, said J.P. Morgan and Co Inc chairman Lewis Preston.
    He said in response to a reporter's question after the
bank's annual meeting that money market rates could decline
further but, "I don't think the Fed is going to encourage that
as long as the exchange markets are as volatile as they are."
    On the other hand, he said that, barring a collapse of the
dollar, he did not see rates going much higher.
    He said that Morgan's recent rise in its prime lending rate
was "purely a reflection of an increase in a whole spectrum of
rates."
    Preston reiterated earlier company forecasts that the U.S.
economy should show roughly 2.5 to three pct real growth this
year.
    He also said that as a consequence of the dollar's decline
and oil price rises, inflation would rise "moderately" to a 3.5
to four pct rate in 1987.

Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler
called on central banks of major industrialised nations to
cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies.
    In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-released
here, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was
protectionism and control on capital movements.
    "Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market
transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have
them," he said. He added that West German growth forecasts would
have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop
to 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.
    Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets
had parted company with transactions in goods, services and
investments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that
determined market trends.
    Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to
grow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates
would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.
    "In other words, the monetary policy measures required are
different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --
those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of
mounting economic activity," Koehler said.
    The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.
Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation
going by talking the dollar down posed problems.
    The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep
rise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost
of European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports
to the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to
make itself felt compared with the price effect.
    "Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going
further than would be necessary to adjust the current account
over the medium term," Koehler said.
    A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur
only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.
In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should
rise faster than GNP.
    "In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986," Koehler said.
    If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be
prevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by
an inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..
    But only if there was an appropriate interest rate
differential would Europe and Japan look for financial
investment in the U.S.
    When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank
had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its
measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.
    Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates
by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading
interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market
and its substantial impact on exchange rates.
    It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of
price stability, economic growth and full employment but also
to tackle international problems like the exchange rate
problem, the debt problem and the current account problem.
    A strategy had to be designed that helped "the safeguarding
of non-inflationary economic growth in an international
monetary system largely free of disruptions," Koehler said.
    Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was
necessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed
to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over
the next few years and intervention points should not be set,
because they were only testing points for the market, he said.
    In order to keep the international monetary system free of
disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but
also cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.

Following is the text of a statement
by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France,
Britain, Italy and Canada -- issued after a Washington meeting
yesterday.
    1. The finance ministers and central bank governors of
seven major industrial countries met today.
    They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of
their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened
economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of
their heads of state or government.
    The managing director of the International Monetary Fund
also participated in the meeting.
    2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to
the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting,
and noted the progress achieved in implementing the
undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement.
    They agreed, however, that further actions will be
essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain
global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances.
    In this connection they welcomed the proposals just
announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan
for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan's
economy through early implementation of a large supplementary
budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as
unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.
    The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further
open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services.
    3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that
around current levels their currencies are within ranges
broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic
policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.
    In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation
of the Louvre Agreement.
    They concluded that present and prospective progress in
implementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in this
statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to
foster the stability of exchange rates.

European currency markets reacted quietly
to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers
ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to
surprise that the markets should have expected so much.
    The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies
and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which
reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency
stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.
    Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining
broadly entrenched in its current trading range.
    "The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84
marks," said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank
AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.
    However, she said the dollar could break out of the range
with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.
Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.
    Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd
in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against
the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,
possibly to 140 yen.
    A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects
a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.
    London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb
underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative
sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank
operators to test the downside.
    Concern that finance ministers and officials still in
Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of
currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with
worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the
near term, the traders said.
    Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the
communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's
downward trend.
    Traders in several centres said the market would look for
fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to
defend current ranges, which the communique said were "broadly
consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy
intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."
    Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said
"They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon." The
U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.
    However, some dealers said London-based operators would be
unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long
Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825
marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.
    Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said
the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable
market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme
volatility seen in the first few months of this year.
    One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the
communique made clear the leading nations did not want a
further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.
    The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to
1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre
accord's supposed currency target range.
    A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were
ready for a period of "mainly sideways movement."
    But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique
contributing to greater stability.
    "Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big
boost," said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he
expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks
in the next three months.
    A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, said
the communique had been in line with realistic expectations and
should not have produced disappointment.
    "The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and trade
policies to redress current imbalances are of a different
timescale than currency markets operate on," the source told
Reuters, "This is a political process which takes time."
    Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp in
Basle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident on
currency markets today. "Did people really expect a patent
remedy?" he asked.
    Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday's meeting was only
the first in a series and said the market would watch carefully
in the next few weeks for any changes in positions.
    A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus was
now on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move by
Japan and West Germany to boost their economic growth could
lead to a quick change in the U.S. Position.
    Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary in
pushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming months
while central banks appear resolved to use their muscle to
support the Paris accord.

Remarks by central bankers raised some
hopes the Bundesbank will cut rates on securities repurchase
pacts, but operators remained divided on the likelihood of a
move in the near term, money market dealers said.
    Comments by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler yesterday
that rate cuts were needed to curb money supply growth from
speculative capital inflows, and by West Berlin state central
bank president Dieter Hiss that there was no natural lower
limit to the discount rate had, however, no immediate impact.
    Call money declined to 3.65/75 pct from 3.75/85 pct but the
drop was tied to extra liquidity in the market, dealers said.
    Dealers said the Bundesbank's latest liquidity allotment
this week dashed some hopes of lower rates.
    The Bundesbank allotted only 6.1 billion marks yesterday in
new liquidity in a repurchase pact at an unchanged rate of 3.80
pct, thus subtracting some 8.8 billion marks from the market,
as an outgoing 14.9 billion pact expired.
    But some dealers said the smaller volume awarded by the
pact was in line with present liquid money market conditions,
and did not exlude a cut in the repurchase pact rate soon to
3.70 pct if money market rates continue at present levels.
    The next opportunity for the Bundesbank to lower rates on
repurchase pacts will be in a tender expected next Tuesday.
    Bundesbank officials have already said they favour more
discreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts, rather than
the more public adjustment of leading rates.
    The Bundesbank may either set a fixed allocation rate and
allow banks to tender for the volume, as has been the case
since it lowered its discount rate January 22, or else it may
allow banks to tender for the rate and set the volume itself.
    Dealers expect volume of the tender to be lower than the
15.2 billion marks flowing out, to offset other incoming funds.
    Some seven billion marks is expected to flow in next week.
This should then flow back into the market as it is deposited

    Banks were well supplied with liquidity, holding 61.5
billion marks in reserves at the Bundesbank on Tuesday.
    Holdings of average daily reserves over the first seven

European currency markets reacted quietly
to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers
ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to
surprise that the markets should have expected so much.
    The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies
and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which
reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency
stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.
    Frankfurt and Zurich dealers saw the dollar staying broadly
entrenched in its current trading range.

Finance ministers from seven major
industrialized nations agreed on the need to stabilize
currencies at current levels but said more action was needed to
reduce trade imbalances and sustain economic growth.
    In a communique issued after a four-hour meeting at the
U.S. Treasury that ended last night, the ministers said the
value of the dollar and other currencies was basically correct
now, and they welcomed new measures planned by the Japanese to
boost their economy.
    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg called it
a "good meeting" and in brief remarks exchanged with reporters
other ministers seemed pleased with its outcome.
    Shortly after the communique was issued and just as foreign
exchange trading opened in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan intervened
again to prevent the yen rising too quickly.
    The communique said, "The ministers and governors reaffirmed
the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent
Paris meeting. They agreed, however, that further actions will
be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain
global economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances."
    It welcomed the plans set this week by the Japan's ruling
Liberal Democratic Party to stimulate its economy with what the
communique termed "extraordinary and urgent measures" including
an "unprecedented front-end loading of public works
expenditures."
    The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven brought
together ministers and central bank governors of the seven
major industrial democracies, the United States, Japan, West
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
    The communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitment
on cooperation reached in a meeting on February 22 in Paris
when they had agreed to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the
then-current levels.
    In the weeks that followed, the dollar continued to fall
against the Japanese yen despite massive dollar purchases by
the Bank of Japan and other central banks and is now trading at
around postwar lows.
    Japan has come under growing criticism from both the United
States and European countries for its only modest efforts to
open its markets to outside competition and to reduce its
exports.
    The communique said Japan affirmed its intention to open
domestic markets to foreign goods and services but did not
elaborate.
    It said the officials "reaffirmed the view that around
current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly
consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy
intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."

Following is the text of a statement
by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France,
Britain, Italy and Canada -- issued after a Washington meeting
yesterday.
    1. The finance ministers and central bank governors of
seven major industrial countries met today.
    They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of
their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened
economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of
their heads of state or government.
    The managing director of the International Monetary Fund
also participated in the meeting.
    2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to
the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting,
and noted the progress achieved in implementing the
undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement.
    They agreed, however, that further actions will be
essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain
global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances.
    In this connection they welcomed the proposals just
announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan
for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan's
economy through early implementation of a large supplementary
budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as
unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.
    The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further
open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services.
    3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that
around current levels their currencies are within ranges
broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic
policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.
    In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation
of the Louvre Agreement.
    They concluded that present and prospective progress in
implementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in this
statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to
foster the stability of exchange rates.

Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) countries reaffirmed
their Paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince the
market of their resolve.
    At a news conference after today's G-7 meeting, Miyazawa
said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a
totally new statement was needed.
    The speculative selling did not reflect economic
fundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only a
reaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, he
said.
    He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve had
concentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially the
mark, had remained stable.
    Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since the
Paris accord was not worth being called fundamental.
    "As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement), the expression
of 'current level' is rather vague idea," he said.
    The yen's movement in the past several weeks is within the
range agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said.
    It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointing
a level, which could have an adverse impact on the market,
Miyazawa said.
    Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in the
statement, he said Japan was exceptional among the seven
because the yen appreciated against the dollar while other
major currencies largely have been stable.
    He also said Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has
justed adoped a package to reflate the economy while other
nations are not supposed to produce new measures in a short
period since the Paris agreement.
    Miyazawa also said the U.S. sanctions against Japanese
semiconductor products was not discussed through the G-7
meeting and did not affect the currency talks.
    The seven nations discussed the debt problems of developing
countries and ways to proceed in line with the debt initiative
outlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker 18 months ago.

European currency markets reacted quietly
to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers
ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to
surprise that the markets should have expected so much.
    The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies
and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which
reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency
stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.
    Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining
broadly entrenched in its current trading range.
    "The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84
marks," said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank
AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.
    However, she said the dollar could break out of the range
with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.
Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.
    Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd
in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against
the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,
possibly to 140 yen.
    A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects
a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.
    London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb
underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative
sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank
operators to test the downside.
    Concern that finance ministers and officials still in
Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of
currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with
worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the
long term, the traders said.
    Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the
communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's
downward trend.
    Traders in several centres said the market would look for
fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to
defend current ranges, which the communique said were "broadly
consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy
intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."
    Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said
"They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon." The
U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.
    However, some dealers said London-based operators would be
unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long
Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825
marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.
    Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said
the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable
market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme
volatility seen in the first few months of this year.
    One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the
communique made clear the leading nations did not want a
further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.
    The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to
1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre
accord's supposed currency target range.
    A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were
ready for a period of "mainly sideways movement."
    But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique
contributing to greater stability.
    "Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big
boost," said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he
expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks
in the next three months.

The Lebanese Pound fell sharply against

    "Political deadlock is reflected in the pound's position.

The Bundesbank sees no current reason
to change monetary course, vice-president Helmut Schlesinger
told Reuters in a telephone interview.
    Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks
yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West
Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which, dealers
said, revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts
may once again be under discussion.
    Schlesinger said he had no comment on the remarks of his
two central bank council colleagues.
    But he added that the last central bank council meeting on
April 2 had discussed the economic situation with a mood of
"subdued optimism," particularly influenced by the news brought
by several state central bank presidents.
    "Much is going better than the impression gained by the
public from the January figures, which have been in the
meantime superseded," he said.
    German January industrial output fell 3.0 pct after a
decline of 0.9 pct in December. New industry orders fell 1.9
pct after they had been unchanged in December.
    Bank economists said that the two together showed the
economy would either stagnate or contract in the first quarter
of 1987.
    Aside from the economic developments, Schlesinger added, a
steady monetary course was important to hold the dollar/mark
rate around current levels as Bundesbank president Karl Otto
Poehl had said while attending the Washington World Bank/IMF
meeting.
    Asked, however, if the Bundesbank could move to cut rates
on repurchase agreements at the setting of the next repurchase
tender, due next Tuesday, Schlesinger said, "Since the central
bank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14
days, this is hardly probable."
    Responding to the question whether the Bundesbank had moved
away from a policy of targetting monetary growth toward one of
targetting currency rates, Schlesinger said he could have no
comment on the subject while negotiations were still in
progress in Washington.

The Federal Reserve may intervene in
the government securities market to supply temporary reserves
indirectly via customer repurchase agreements, economists said.
    They said that while the Fed faces no great urgency to add
reserves at the start of the two-week maintenance period today
it would probably do so in order to offset a relatively high
federal funds rate.
    Fed funds opened at 6-3/16 pct and remained there in early
trading. Yesterday, they averaged 6.45 pct, after rising as
high as seven pct at the close.

The Group of 10 developed nations

accord on currency stability by the Group of Seven leading
industrial democracies yesterday.
    In the communique issued this morning, the G-10 said
"prospects of member countries' economies would be improved by
stability in the exchange rates of their currencies."
    The G-10 includes the group of seven - the United States,
Canada, Britain, Japan, Italy, West Germany and France - plus
Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and also Switzerland.
    Sources who attended the G-10 conference this morning said
the reference to the latest G-7 agreement was especially added

all the G-10 members.
    The G-10 met briefly before the International Monetary Fund

The dollar drifted down to end one
pfennig lower after a lacklustre session, held in limits by the
lack of concrete news from the Group of Seven meeting and
comments on the edge of the Washington IMF/World Bank meeting.
    Dealers said the communique early in the European morning
from the G-7 meeting contained no significant new factors and
although the dollar dipped it generally resisted further
attempts to push it lower through the day.
    The U.S. Currency ended at 1.8270/80 marks, below
yesterday's last 1.8365/75.
    Koch said the assessment of the dollar's direction was
based on a global view, with operators paying most attention to
comments by finance officials to see how closely they stated
adherence to international agreements such as those set at the
Plaza Hotel in 1985 and in Paris on February 22.
    Koch described the wording of the communique from the G-7
as "soft as wax."
    Bundebank vice-president Helmut Schlesinger told Reuters in
a telephone interview that the German central bank sees no
current reason to change monetary course at present.
    Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks
yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West
Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which dealers
said revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts
may be under consideration.
    German call money was slightly softer today, at around 3.70
pct after 3.80 yesterday.
    Some dealers said rates on new liquidity injections added
via Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements may be cut next
week. Hopes of a cut were dashed on Tuesday with an allocation
at an unchanged 3.80 pct.
    But speaking of the pact tender rate next week, Schlesinger
said, "since the central bank council gives its opinion on this
theme only every 14 days, this is hardly probable."
    Euromark rates scarcely responded to the central bankers
comments, with six months funds ending unaltered at around
3-7/8 pct. Eurodollars for the same maturity rose a fractional
1/16 pct from yesterday to around 6-11/16 pct.
    Sterling dipped to end at 2.952/956 marks after 2.960/965
last night. The Swiss franc firmed slightly to 120.30/45 marks
per 100 from 120.25/40, with the yen soaring however to
1.2570/90 marks per 100 from 1.2515/35 yesterday.
    EMS currencies saw the French franc end unchanged from last
night at 30.03/06 marks per 100, with the Belgian franc easing
however to 4.829/831 marks per 100 from 4.831/833.

Treasury Secretary James Baker said
that changes in exchange rates have generally been orderly and
have improved the prospects for a reduction in external
imbalances to more sustainable levels.
    In remarks before the IMF's policy-making Interim
Committee, Baker reiterated a Group of Seven statement last
night that the substantial exchange rate changes since the
Plaza agreement 18 months ago have "now brought currencies
within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals."
    Baker said, "These exchange rate shifts have generally been
orderly, and have improved prospects for the reduction of
external imbalances to more sustainable levels."
    As they are today, the trade and current account imbalances
"simply are not sustainable," Baker told the ministers.
    He said that the Reagan administration was resisting "strong
domestic pressure" for trade protection and was working closely
with the U.S. Congress in crafting a trade bill.
    "While we cannot yet be sure of the outcome, we are doing
what we can to ensure that the bill is not protectionist," he
said.
    Baker also urged the International Monetary Fund's
executive board to review possible modifications to the Fund's
compensatory financing facility before the annual meeting this
fall.
    "We should pay particular attention to the lack of
continuing conditionality associated with the use of the CFF
and to whether shortfalls in export earnings are indeed
temporary," he said.

Treasury Secretary James Baker said
the floating exchange rate system has not been as effective as
had been hoped in promoting stability and preventing imbalances
from emerging in the global economy.
    In remarks before the afternoon session of the
International Monetary Fund's Interim Committee, Baker said he
was not suggesting that the system should be abandoned.
    "But I do suggest," he said, "that we need something to give
it more stability and to keep it headed in the right direction
when the wind shifts."
    He said that indicators can serve "as a kind of compass" but
added that structural indicators can help focus attention on
some policies.
    Baker, however, said the IMF "needs to move beyond
macroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators that
can help focus attention on some of the policies of specific
relevance to the imbalances we face today."
    The Treasury Secretary said that indicators should be given
a more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- Article
IV consultations -- that the Fund performs.
    Baker also told the policy making group that it was time
for the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMF
surveillance more relevant to national policymakers and the
public.
    "In particular, we urge increased publicity for IMF
appraisals developed in Article IV consultations, the use of
follow-up reports on country actions to implement IMF
recommendations, and greater use of special consultation
procedures," he said.
    Baker emphasized that indicators were a device "for moving
beyond rhetoric to action."
    He said they provide "more structure to the system, and
induce more discipline and peer pressure into the process of
policy coordination."
    He said the Fund's procedures for surveillance need to be
reviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators.
    "This should be matter of priority for the executive board,"
he said.
    Baker also urged the Fund to develop alternative
medium-term economic scenarios for countries that "can help us
focus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, by
identifying options for addressing them and analyzing the
implications of these options."
    He said also that further work should be done on finding
paths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives.
    "If we are to take effective remedial action when there are
significant deviations from an intended course, then we must
have more definitive ways of indentifying the right course for
key variables," he said.

Commodities from gold to grains to
cotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as losses
in the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears of
inflation and economic instability.
    Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in New
York, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs a
troy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.
    A key factor behind the advance was anticipation that
inflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations
to halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said Steve
Chronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,
Harris Upham and Co., in New York.
    The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from
the seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their
commitment to support its value, and despite reports of
intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.
    Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, known
as the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-term
direction of the currency markets.
    "Maybe they have some ideas or plans," said Chronowitz. "If
they do, it's not evident."
    "It looks like there's no cure but to let the free market
take values to where they should be.
    "One way or another, we will force our major trading
partners to stimulate their economies," as a measure to correct
the mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said.
    "I think the markets believe, and have believed for a long
time, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It's
going to be a long and tedious process, but that's what's
happening," he said.
    The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commodities
cheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.
    At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bonds
saw the value of their investments falling and many are turning
to commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said Marty
McNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house of
Dominick and Dominick.
    The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout
the commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cotton
posted broad gains.
    Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in the
grain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome
supplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulate
export demand.
    After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department
raised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union by
two mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.
    Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderately
higher.
    Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They said
hogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal at
this time of year, and farmers have been too busy with field
work to market animals.

Economists said that they doubt the
Federal Reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar, despite
higher discount window borrowings in the latest two-week
statement period and very heavy borrowings Wednesday.
    Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged
393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday, up from 265 mln
dlrs in the prior statement period. Wednesday borrowings were
1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.
    "One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but it
probably isn't," said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds.
    Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policy
modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the
two-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging
around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.
    However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latest
two-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand
often pushes up borrrowings.
    "Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but it
looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions
late in the statement period and didn't quite make it," said
Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
    A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today that
the Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs or
more in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday.
    Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in
its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer
reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.
    The Fed took no market reserve management action last
Thursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It added
temporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of
customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves
directly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday.
    Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that the
two-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on
Tuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday's
overnight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.
    "It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy at
this time," said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.
    Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzi
said the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest
rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak
economies in the United States and abroad and add to the
financial stress of developing countries and their lenders.
    "Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the latest
statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar
tumbled," said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.
    He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new
statement period began today on disappointment yesterday's
Washington meetings of international monetary officials failed
to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.
    In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing in
Wednesday's G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that
the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade
imbalance between the United States and Japan.
    The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming for
steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average
Fed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about where
the rate has been since early November.
    "I'm not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighter
policy to help the dollar, as some suspect," said Sullivan of
Dean Witter.
    If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has just
nudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct from
six to 6.10 pct previously.

Today's turmoil in the U.S. Financial
markets, with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar's
wake, is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology that
is likely to spell more turbulence ahead, economists said.
    For two years, the markets had hailed the dollar's decline
as the cure-all for the U.S. Trade deficit. Interest rates fell
sharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up.
    But that confidence is now cracking as the financial
markets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker's
often-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.
    "Volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollar
freefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it," said
David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.
    The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in
40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington
failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a
credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, short
of further depreciation of the dollar.
    Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid
worries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scare
away foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit.
    The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12
dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spike
in interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down
by 33 points to 2339.
    Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called the
markets' instability frightening. He believes economic
fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that "once
you start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop."
    "There's a stark possibility that you could get a
destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates
and drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic."
    Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics
in Washington, has been warning for a long time that the
controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and
264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.
    "We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... But
the agony may be fairly drawn out," Marris told Reuters.
    Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this
year, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it
would take very little to touch off what he calls the second
phase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in the
dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.
    The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop on
March 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.
    The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with
historical experience, which teaches that domestic markets are
not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its
decline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.
    Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latest
weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks
suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling
below 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set as
part of the G-7 Paris agreement in February.
    Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss of
confidence was triggered last week when Washington announced
plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic
imports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.
    Many economists believe that long-run stability will not
return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is
addressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in the
massive budget deficit.
    But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and of
central bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have no
choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.
    "The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a
substantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding
cut abroad, at least by Japan," said Lanston's Jones.
    Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest
rates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for
American farmers, Latin American governments and others.
    But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs and
Co, scoffed at the notion. "It's ridiculous to think the Federal
Reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak
against just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollar
weakness," he said.
    Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being
made toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit.
    "We're going to have one of the biggest reductions in the
budget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobody
cares," he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69
will have been greater.
    He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and
thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year.
    But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly that
a further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. "Put on
your helmets," Giordano said.

Japanese trade figures are seriously
challenging the entrenched view of policy makers of the Group
of Seven industrialised nations that relative currency rates
are the key to smoothing world trade problems.
    Senior Japanese, U.S. And European officials in Tokyo say
they are at a loss to fully explain the data, for if currencies
are the key they ask, why then are are U.S. Exports to Japan
shrinking?
    What if manipulating currencies and driving the dollar down
made world trade problems worse rather than solving them,
fulfilling Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's forecast of
world trade recession?
    U.S.-Japan trade has declined even after a 40 pct dollar
fall against the yen since the September 1985 Group of Five
pact in New York.
    The lower dollar ought to have made U.S. Exports 40 pct
more competitive in Japan. The officials, most of them
economists, can offer no objective reason why they are not.
    Worse, how are European Community sales to Japan rising
rapidly when the European Currency Unit has until now declined
only 11 pct against the yen.?
    Last week's G-7 meeting in Washington has been widely
interpreted as a sign from the policy makers that the dollar
must go lower. So worst of all, what if Volcker is correct?
    At a loss to give an objective explanation, officials can
only offer explanations which tend to be highly subjective.
    "I don't know and I don't think anyone knows," said Hugh
Richardson, acting head of the EC delegation in Tokyo.
    "What I do know is that Community exporters are making a
hell of an effort in this market. If you make an effort, there
is money to be made in Japan," he added.
    But U.S. Officials and businessmen are convinced low U.S.
Exports to Japan are Japan's fault. They cite restrictive trade
practices, protected Japanese trade sectors, such as
agriculture, and non-tariff barriers, such as unreasonable
checking and customs procedures for car imports.
    Publicly, Japanese officials remain conciliatory in the
face of what they see as U.S. Aggression. In private, they
blame U.S. Industry for being uncompetitive.
    "We see it that way, but we don't like to seem arrogant,"
said a senior official, who declined to be named. "We like to
refrain from accusing them of not making enough effort."
    Industrialists such as Eishiro Saito, chairman of the
Keidanren business group, and Sony Corp chairman Akio Morita
repeatedly accuse foreign firms of not making enough effort to
understand Japan's markets, and some foreigners agree. "The real
issue is the inability of major sectors of American and
European industry to compete not only internationally but even
in their home markets," Peter Huggler, President of Interallianz
Bank Zurich, told a recent conference in Switzerland.

Major U.S. banks may lift prime
lending rates again within days due to recent increases in
their borrowing costs and speculation the Federal Reserve is
nudging up interest rates to help the dollar, economists said.
    In what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984, most
banks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to
7-3/4 pct, citing a reduced gap between the prime and their own
cost of money. That spread has narrowed again.
    "A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,"
said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc.
    Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct is
justified because the spread between banks' cost of funds and
the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a
percentage point.
    He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentage
points since last October until it fell below one point and
triggered the April prime rate rise at most banks.
    "We could easily have another prime rate increase as soon
as this week," said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.
    "We've got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the
near future," said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.
    "Based on the spread between the prime rate and funding
costs, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,"
said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank.
    However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime
because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan
demand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintain
recent upward pressure on money market interest rates.
    Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures lift
short-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. He
said "if there is widespread belief money market rates will
stay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time."
    Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a
dollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollar
fell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traders
said the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar.
    In addition to buying dollars outright, another way to
stabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S.
interest rates higher relative to overseas rates.
    Based particularly on the Fed's reserve management actions
on Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said "it has become
clear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure
in the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed."
    Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interest
rates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculation
that the Fed is gently firming monetary policy.
    That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in the
market than most economists had expected.
    On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in small
amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements
with the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another
high at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pct
today, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlr
round of customer repurchase agreements.
    "The Fed's actions on Friday and today show that it is
offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,"
said Jones of Lanston.
    "The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the
need to defend the dollar," Jones said. He believes it is
merely shading policy toward restraint now, "but to have a
major impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policy
overtly at some point."
    Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by
becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, within
four to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct.
    Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct might
well be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to
further aid the dollar.
    Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on
30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime rate
may be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year's end.
    "The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening
policy to defend the dollar," said Leslie of Discount Corp. He
said tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately.
Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressures
abate will show whether or not it is firming policy.

A cut of about half a percentage point
in Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect, although
economists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves.
    Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank,
encouraged by a strong guilder/mark relationship and wide
premiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German,
might lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first.
    Last month, the Central Bank lowered its special advances
rate to 5.1 pct from 5.25 pct after the Bundesbank dropped its
repurchase tender rate to 3.55 pct from 3.8 pct.
    That rate has remained in force, just holding above the
five pct official secured loans rate which governs commercial
bank borrowings.
    Given a strong guilder, a further fall in the West German
repo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff,
forcing an official Dutch rate cut, analysts said.
    In February, when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate to
three pct from 3.5 pct, the Central Bank only lowered money
market rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loans
rate on lending under its three month credit quota.
    Since then, however, both the Central Bank and Finance
Ministry have made it clear they favour lower official rates.
    In April, Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said he
would follow any Bundesbank cut, and last week the Finance
Ministry expressed satisfaction when it raised 2.25 billion
guilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 100.10 pct
for an effective yield of 5.98 pct, the lowest since 1965.
    Technically, analysts said, there has to be a difference
between the secured loans rate which applies to lending under
the credit quota, and the tariff on special advances which add
extra liquidity to the money market.
    Bank economists and dealers said a West German move to
further lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts would
result in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate,
provided the guilder/mark relationship permitted.
    The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around its
parity value within the European Monetary System of 112.673
guilders per 100 marks.
    Today, foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10
guilder cents to 112.705 guilders per 100 at the fix, a level
that would not permit a change in the interest rate
differential between West Germany and the Netherlands, dealers
said.
    An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German and
Dutch interest rates to ease in the short term. However, he
said new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation
expectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates
in the longer term.
    In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil,
or even negative, while the latest official economic forecasts
point to a falling rate of economic growth.
    "It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement
negotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,"
the ABN economist said.
    He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct in
January, could also contribute to some inflation.
    At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run to
two pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates,
currently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in the
second half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct.
    Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying
spree on the bond market which would bring yields down,
probably only temporarily, while money rates could fall below
five pct.
    Currently, all periods are traded at 5.12 to 5.25 pct in
the money market.

President Reagan, preparing to depart
for the Venice economic summit on Wednesday, said the United
States and its allies must fulfill agreements on exchange rate
stability.
    "Economic policy decisions made last year in Tokyo, and at
this year's meetings of Group of 7 Finance ministers in Paris
and in Washington, cannot be ignored or forgotten," he said.
    "The commitments made at these meetings need to be
translated into action," Reagan said in a pre-summit speech
celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Marshall Plan.

The dollar's recent signs of stability
have raised hopes that its 27-month decline may be nearly over,
but most currency analysts refuse to commit themselves until
after the June 12 release of U.S. trade data for April.
    "The trade data will be a deciding factor to see if the
dollar has bottomed out," said Jim McGroarty of Discount Corp.
    Since February 1985, the dollar has nearly halved its value
against the yen and the mark as part of an officially
orchestrated campaign to make U.S. goods more competitive on
world markets and redress gaping world trade imbalances.
    On April 27, the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 137.25 yen
but has enjoyed a modest recovery over the last few weeks,
topping 145 yen today for the first time in nearly two months.
    Many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen far
enough to ease the trade deficit's drag on the U.S. economy.
    The U.S. trade gap narrowed to 13.6 billion dlrs in March
from 15.1 billion in February and is expected to show continued
improvement in April in volume, if not in real, terms.
    Keiichi Udagawa of Bank of Tokyo in New York said that if
further progress is reported, the dollar would head back up
towards 150 yen.
    "There is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomed
out for the medium term," added Tom Campbell of First National
Bank of Chicago.
    Other factors supporting this bullish view were growing
expectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker would
be reappointed for a third four-year term in August, Japan's
larger-than-expected economic stimulus package last week and 
more favorably technical chart signals, analysts said.
    The dollar was also aided by Japan's moves to dampen
speculative selling in Tokyo and by reports of active central
bank intervention to support the dollar.
    The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last week that
the U.S. monetary authorities bought more than four billion
dlrs during the February-April period -- the largest amount
since the dollar crisis of the late 1970's.
    Discount Corp's McGroarty described the Fed's intervention
volume as "impressive".
    James O'Neill of Marine Midland Bank was not so positive,
however: "the dollar has not yet bottomed out. After the trade
data are released, the dollar could fall towards 1.77 marks and
140 yen."
    Similarly, Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank in New York
warned, "I don't think the dollar has bottomed out yet."
    Although the dollar could rise as high as 146.50 yen, Okada
said market impatience about the painstakingly slow decline of
the U.S. trade deficit may lead to renewed pressure.
    Currency analysts also warned about an unfavorable reaction
to the seven-nation economic Summit on June 8 to 10 in Venice,
which is likely to focus on the implementation of previous
commitments rather than yield any fresh initiatives.
    President Reagan said today, "economic policy decisions
made last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group of
Seven finance ministers in Paris and Washington cannot be
ignored or forgotten."
    "The commitments made at these meetings need to be
translated into action," he added in a speech, celebrating the
40th anniversary of the Marshall aid plan for Europe.
    Now that Tokyo has unveiled its fiscal stimulus package,
analysts expected Bonn and the dollar/mark rate to bear the
brunt of U.S. calls for further action.
    Marine Midland's O'Neill said, "pressure will build up on
Germany to take stimulative action like Japan."
    Some Japanese bank dealers warned that although the dollar
could hold above 145 yen for some months it could also come
under attack again if it seems the latest economic package is
not having much impact on Japan's economy and its trade
surplus. Reflecting a longer-term uncertainty, some some trust
banks and Japanese insurers are keeping their short dollar
positons hedged against exchange losses in their foreign
portfolios, while some others have started covering those short
positions, Japanese bank dealers said.

Venezuela's central bank has ordered
Venezuelan banks and exchange houses to cease foreign exchange
operations with brokers based outside the country, according to
a copy of a central bank telex made available to Reuters.
    The measure, confirmed by a brokerage firm here, has
effectively cut off all foreign participation in Venezuela's
volatile currency market.
    The telex, issued on May 19, was signed by Carlos Hernandez
Delfino, manager of the bank's department of international
operations.
    The telex said the restriction on business with foreign
brokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreign
exchange houses from selling dollars or other foreign
currencies to anyone living outside Venezuela.
    In recent weeks the Venezuelan government has denied
rumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls to
prop up the weakening bolivar.
    But brokers said the central bank's move is seen as a de
facto currency control. "It is definitely a control in the sense
that there's no longer complete freedom to operate," one broker
here said.
    "Gradually they're imposing restrictions and the direction
is towards complete control," the broker said.
    The broker, who requested anonymity, said virtually all his
Venezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him since
the central bank issued the telex and followed it up with
telephone calls.
    He said that before the restriction was imposed the volume
of his firm's transactions with Venezuela was about 10 mln dlrs
a day. "It was a frenetic market, it was really quite active," he
said.
    The broker said he saw no logical explanation for the
prohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediary
between Venezuelan brokers, exchange houses and banks.
    "We weren't buying dollars from Venezuelans, that's
ridiculous," he said. "They've been on a rampage against
foreigners."
    The broker noted that two months ago Venezuela's central
bank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchange
business outside Venezuela would have to respect a new 200 pct
reserve requirement.
    In February, the central bank also prohibited trading in
bolivar futures, the broker said.
    "We used to have a forward market," he said. "For a small
currency it was miraculous."
    He said the bolivar, which averaged 20.29 to the U.S.
Dollar in 1986, would continue to slip from its current range
of 28.35 to 28.50 because the central bank was rapidly running
out of foreign reserves to support the currency on the free
market.

For currency dealers Karl Otto Poehl is
the scourge of speculators, for bankers he is the man who has
played a key role in shaping the world's financial destiny for
the last seven years, and for Germans he is the guardian of the
mark.
    President of the powerful and independent West German
central bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have his
contract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the
end of this year, government officials say.
    (Index of economic spotlights, see page ECRA)
    But no official announcement has yet been made, raising
eyebrows in West Germany's business community.
    The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in top
ministerial posts under the Social Democrats, now in
opposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank.
    There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohl
would try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his own
Christian Democrats. But officials noted that Poehl has worked
closely and successfully with Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982.
    Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from Paul
Volcker of the United States, enjoys a strong international
reputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up.
    Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlook
Poehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat Chancellor
Willy Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he was
Finance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, as
Chancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980.
    In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against the
dollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of
the Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institution
which has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent
inflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two bouts
of galloping inflation this century.
    But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and
inflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safe
to relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the
dangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate.
    "I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the
dollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the
Bundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark
would endanger the economy in West Germany," he told business
journalists in Frankfurt recently.
    Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says that
Poehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.
    "Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does not
focus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external
economy," she said.
    An economist at a German bank, who declined to be
identified, said "If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it will
certainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so
rigidly oriented towards money supply."
    One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been to
persuade the United States to stop "talking down" the dollar. For
Poehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that
the United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise
currencies.
    The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency
dealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But in
fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact.
    "This is because the markets know - or perhaps because they
don't know - what the central banks can do," Poehl says of
intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates
round, making a speculator's position worthless.
    Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist
in the 1960s before starting his ministerial career.
    A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over
a glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker.
    He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and
play golf.
    Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute
for correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced.
    "But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount
if you strike at the right moment," he said. Bundesbank dealers
are very professional and skilled. "They've burnt the fingers of
many people," he said. And unlike the speculators, Poehl notes,
the Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit.

Taiwan's central bank announced that as
from today the overseas foreign exchange borrowings of local
and foreign banks would be frozen at the level they reached at
the end of May.
    The central bank's statement added that the measure would
be effective until the end of July.
    Bankers said the measure is designed to curb the inflow of
foreign exchange and slow the growth of money supply. They
added that the move, which sparked a record single day plunge
of the local stock market, would limit their ability to lend
foreign exchange to importers and exporters.
    Foreign exchange borrowings by local and foreign banks
reached almost 12 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of April,
according to official statistics.
    Last week the central bank said that from today it would
reduce its purchase of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40
pct from 90 pct of the value of the contract. It said the move
was needed because of "distortions" in the foreign exchange
market.
    Exporters, nervous about the appreciating Taiwan dollar,
have been heavily selling forward U.S. Dollars on the interbank
market to avoid exchange rate losses.
    Official figures show that forward U.S. Dollar sales in May
reached a record of almost six billion U.S. Dlrs against 5.9
billion in April.
    All Taiwan's foreign exchange earnings must be converted
into local dollars, boosting money supply at a time of booming
exports. Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.86 pct in
the year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation.
    In March the central bank clamped tight restrictions on
remittances of foreign exchange by companies and individuals to
Taiwan in a move to curb inflows of speculative money.
    Economists and bankers estimate that the rising value of
the local dollar has attracted about ten billion U.S. Dlrs of
speculative money into Taiwan since early last year. It has
flowed in mainly from Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S..
    Since September 1985 the Taiwan dollar has risen by about
22 pct against the U.S. Dollar.
    Bankers said the government's efforts to stabilise the
foreign exchange market were a prelude to lifting all curbs on
capital outflows. The central bank has said the controls will
be dropped by the end of July or early August.
    Foreign exchange dealers said today's announcement caused
jitters in the market with foreign and local banks making heavy
purchases of U.S. Dollars. They said the central bank sold
about 30 mln U.S. Dlrs.
    Taiwan's stock market plunged a record 75.53 points to
close at 1,803.08.

Interest rates on Kuwaiti dinar deposits
held firm in scattered trading despite a Central Bank decision
to revive limited funding lines, dealers said.
    The Central Bank, which last Tuesday shut a daily aid
window through which it lent funds of up to one year, reopened
the facility for three month money, which was available at
seven pct, they said.
    It offered one month funds at seven pct through swap
facilities, dealers said.
    Today's Central Bank action, combined with sales of dollars
by some banks, helped ease a recent credit squeeze engineered
by the monetary authority to stem a rush for the U.S. Currency
arising from attractive U.S. Interest rates and Gulf tension,
dealers said.
    However, as one dealer noted: "The market is still
unsettled."
    Overnight funds, bid at 20 pct at the outset of business,
traded up to 30 pct before easing as liquidity dragged offers
down to 10 pct by the close. Tomorrow-next, for which buy/sell
quotes started at 30, 20 pct, ended at 14, eight.
    Spot-next was indicated at 8-1/2, seven after opening bids
of 10. Dealers quoted one-week at eight, seven against an early
9-1/2, 7-1/2.
    One month rates were at the same level after trade at eight
then 8-1/2. Dealers quoted three months at seven, 6-3/4 pct and
six-month to one year funds at seven, six pct. They reported
offshore offers of overnight at 10, tomorrow-next at eight and
one year at 6-1/2 pct towards the close.
     The Central Bank fixed its dinar exchange rate steady at
0.27933/67 to the dollar, against yesterday's 0.27939/73. The
spot dinar was 0.27930/40.

The Louvre agreement by the Group of Seven
finance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencies
has worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at the
economic summit in Venice on June 8-10, U.K. Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.
    Previewing the summit, which he expected would not produce
any major new economic initiatives, Lawson told reporters work
remained to be done on improving the conditions for lasting
world economic growth.&#5;&#30;side measures to boost growth, he said.

    "I think it is possible that there may be scope for a
further reduction in interest rates in Germany," he added, but
stressed that he had had no indication that such a move was
likely. He made no mention of Japanese interest rates.
    Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on "a gradual reduction
of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years."
    He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced
"satisfactory exchange rate stability," in part thanks to heavy
coordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, and
he was "content" with sterling's exchange rate.
    Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. May
currency reserves announced today he said, "we have been playing
a very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to a
very much greater extent than we had done hitherto."
    Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement may
falter if member states did not implement the macro-economic
commitments underlying the accord.
    "Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange
rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their
commitments in Paris ... In this respect." He said the U.S.
Budget deficit was "very important."
    Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by
Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawson
said, "what is really needed in Japan is an increase in
merchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical."
    "There is a specific range of consumer and agricultural
goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is
wholly unjustified," he said.
    Lawson doubted that Tokyo's partners would indulge in "Japan
bashing" at the summit especially after the economic stimulation
package and the announcement of Nakasone's plans to increase
Japanese development aid over the next three years.
    Japan's more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchange
membership would also help deflect criticism, he said.
    He said he thought West Germany would instead come under
pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to
jack up faltering economic growth.
    In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bring
forward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts
scheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead with
the privatisation of German national industries.
    On debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British plan
to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries to
make progress in Venice.
    The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign
debt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and World
Bank meetings in Washington earlier this year.
    Lawson said he would seek "to consolidate political backing
for the plan at the Venice summit" and hoped the programme would
be finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank.
    He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and Chase
Manhattan to increase sharply their Third World debt
provisions.
    "First, it is a blow for realism. Second, because the market
response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this
sort of move than they felt before Citicorp," he said.
    U.K. Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations,
strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions.
"They have done it to some extent, they need to do it more,"
Lawson said, adding it was up to the banks themselves to
determine the appropriate size of provisions.
    He also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be
discussed at the summit. "There is a consensus, which we have to
push further."

The scale of foreign exchange intervention
the Bank of England has carried out recently is clear proof of
Britain's determination to stabilise exchange rates as agreed
between the Group of Seven industrialised countries in Paris in
February, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.
    Saying he was "content" with sterling's current value, Lawson
told reporters he wanted "to maintain the exchange rate
stability we have all signed up for." He declined to say if he
favoured a rise or a fall from present sterling levels.
 May currency reserves, out today, showed a record 4.8 billion
stg rise, pointing to massive currency intervention.
    In April, reserves rose a hefty 2.9 billion stg.
    Pointing to the reserves data, Lawson said, "We have been
playing a very full part ourselves" in meeting our commitments
toward exchange rate stability as agreed in Paris.
    "We wish to see it (stability) continuing," he added.
    Asked which techniques were available to preserve
stability, Lawson said both central bank intervention and
interest rate changes could be used to tackle "the market
pressures there are from time to time."
    "Interest rate stability is not an objective in that
sense...Rates have to be moved up and down at times," he added.
    Lawson said he expected intervention to be "sterilised" by
draining excess sterling liquidity from the market through new
issues of government securities and foreign currency sales,
when the market allowed.
    This would limit the inflationary impact of intervention,
he said.
    "Sterilisation will be dictated by market tactics...Not
necessarily in the month in which intervention occurs," Lawson
said. "I am confident that we can sterilise on this scale."

The Bundesbank is unlikely to change
credit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursday
for its last session before the Venice summit, banking
economists and money market dealers said.
    The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month
by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and is
unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates
in the near future, they said.
    The council will meet in Saarbruecken, and the meeting will
be followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT.
    But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was
usually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, and
did not necessarily herald any policy moves.
    Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger said today
there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply
growth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar was
stable against the mark.
    Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo, where the Bundesbank has
opened a representative office, that the West German economy
was now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted
1/2 to one pct in the first quarter.
    Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in
a 3.50/70 pct range for most of this month, after the
Bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a
minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct.
    "They have set this signal and indicated they could maybe
lower market rates even further, but not with the discount or
Lombard," Winfried Hutmann, chief economist of Schroeder,
Munchmeyer, Hengst Investment GmbH said.
    Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said
German rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and
around historical lows for West Germany.
    A further cut in rates would have little impact on the
economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand,
with companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said.
    The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move
on interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve.
"The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder," he said.
    A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them in
line with the new structure of money market rates since last
month, would have little practical significance, dealers said.
    The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a
diplomatic gesture before next week's Venice summit.
    But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made it
clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere "eyewash."
    Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government to
cut taxes, rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetary
policy, to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit.
    But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced tax
cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget
deficit, it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further.
    "The Bonn government will be in a very weak position in
Venice because they can't risk increasing the deficit further,"
said Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst's Hutmann.
    Bethmann's Chrobok said if anything is to happen before
Venice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. "But I
don't expect any convincing measures," he said.
    Money market dealers noted that call money continued to
normalize today, falling to 3.60/70 pct from 3.75/85 yesterday
and as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up by
month-end distortions.
    Call money could come under upwards pressure later this
month because of a major round of tax payments by banks on
behalf of customers, starting in the week beginning June 15.
Two public holidays that week could also distort the market.
    Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate funds
tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55
pct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct,
and to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact.
    But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank would
allocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55. That would not
represent a tightening of policy, however.
    Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates
at the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a full
allocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said.
    On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely
to lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency
Unit (ECU) at one of its meetings soon.
    Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement
on this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of the
Saarland bordering France, and was twice under French
occupation this century.
    But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come
this week, as a number of technical and legal matters had still
to be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would be
treated for minimum reserve purposes.

Fritz Leutwiler, chairman of
BBC AG Brown Boveri und Cie and a former Swiss National Bank
president, urged the National Bank to declare its intent of
achieving a rising rate for the mark against the Swiss franc.
    In a speech to shareholders, Leutwiler said, "A gradually
rising rate for the mark in relation to the franc would be
desirable from the standpoint of industrial exports and with
regard to sustaining Swiss industry."
    "Simply an appropriate declaration of intent by our bank of
issue (Swiss National Bank) could have a positive effect," he
said.
    Leutwiler, who served 10 years as head of the Swiss central
bank, said such a step would not contradict the National Bank's
target of monetary stability.
    "Bringing the franc close to the mark would, of course, have
to be done step by step under the watchful eye of monetary
policy," he told shareholders. "Realistically there is in fact no
persuasive reason why the German currency is quoted almost 20
pct lower than the Swiss."
    A National Bank spokesman said the relation of the mark and
Swiss franc was an example of stable currency parities over a
long period of time.
    The spokesman said exchange rates were made by the market,
not the central bank, and it would be impossible to influence
individual parities separately.
    Leutwiler said the Swiss National Bank could not support
the value of the dollar, even in conjunction with other central
banks, without putting monetary stability in jeopardy.
    "I would be the last to recommend that. The key to a
stronger dollar lies in the United States itself," Leutwiler
said.

Paul Volcker's decision not to go for a
third term as Federal Reserve Chairman and the nomination of
Alan Greenspan to replace him have revived deep concerns about
the U.S.' ability to prevent a further dollar decline and stem
rising inflation, financial market analysts said.
    Although Greenspan is known as a committed anti-inflation
fighter in the Volcker mould, doubts are already surfacing in
the U.S. financial markets as to whether he has enough
political clout and monetary experience to wage a tough
campaign against inflation over the next year or two.
    "The critical issue is how (Greenspan) will deal with
inflation," said Stephen Axilrod, Vice Chairman of Nikko

departure. Until Greenspan answers them, the markets will

    Kaufman said, "Unlike Paul Volcker, who entered the office

domestically and internationally, Mr Greenspan will have to
demonstrate both his competence and policy independence before
he can gain full confidence of the financial markets."
    Greenspan is most knowledgeable on the behavior of the U.S.
economy, while his professional skills in the international
area are much more limited, Kaufman noted.
    "Consequently, although he is well known abroad, his views
on issues such as the Less Developed Country Debt may initially
carry less weight than have those of Mr Volcker."

Currency futures are likely to move
higher following the sharp rally today after President Reagan
announced that Paul Volcker would not accept a third term as
Federal Reserve Chairman and that Alan Greenspan was nominated
as his replacement, currency analysts said.
    Contrary to predictions before the Volcker resignation,
analysts are calling for higher currency futures prices between
now and the June 8 Venice economic summit.
    In particular, uncertainty about Greenspan's attitude to
the dollar could undermine sentiment toward the U.S. currency,
analysts said.
    Greenspan said today that the dollar appeared to be nearing
a bottom, but the market will bear in mind his remarks in
Chicago last week that the dollar's recent move upward was a
technical reaction and that it would trade significantly lower,
analysts said.
   
    "Disappointment of European central bankers over the
appointment will be used as an opportunity to sell the dollar
lower," said Manufacturers Hanover Futures vice president Carol
Mackoff.
    "The international community will not like this
appointment," as it suggests the possibility that the U.S.
budget deficit is too much of a burden on monetary policy and
that Volcker was unable to get the commitment he sought to
reduce the deficit, added Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David
Horner.
     Furthermore, "that Greenspan was not named two months ago
suggests that he was not the Administration's first choice --
and that the status of his appointment was as a bridesmaid,"
Horner said.
    A declining dollar scenario with higher currency futures
prior to and throughout the Venice meetings would be mitigated
only by concrete action as opposed to "jawboning" at the G-7
summit, he said.
    But G-7 finance ministers, judged by recent statements, may
be at an impasse, analysts said.
    Japan and West Germany today reiterated that neither
planned further interest rate cuts, despite pressure from the
U.S. to do so, Mackoff said.
    The U.S., on the other hand, has not cut its budget deficit
as Japan and West Germany have urged, she said.
    Should G-7 members force a U.S. commitment to cut its
budget deficit in the next two years, a further decline in the
dollar could be forestalled, Horner said.
    However, "the impact from Venice will be nothing if nothing
changes," Horner said.
    Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. analyst Craig Sloane
said European currencies will likely move to the higher end of
their 1987 ranges after today's sharp advance.
    For the next two weeks, Sloan calls for September yen
futures to advance toward the 0.007200 area. He said September
marks could close in on 0.5700 as an upside target, while Swiss
francs could climb to a range between 0.6900 and 0.6950.

Analysts said they were surprised at
the government's announcement of a forecast budget surplus for
fiscal 1988 but said it was consistent with previous policy
statements and positive for the economy.
    Finance Minister Roger Douglas predicted a budget surplus
for the year ending March 1988 of 379 mln New Zealand dlrs
against a 1.95 billion deficit last year.
    Analysts polled by Reuters said the forecast budget surplus
was even more positive than the most bullish analysts'
forecasts and that this was good news for financial markets.
    Market expectations among analysts questioned by Reuters
before the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a
2.3 billion dlr deficit. But none predicted a surplus.
    The forecast initially looks positive for both the bond and
the foreign exchange markets, one analyst said. Paradoxically,
the New Zealand dollar could rise in the medium term, despite
lower interest rates, as overseas investors became more
confident about investing in New Zealand, he said.
    However, some foreign exchange dealers disagreed, saying
the local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and will
move lower.
    The local dollar dropped to 0.5940/50 U.S. Dlrs in after
hours trading, against 0.5970/77 just before the budget
release.
    Analysts said the budget was also positive for the share
market, despite an increase in the contribution of company
taxation to revenue figures.
    One equities analyst predicted that the budget surplus
announcement could push the share market up by 50 points
tomorrow.
    The Budget statement was broadly as expected, with a
continuation of existing policies, and the absence of
traditional pre-election incentives would be viewed positively
by overseas investors, another said.
    But one merchant bank economist said that certain anti-tax
avoidance measures could damage some sectors of the share
market, particularly multi-national companies.
    The government is also lowering its borrowing requirements,
through bond tenders, as a result of the surplus. The
requirement for the rest of the year is now down to 950 mln
N.Z. Dlrs from a predicted 1.75 billion.
    Predicted revenue in the Budget looked sustainable and
there appeared to be no holding back on expenditure, another
economist said. He added that the document seemed entirely
credible.
    "Altogether it looks good for Labour's election prospects,"
he said.
    An election is due before the end of September.

New U.S. Banking data suggest the
Federal Reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady path
and is not signalling any imminent change of course, economists
said.
    But they also said that if money supply growth remains
weak, as this week's unexpected eight billion dlr M-1 decline
suggests it may, this could influence the Fed to loosen its
credit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetary
policy.
    A Reuter survey of 17 money market economists produced a
forecast of a 600 mln dlr M-1 decline for the week ended June
8, with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to a
decline of four billion. Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrs
to 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.
    Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 for
the week ended June 1, this means the nation's money supply has
fallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks,
economists said.
    "M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness," said Bill Sullivan
of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
    While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator of
economic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concerned
the latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growth
in the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seen
as better gauges of economic growth.
    Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, both
measures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed's
5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges.
    If money growth does not accelerate, Fed officials,
concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging,
could turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said.
    "Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current open
market position? No," Sullivan said. "But does this mean the end
of tightening for the time being? Definitely yes."
    Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings
of 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement period
were lower than they had expected. Most believed the Fed had
targetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs.
    But they said that if it had not been for a large one-day
net miss in the Fed's reserve projections, the higher
borrowings target would probably have been reached.
    A drop in May U.S. Housing starts and continued weakness in
auto sales show key sectors of the U.S. Economy are lagging,
while a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in May producer prices has
helped dispel inflation fears, Slifer said.
    "If this continues, we can entertain the notion of Fed
easing at some point," he said.
    Other economists said the Fed would probably pay little
attention to weak money supply growth. "It has been a number of
years since M-1 has given good signs of what's going on in the
economy," one said. "I don't think M-1 shows that the economy is
falling apart and the Fed should ease."
    Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a
prerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetary
policy.
    They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term rates
for fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and
higher inflation which would push up long-term yields and choke
off econmomic growth.
    But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late
April. "The Fed has to determine if this represents a
fundamental change for the dollar. If it does, then this gives
them more room to ease," he said.

Recent government moves to curb capital
inflow have temporarily helped to slow the rise of Taiwan's
foreign exchange reserves and to stabilise the local dollar
against the U.S. Currency, officials and bankers said.
    Central bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the
reserves rose only about 500 mln U.S. Dlrs in the past two
weeks and the local dollar appreciated more slowly against the
U.S. Dollar.
    Chang said, "The pace of increase in our reserves is much
slower now than before and our currency is getting more stable."
He said the reserves, mainly the result of the trade surplus
with the U.S., Rose at the rate of two to three billion U.S.
Dlrs a month between January and May.
    The reserves, the world's third largest after Japan and
West Germany, now total well over 60 billion U.S. Dlrs.
    On June 2 the central bank froze overseas borrowings of
local and foreign banks and cut the limit on central bank
purchases of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40 pct from 90
pct of the value of a contract.
    Local and foreign bankers said the June 2 measures had
drastically limited their ability to lend foreign exchange to
importers and exporters.
    They said their overseas borrowings and forward dollar
transactions showed a drastic decline with some banks
registering a fall of up to 30 pct.
    Bank dealers said the Taiwan dollar has stabilised against
the U.S. Currency this week after rising two to five Taiwanese
cents a day between June 2 and 13 compared with a rise of five
to eight cents in May.
    The bank dealers said the central bank, which had
previously bought U.S. Dollars heavily, sold at least 1.1
billion U.S. Dlrs in the past two weeks to meet commercial
demand.
    They said they expected the government to keep the local
dollar stable in the near term to give breathing space to
businesses experiencing slower exports because of the rise of
more than 23 pct in the value of the Taiwan dollar since
September 1985.
    The Taiwan dollar opened at 31.09 to the U.S. Dollar today,
unchanged from yesterday.
    Keh Fei-Lo, vice president of First Commercial Bank, said,
"It appears the central bank's move to curb the capital inflow
is quite successful."
    Vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said the slower
rise in foreign exchange reserves would help ease pressure from
Washington over the large U.S. Trade deficit with Taiwan.
    Over the past year Taiwanese businessmen have delayed
imports of machinery and production equipment because of
exchange rate uncertainty, he said. The stable exchange rate
would help boost imports, particularly from the United States.

Japan could avoid a sharp rise in the
value of the yen against the dollar if Japan, the U.S. And
other nations succeeded in restructuring their economies, an
advisory panel to the government's Economic Planning Agency
(EPA) said.
    The advisory body said in its report that the yen would
soar against the dollar if structural adjustments on a global
basis were delayed.
    An EPA official told Reuters the dollar could fall to
slightly below 100 yen by 1993 if Japan and the U.S. Failed to
restructure their economies.
    The dollar's fall without structural adjustments would cut
Japan's current account surplus to two pct of gross national
product (GNP) in 1993, the report said. It said such a change
would slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annually
during the seven-year period to 1993.
    If the two nations restructured their economies, the dollar
would remain stable in real terms, while reducing Japan's
current-account surplus to 2.1 pct of GNP in 1993. This
scenario put Japan's GNP growth at 3.5 pct a year.
    It forecast real growth of three pct for the world economy
and four pct for Japan by 2,000 if the adjustments were made.

The limit at the other end of the scale is set at 114.50.

Venezuela's cabinet approved a new

Minister Manuel Azpur UA said.
    Azpur told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the
measure is "fundamental to conserving the economic and financial
strength of the petroleum industry."
     He said the new exchange rate, which goes before the

oil company Petroleos De Venezuela, S.A.(PDVSA) to solve its
problem of working capital and implement investment plans,
estimated at 20 billion bolivars for 1987. He did not say when
the measure would become effective.
   Venezuela's oil industry previously sold its dollar earnings
to the government at 7.50 to the dollar but bought foreign
exchange from its imports at 14.50 bolivars.
   The new exchange rate will promote purchases of domestic
goods and services by the industry, Azpur said. He added that
it would also put PDVSA in a position to purchase more
government debt bonds.                        
    PDVSA had available liquid assets of 20 billion bolivars at
the start of this year, of which nine billion were in a trust

If the dollar goes the way of Wall Street,
Japanese will finally move out of dollar investments in a
serious way, Japan investment managers say.
    The Japanese, the dominant foreign investors in U.S. Dollar
securities, have already sold U.S. Equities.
    But "if the dollar falls steeply, which did not happen
yesterday, Japanese investors will definitely try to withdraw
significant funds from U.S. Shares," said Akira Kawakami, deputy
manager of Nomura Investment Trust and Management Co Ltd's
international investment department.
    An unstable, lower dollar would also affect Japanese
investment in U.S. Bonds. "Japan-U.S. Interest rate
differentials, which currently look wide enough, mean nothing
in the absence of dollar stability," said Kawakami.
    U.S. Bonds could benefit due to a gloomy economic picture
following the estimated huge losses in stocks by major U.S.
Institutional and individual investors, he said. The effect
should be to rule out any U.S. Interest rate rise.
    But most Japanese investors in U.S. Bonds are still wiating
to see if the dollar really is stable, he said. The dollar was
holding firm at above 142 yen on Tuesday morning.
    "Although Japanese investors sold huge amounts of stocks in
New York yesterday, most are still looking for chances to
lighten their U.S. Stock inventories," Hiromitsu Sunada, manager
of Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co's international investment
department said.
    Their sales helped send Wall Street stocks down 508 points
to 1,738, the market's biggest percentage drop since 1914.
    "Investment in U.S. Stocks and bonds is difficult,
considering the dangers," said Katsuhiko Okiyama, deputy general
manager and chief adviser of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's fixed
income securities marketing group.
    Japanese investment at home could start to pick up once
markets have stopped reacting to Wall Street, the managers
said. The Tokyo yen bond market is likely to stabilise in one
or two weeks, which is what investors have been waiting for.
The bottom for yen bonds should be around a 6.3 pct yield for
the 5.1 pct 89th bond, they said.
    "The basic background which has supported the stocks and
bonds markets has not changed," said Norio Okutsu, assistant
general manager of Nikko Securities' bond department. "But new
outflows of funds to the U.S. Will be decreasing."  However,

    But some economists added that Wall Street's crash, which
dragged other major markets down with it, may help curb the
very problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflation
fears and the massive and persistent U.S. Trade deficits.
    "If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street
...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide," said
Geoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments from
other London and Tokyo analysts.
    Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of
further falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationary
pressures and import demand in the U.S., They say.
    Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the
equity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson.
    "It would be suicidal for any government in the context of
what happened in the last couple of days to jack up their
interest rates," he added.
    Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime
lending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fed
chairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financial
system.
    The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock
collapse would spill over into the economy, via a banking
crisis for example, thus precipitating recession.
    It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of
1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880. But economists said
today's whiplash moves do not have long term significance and
that markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in
mind.
    "The United States has been able to live on borrowed time.
If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economic
growth not recession...It contains good news (and) provides a
more realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy," said Capel's
Dennis. But he added that markets are still very much in
danger.
    "The liquidity doesn't disappear...All it's doing is
disappearing from the equity markets," Dennis noted.
    David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said world
market turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven
(G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar,
as implied by West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currencies
is still on.
    Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered by
expectations that the Germans were more worried about the money
supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency
stability.
    But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad, said
Morrison. "The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived. To
stabilise the dollar at too high a level is wrong," he said.

The United States appears to have won a
transatlantic battle by forcing the Bundesbank to trim interest
rates, European economists said.
    But they added Washington set the stakes high by testing
the limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets were
plunging.
    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment to
currency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt,
according to official statements released late Monday.
    Only 13 hours after the statements were released, the
Bundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banks
liquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, down from a 3.85 pct
facility rate offered last week.
    While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbank
president Karl Otto Poehl, the central bank had also added
money market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want a
strong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday.
     "It's round one to the Americans, " said Richard Reid,
senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew in
London.
    But Reid added, "We shouldn't forget that it has taken one
of the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the West
Germans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05
percentage point."
    Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of earlier tightening
of West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall and
fuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid.
    Six leading industrial nations agreed under February's
Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetary
policies. It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven -
the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
    The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency markets
and the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading
in New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar was
quoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday.
    Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at Deutsche
Genossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on world
stock markets had been the main reason for the fall in West
German short-term interest rates on Tuesday.
    "The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market
losses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fits
with Baker's wishes, then all the better," he said.
    No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and the
Bundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises
in the U.S., Aschoff said.
    Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the central
bank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he
thought the global rate increase was a cause for concern.
    Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First Boston
Ltd in London said "The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreat
and Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as the
security repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it was
before the IMF meeting last month in Washington."
    Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord was
reaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidity
at 3.60 pct, Keating noted.
    Economists said the United States now appeared to have
agreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and support
the dollar in return for the German action on interest rates.
    Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder
Washington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenberg
told a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not rule
out central banks of leading industrial countries intervening
on exchange markets to defend the dollar's value.
    Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed West
Germany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency
stability. In addition, both the U.S. And West German central
banks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force them
to again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar.

As official Washington sought to
restore investor confidence after Monday's Wall Street
collapse, Treasury Secretary James Baker came under fire from
critics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis.
    Baker's weekend blast at the West German Bundesbank for
boosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of an
international accord to stabilize currency values.
    Nigel Lawson, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, was
among those who said the treasury secretary's statements helped
spur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investors
think that a clash between the two major economic powers would
damage the world economy.
    Lawson told a London television interviewer Tuesday, "I
think the scale of the (stock) fall was very great. That, I
think, was partly due to statements that have been made by
senior figures on the other side of the Atlantic." It was a
dispute that should never have happened, he added.
    Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at a
hastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday, he  
still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the United
States on Tuesday. Baker cut short a long-planned trip to
Scandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis.
    Said one U.S. analyst of Baker's weekend remarks, "His
timing could not have been worse."
    One government bond salesman in New York said, "He actually
thought that yelling at the Germans, and threatening to smack
the dollar down would work. That doesn't show much
understanding of international monetary gamesmanship."
    However, some analysts said West Germany's stubborn march
toward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand.
    "On the surface Baker may look responsible for this, but if
you go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financial
markets), it was West German policy," said Robert Brusca of
Nikko Securities International in New York.
    "All Mr. Baker did was to mention the obvious in public, so
making him responsible for it was a little like killing the
messenger," he said.
    After Monday's talks, the U.S. and West German governments
made it clear that the Louvre currency accord, pieced together
in Paris in February, was still in effect.
    Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might be
a prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar to
the late 1970s. Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crash
wiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values.
   Treasury sources said that Baker, already unhappy about
Bonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the
global recovery moving, was angered by a Bundesbank interest
rate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite.
    He felt that the U.S. recovery, inching along in its 59th
month, could no longer be the only engine of global economic
expansion. A growing U.S. economy has been serving as a huge
market for debtor country exports.
    Moreover, Baker, the consummate politician, was worried
that the Republican party might face next year's presidential
election with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badly
tarnished.
    A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt
crisis and completely choke off U.S. economic growth that has
already slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate.
    "There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the
economy, and it's important that the psychology turn around
quickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, and
eventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically,"
former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in a
television interview.
    In many ways, the official response was mild.
    Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat,
with President Reagan speaking for most people by admitting
that he was "puzzled."
    U.S. government sources said the secretary immediately
returned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developments
and, presumably, their political impact.
    For all of this, it seems unlikely that Baker's status in
Washington will diminish because of the market fall.
    Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll because
of the Wall Street retreat, Texas Democratic Senator Lloyd
Bentsen said with some irony, "Oh, I think it's much too late to
be doing that...You have an administration that's taken the
attitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and ---
retire to the living room to take a nap. You just can't do
that."

News of a meeting between U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker and West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg on Monday soothed currency markets, allowing the
dollar to recoup much of the day's losses, dealers said.
    News of the meeting, which took place in Frankfurt in great
secrecy, came after the dollar fell sharply on criticism by
Baker of West German monetary policy, which had provoked fears
that the Louvre pact on currency stability was in jeopardy.
    The dollar reacted immediately to the news, rising over two
pfennigs in after hours New York trading, dealers there said.
    The announcement of the meeting, also attended by
Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, was made simultaneously
in Bonn and Washington, timed for after the closure of New York
markets.
    Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl agreed to pursue the policies
accepted under the February Louvre accord, a finance ministry
spokesman in Bonn said.
    The dollar rose to 1.7970/90 marks from New York's close of
1.7730/40. It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks.
    The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the market
reacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interest
rates, and stock markets crashed worldwide. Baker had said that
West Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord.
    Under the accord, leading industrial democracies pledged to
coordinate economic policies to foster currency stability, with
the surplus countries, West Germany and Japan, stimulating
their economies and the U.S. promising to cut its budget
deficit.
    West German government sources said rising West German
money market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvre
pact. They were rather a direct reaction to higher interest
rates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been rising
since May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fed
raised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50.
    German yields have also risen over this period, but less
markedly, and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged up
short-term rates by changing the terms on its security
repurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering the
money market.
    The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct,
compared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany's
inability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends,
but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in the
Bundesbank central bank council about excessive monetary
growth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation,
bank economists said.
    This monetary tightening reflected a switch from the
pragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl
since early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to the
more cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger.
    In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit,
the Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity this
morning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S.
anger over the most recent West German interest rate rises.
    "They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too much
under American fire," said Chris Zwermann, currency adviser at
Swiss Bank Corp here.
    "It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite a
significant retreat from its position," added Giles Keating,
economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London.
    The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms of
the Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pact
on Tuesday, and its result on Wednesday, money market
economists said.
    Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbank
does not want a further strong rise in the tender allocation
rate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct,
little changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility.
    The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indication
that the meeting would take place, although the Finance
Ministry spokesman said it had been arranged last week.
    Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman, asked to
comment on the apparent U.S.-German clash over the Louvre
accord, went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying he
assumed monetary cooperation would continue.
    The spokesman said he believed Baker had already left West
Germany for Sweden on Monday. This week he is also due to visit
Denmark and Belgium.

International monetary officials will

The Louvre accord on currency stability,
which has maintained an uneasy calm in currency markets since
last February, appeared in serious danger today as a
transatlantic dispute over West German interest rates came to
the boil, foreign exchange dealers said.
    But as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock and
bond markets plunged, officials in the major industrial
countries played down the dispute as a bilateral problem
between the United States and West Germany and insisted that
the currency pact was still alive.
    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the market
fears when he attacked the rise in West German short-term
interest rates. "That's not in keeping with the spirit of what
we agreed to as recently as earlier this month in Washington,"
Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday. He was
referring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Group
of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed the
pact.
    Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan, who both
have large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their economic
growth to take in more exports from the U.S., While the U.S.
Agreed to stop talking the dollar down.
    However, Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvre
agreement was still operative, the West German interest rate
move would force the U.S. To re-examine the accord.
    "The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker that
he's going to hammer Germany ... He has just declared all bets
are off in terms of currency cooperation," Chris Johns, currency
analyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said.
    But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguine
view, telling Reuters that "the exchange market is apparently
reacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker
comment will regret it later on."
    French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, who hosted the
Louvre meeting, was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers to
respond directly to Baker's remarks. He called for "a faithful
and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the
Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit."
    Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the British
Treasury commented on the row.
    But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despite
U.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, "this does
not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the
Louvre Accord."
    In Frankfurt F. Wilhelm Christians, joint chief executive
of West Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, said that
following recent meetings with Baker, he believed that the U.S.
Was still committed to the accord.
    In a move which the market interpreted as a possible
gesture of reconciliation, the Bundesbank added short-term
liquidity to the West German money market at 3.80 pct on
Monday, down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injected
medium-term liquidity last week. The Bank of France also
stepped into the French money market to hold down rates,
injecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after rates rose
close to eight pct.

West German government sources said Bonn
remained committed to the Louvre Accord to stabilise
currencies, which was struck by leading western democracies in
Paris last February.
    Over the weekend, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
criticised recent rises in West German short-term interest
rates and said such developments were not in the spirit of the
Louvre pact. He said the agreement may have to be re-examined.
    The sources said the West German interest rate rises had to
be seen in the context of interest rate developments worldwide.

The Federal Reserve is expected to enter
the government securities market to supply reserves to the
banking system via system repurchase agreements, economists
said.
    Most economists said the Fed would execute three-day system
repurchases to meet a substantial need to add reserves in the
current maintenance period, although some said a more
aggressive add via overnight system repos was possible.
    Federal funds opened at 7-5/8 pct and remained at that
level late this morning, compared with an average effective
rate of 7.55 pct Friday.

Today's sharp sell-off of Swiss stocks and
matching falls around Europe may have been overdone, but the
mood on financial markets is precarious, Swiss securities
analysts and economists said.
    Panic selling took Swiss shares down six pct at the opening
on enormous volume, triggered by the slide on Wall Street and
the threat of renewed currency instability.
    "I have never experienced anything like this, and I've been
in the business for 20 years," said Bernhard Wyttenbach, head of
European research at Union Bank of Switzerland.
    The analysts blamed the sell-off in Europe on U.S. Monetary
authorities. This weekend, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
publicly voiced his displeasure with West German monetary
policy. He said the eight-month-old Louvre accord to stabilise
currencies was still working, but added: "On the other hand, we
will not sit back and watch surplus countries jack up interest
rates and squeeze growth on the expectation that the United
States will raise rates."
    Hans Peter Ast of Societe Generale Alsacienne (Sogenal) in
Zurich said: "The situation is very dangerous. Statements by the
U.S. Authorities have fuelled anxiety about interest rates."
    Herbert Fritschi, director of Zurich Cantonal Bank's
financial research department, called the sell-off "overdone,"
but warned that the situation could worsen unless central banks
loosen their monetary policy.
    "I think the trend toward higher interest rates is over," he
said. "The Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank have to step in
with an easy money policy, or else there is going to be an
economic catastrophe. They have to act quickly."
    Wyttenbach said the "Black Monday" sell-off was clearly
exaggerated, with Swiss Reinsurance Co participation
certificates falling 20 pct in value at one point.
    But Wyttenbach said he did not believe that a correction
would come soon. First, the bad news will reach small investors
only in time for tomorrow's market, when there could be
another, smaller selling wave.
    "As soon as the dollar stabilises -- and that's the key --
then we'll get a strong movement upward," Wyttenbach said. But
that may not come soon.
    "People are simply worried that in America, where the market
has now fallen by 18 pct since August, the bull market is over,"
he said. "People are afraid that we'll have a recession in 1988."
    Baker was wrong to blame the West Germans for the current
problems and the weak dollar, Wyttenbach said. "We do not have a
mark problem, we have a dollar problem," he added, but said the
biggest culprit was the new chairman of the U.S. Federal
Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan.
    Wyttenbach recalled that Greenspan had suggested that the
dollar might be too high in the medium term and that interest
rates might have to rise. "As a central banker he shouldn't do
that," Wyttenbach said. "There is a danger that we will fall back
into the 1970s," he said. "We have a real crisis of confidence in
Greenspan. I would much rather have a Volcker."
    Paul Volcker retired as Fed chairman on August 11.
    Cantonal Bank's Fritschi said: "I'm relatively optimistic
because the situation looks too bad. The Fed certainly has to
intervene."
    He said he did not expect the Swiss National Bank to take
any significant steps, adding that the focus of attention
remains on the United States.
    "The panic started in New York, it has to end there."
    The Cantonal Bank sent an advisory to customers suggesting
they not sell into a panicked market, but wait a while before
deciding what to do.

Deutsche Bank AG joint chief executive
Friedrich Wilhelm Christians said he believed the Louvre accord
on currency stability was still intact.
    Christians told a news conference he met U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker in the last two weeks, after short term
German interest rates had risen twice.
    "I am sure that with 1.7720 marks the dollar is still within
the Louvre agreement. I do not see that the accord has been
terminated," Christians said. He was responding to questions
about comments by Baker, who said the Louvre accord was still
operative but criticised rises in West German interest rates.

Karl Otto Poehl, head of West Germany's
central bank, and Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg are
normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the
central bank's independence.
    But a rare public row between the ebullient Poehl,
president of the Bundesbank, and Stoltenberg, over a
controversial investment tax proposal, has added to the woes of
the country's already nervous financial markets, bankers said.
    Poehl told an investment symposium in Frankfurt last
Thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and
interest rates
    Stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting Poehl's
criticism, saying West Germany would remain an attractive place
for foreign investors.
    "The obvious lack of coordination between the Bundesbank and
Finance Ministry does not instil confidence in foreign
investors," said one economist for a London broker, who asked
not to be identified.
    Bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial
policy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship to
steer the economy through a particularly difficult time.
    "There are plenty of objective pressures which will result
in things getting back to normal again after a period of ill
feeling," said Commerzbank AG chief economist Juergen Pfister.
    News on October 9 that the government was planning a 10 pct
withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in
a market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and
abroad.
    Bankers said the Bundesbank was angered by the way the
finance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting the
Bundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflicting
details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market.
    Both Poehl, 57, and Stoltenberg, 59, have been under
extraordinary pressures lately.
    Poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his
deputy, Helmut Schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fight
inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had
pursued so far this year to promote currency stability.
    In recent statements Poehl has sounded more like
Schlesinger. For years the softly-spoken economist has been
warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply
growth would eventually lead to rising prices.
    Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbank
council, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent his
views, bankers said.
    "Poehl is in a minority in his own house," said Commerzbank's
Pfister.
    "Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is not
entirely his own," said another economist.
    The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far,
they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the mark
and hurting West German exporters.
    The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the
Bundesbank's new tack became clear in early October.
    Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary James
Baker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases.
    Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986
war of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S.
Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany to
stimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports.
    One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a round
of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.
    But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for
Stoltenberg than he had bargained for.
    The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly voted
most popular government politician last year, had to face
resistance from local barons in the government coalition
parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.
    The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising
4.3 billion marks.
    But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it will
push up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs the
government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.
    Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row
which has turned into the country's worst political scandal.
    Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington last
month early to sort out a row in the northern state of
Schleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party.
    The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign after
allegations of a "dirty tricks" election campaign led to heavy
losses for the CDU in state elections.
    Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva last
weekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide.
    Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the more
remarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, and
was appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
    When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier this
year, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition government
gave Poehl another eight-year term.
    Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said he
hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.
    But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he was
not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the
Bundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said.

Venezuelan Central Bank President Hernan
Anzola has submitted his resignation and asked President Jaime
Lusinchi to transfer him to a post in the oil industry, two
leading Venezuelan newspapers reported.
    The El Universal and El Nacional papers said Anzola would
leave his position soon. Lusinchi already has decided on his
successor, the El Nacional reported.
    Central Bank officials were not available for comment.

    Banking sources said Anzola differed with the Finance
Ministry over economic policy, particularly over the direction
of interest rates. He favoured raising the rates, which are
currently well below the annual inflation rate of 33.2 pct.
    But the sources said he ran into opposition from Finance
Ministry and government officials who thought an interest
increase would fuel inflation.

French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur
issued a firm call for the continued faithful application of
the Louvre accords on currency stability by all major
industrial countries.
    Balladur, responding to weekend remarks by U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker that the U.S. Would take another look at
the accords, said "I firmly desire a faithfull and firm
adherence by all the major industrial countries to the Louvre
accords -- in both their letter and spirit."
    On Sunday, Baker said last week's rise in short-term West
German interest rates was not in keeping with the accords.

    The Louvre accords, agreed in Paris last February, called
for stability among the major currencies after a prolonged
dollar slide.
    The accords were reaffirmed by the Group of Seven Finance
Ministers in Washington last month.
    But Baker said at the weekend that the West German rate
rise was "not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to."
    "What I'm really saying is that they should not expect us to
simply sit back here and accept increased tightening on their
part on the assumption that somehow we are going to follow
them," he added.

South Africa must drive down its
inflation rate to much lower levels to prevent a further
decline in the rand, said Volkskas Bank in its monthly economic
review.
    The bank said that without a major drop in the inflation
rate, the rand was bound to eventually decrease even more,
regardless of a sharp rise in the gold price.
    Inflation is running at an annual rate of some 17 pct and
the rand is around 49.53 U.S. Cents. Most economists estimate
continued high inflation.
    Volkskas predicted the rand will remain fairly steady for
the rest of 1987 and then ease slightly next year.

Lebanon's Bankers Association said it
extended its suspension of trading in the Lebanese pound for
two more working days to study ways to stem the currency's
collapse.
    The Central Bank did not post the rate of the pound to the
dollar and other currencies on Monday. The pound closed on
Thursday at 407.00/412.00 to the dollar compared with
Wednesday's close of 384.00/386.00.
    Association sources told Reuters Friday's suspension of
trading for two working days was continued on Monday for two
more days so as to study proposals to reinforce the pound.
    The Association, which comprises 106 commercial banks in
east and west Beirut, halted trading on Friday in a chaotic
market after the pound crashed to four record lows in the week.
    The pound, hit by the inability of Lebanon's religiously
and ideologically divided government to end 12 years of civil
war, has lost more than 80 pct of its international value this
year.

The Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations
still comply with last February's Louvre accord to stabilize
currencies, a senior Bank of Japan official said.
    And U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks at the
weekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lower
range for the dollar, other senior officials from the Bank of
Japan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews.
    "The exchange market is apparently reacting too much, and
anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it
later on," the Bank of Japan official told Reuters.
    The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk the
dollar down. A lower dollar would harm the U.S. Economy, he
noted.
    A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved in
monetary talks with other nations also said the U.S. Would
never attempt to lower the reference range for the dollar
against the mark or the yen.
    The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between
140-150 yen and between 1.70 and 1.90 marks.
    The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 1.7730/35 marks and
141.35 yen.
    "Behind Baker's remark was U.S. Frustration over higher
interest rates abroad, especially in West Germany, but this
does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework
of the Louvre accord," the Finance Ministry official said.
    He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid any
further rise in U.S. Interest rates because it would not only
hurt the U.S. Economy but aggravate the Third World debt
problem.
    Higher U.S. Interest rates would merely raise their
interest payment burden and depress U.S. Stock and bond markets
further, the monetary officials said.
    Both the ministry and central bank officials, who declined
to be named, noted the U.S. No longer wants to see a further
decline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationary
expectations in the U.S.
    "That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvre
agreement is still operative," the senior ministry official
said.
    Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday that
Washington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of West
Germany's increase in short-term interest rates.
    The market at first interpreted this as indicating the U.S.
Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollar
decline further unless surplus countries, notably West Germany,
try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in the
accord, foreign exchange dealers said.
    But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additional
statement that "the Louvre agreement is still operative," and
this caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today, the
dealers said.
    Uncertainty, however, remained the flavour of the day in
Tokyo currency markets.
    The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguised
pressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rates
higher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance,
or international economic policy coordination.
    The G-7, comprising the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,
France, Italy and Canada, have agreed to monitor each other's
economic policies and from time to time apply "peer pressure" to
persuade others to change their policies to a desired course,
they noted. "Without such a basic agreement of multilateral
surveillance, Baker would never have criticized the West German
policy so openly," the ministry official said.
    The U.S.-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policy
should thus be regarded as a process of healthy policy
coordination and not as any indication of a possible collapse
of the Louvre agreement, the official said.
    He also said Japan has not received any specific request
from the U.S. On its monetary policy, although its short-term
money rates have been edging higher.
    "This is because we, unlike the Germans, are not taking
policy to guide interest rates higher, and the marginal rate
rise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons," he
added.

An income tax surcharge and capital
gains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of
the N.Z. Dollar, independent economist Len Bayliss said.
    Bayliss, a former economist with the Reserve Bank and the
Bank of New Zealand, said a major depreciation is needed to
restore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by
current government policies.
    The taxes would help cut the budget deficit, which in turn
would lower the value of the N.Z. Dollar, he said in a speech.
He added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 could
be much higher than the government's 1.3 billion dlr forecast.
    Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a
percentage of gross domestic product, a major tax increase was
probably unavoidable, Bayliss said.
    He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct
value-added goods and services tax, introduced in October 1986,
but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact.
Import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary
impact of a currency depreciation.
    The government had failed to bring inflation down despite
lower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency, he added.
    New Zealand's inflation rate was 16.9 pct in the year to
end-September against 18.9 pct in the year to end June.
    The major deficiency in the government's anti-inflation
policies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and
insufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit, Bayliss
said. The government had also failed to reduce overseas debt
and debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit.
    "The widespread belief that (New Zealand's) problems are
going to take much longer to solve than was originally thought
is soundly based -- primarily because the government's
macro-economic policies have been unsuccessful," Bayliss said.

Tokyo's foreign exchange market is watching
nervously to see if the U.S. Dollar will drop below the
significant 140.00 yen level, dealers said.
    "The 140 yen level is key for the dollar because it is
considered to be the lower end of the reference range. If the
currency breaks through this level, it may decline sharply,"
said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager at Dai-ichi
Kangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division.
    The dollar was at 141.10 yen at midday against Friday
closes of 142.35/45 in New York and 141.35 here.
    The dollar opened at 140.95 yen and fell to a low of
140.40. It was 1.7733/38 marks against 1.7975/85 in New York
and 1.8008/13 here on Friday, after an opening 1.7700/10.
    The currency's decline was due to remarks on Sunday by U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker, dealers said.
    "The dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearish
sentiment after Baker's comments," said Dai-ichi's Tanaka. He
said this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation among
the group of seven (G-7) industrial nations to implement the
Louvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying.
    The dollar's fall was also prompted by a record one-day
drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday and weakness
in U.S. Bond prices, dealers said.
    Baker said the Louvre accord was still operative but he
strongly criticised West German moves to raise key interest
rates. Operators took Baker's comment to indicate impatience
with some G-7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accord
due to their fears of increasing inflation.
    Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationary
pressures also slow domestic demand.
    West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G-7 meetings to
boost domestic demand to help narrow the huge U.S. Trade
deficit, Tanaka said.
    U.S. August trade data showed the U.S. Deficit at a still
massive 15.68 billion dlrs. But if West Germany raises interest
rates, this would run counter to the pledge, he said.
    "Operators are now waiting to see if the G-7 nations
coordinate dollar buying intervention," said Soichi Hirabayashi,
deputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltd's foreign exchange
department.
    The target range set by the Louvre accord is generally
considered to be 140.00 to 160.00 yen, dealers said.
    "The market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the near
future and at that time, if operators see the G-7 nations
failing to coordinate intervention, they would see the Louvre
accord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively,"
Hirabayashi said. He said the U.S. Currency could fall as low
as 135 yen soon.
