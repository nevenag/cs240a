Pakistan is likely to produce a record
7.6 mln bales (375 lbs each) of cotton from the current 1986/87
crop, exceeding a target of 7.2 mln bales, Food and Agriculture
Minister Mohammad Ibrahim Baluch said.
    He told a Pakistan Central Cotton Committee meeting here
the present was the third consecutive poroduction
record-setting year and said the momentum would be accelerated
in the future, the official APP news agency reported.
    Baluch said indications were that Pakistan is to attain a
record cotton production of 7.6 mln bales, compared to the
1985/86 crop of 7.2 mln bales which also represented the target
earlier set by authorities for this year's production.

Brazil's 1986/87 cotton crop estimate
has been reduced to 710,000 from 735,000 tonnes (lint basis),
the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Sao Paulo said in
a field report.
    The report, dated April 7, said the reduction is based on
an expected smaller harvest in the center-south region.
    The center-south crop is now estimated at 550,000 tonnes --
25,000 tonnes below the previous estimate.
    Hot, dry weather during part of January and excessive rains
in some areas in February reduced yield prospects and may have
affected quality, the report said.
    Nearly 60 pct of the crop has been harvested in Parana and
slightly less in Sao Paulo, it said. Cotton entering gins is of
fairly good quality, according to trade sources, it said.

The U.S. Agriculture Department
announced the prevailing world market price, adjusted to U.S.
quality and location, for Strict Low Middling, 1-1/16 inch
upland cotton at 50.57 cts per lb, to be in effect through
midnight April 16.
    The adjusted world price is at average U.S. producing
locations (near Lubbock, Texas) and will be further adjusted
for other qualities and locations. The price will be used in
determining First Handler Cotton Certificate payment rates.
    The department said since the adjusted world price is above
the loan repayment rate of 44 cts per lb for the base quality,
no First Handler Cotton Certificates will be issued during the
period.
    Based on data for the week ended April 9, the adjusted
world price for upland cotton is determined as follows, in cts
per lb --
        Northern European Price -- 62.88
                 Adjustments --
 Average U.S. Spot Mkt Location --  9.98
         SLM 1-1/16 Inch Cotton --  1.80
          Average U.S. Location --  0.53
             Sum of Adjustments -- 12.32

Commodities from gold to grains to
cotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as losses
in the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears of
inflation and economic instability.
    Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in New
York, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs a
troy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.
    A key factor behind the advance was anticipation that
inflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations
to halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said Steve
Chronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,
Harris Upham and Co., in New York.
    The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from
the seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their
commitment to support its value, and despite reports of
intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.
    Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, known
as the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-term
direction of the currency markets.
    "Maybe they have some ideas or plans," said Chronowitz. "If
they do, it's not evident."
    "It looks like there's no cure but to let the free market
take values to where they should be.
    "One way or another, we will force our major trading
partners to stimulate their economies," as a measure to correct
the mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said.
    "I think the markets believe, and have believed for a long
time, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It's
going to be a long and tedious process, but that's what's
happening," he said.
    The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commodities
cheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.
    At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bonds
saw the value of their investments falling and many are turning
to commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said Marty
McNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house of
Dominick and Dominick.
    The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout
the commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cotton
posted broad gains.
    Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in the
grain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome
supplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulate
export demand.
    After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department
raised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union by
two mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.
    Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderately
higher.
    Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They said
hogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal at
this time of year, and farmers have been too busy with field
work to market animals.

China is negotiating with Pakistan to
buy 5,000 tonnes of cotton this year, after importing the same
amount last year under a barter agreement, Chinese consulate
sources said.
    Chinese ambassador Tian Ding told a meeting of Pakistani
industrialists on Thursday that China intended to increase
imports from Pakistan to reduce a trade imbalance.
    Pakistani officials estimate the country's cotton output
from the current crop at a record 7.6 mln bales (375 pounds
each). Last year's output totalled 7.2 mln bales and domestic
consumption was just below three mln bales, they said.

The West Texas cotton crop was largely
unscathed by an isolated thunderstorm in that region last night
that packed hurricane-force winds, crop and weather experts
said.
    "There might have been some isolated storms, but certainly
nothing damaging," said Charles Stichler, an extension
agronomist with the Agricultural Extension Service in far West
Texas.
    Rumors of a damaging storm in West Texas helped the New
York cotton futures market rally sharply this morning.
   Cotton for December delivery was 1.35 cents higher at 70.95
cents a lb at midsession after peaking this morning at 71.25
cents.
    "What happened is that the storm hit Lubbock airport, and
when that happens, everybody sees it," said Dale Mohler, a
senior meteorologist with Accu-Weather Inc.
    Lubbock is the heart of the West Texas cotton region, which
produces about 80 pct of that state's crop.
    The storm produced winds of about 75 mph. "That's hurricane
force. But they were isolated to just a small portion of the
West Texas area, probably less than five pct," Mohler said.
    "No doubt there was some damage. But if it had hit in July
or August (when fruiting would be underway) it would have been
worse," Mohler said.
    About 60 pct of the West Texas cotton crop has been
planted, and the remainder could be done by the weekend if
weather remains hot and dry, Stichler said.
    The temperature in West Texas since mid-week has been about
95 degrees. But a hot spell was sorely needed after far heavier
than normal rainfall for several weeks, he said.

Ivory Coast rainfall this season has
been less than in previous years, but 1986/87 cocoa and coffee
production has not suffered, the official Ivorian daily
Fraternite Matin reported.
    The newspaper did not speculate on whether recent dry
conditions seriously threatened the main 1987/88 cocoa crop.
Trade sources said the weather up to now could be irrelevant if
there is good rainfall in coming weeks.
    Precipitation during the present campaign has been lowest
in northern savannah regions, where the cotton crop has
especially benefitted from the dry weather, Fraternite Matin
said.
    Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said earlier this
month 1986/87 cotton output would be a record 213,506 tonnes,
compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985/86.
    Fraternite Matin said the mainstays of Ivorian agriculture
had been little affected by the dry weather. Coffee does not
need very much water to survive and only old cocoa plants have
been affected in some regions, it added.
    London-based dealer Gill and Duffus recently forecast
1986/87 Ivory Coast cocoa output at a record 590,000 tonnes,
which compares with 585,000 estimated for 1985/86. It described
early development of the new main crop as patchy.
    The U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) earlier this year
forecast a drop in 1986/87 coffee production in the Ivory Coast
due to drought in the western part of the country. It estimated
the crop at 3.84 mln bags compared with the previous year's
4.33 mln bag harvest.
    Ivorian officials have only described this year's coffee
crop as "normal."

The Reserve Bank of India, RBI,
announced new rules to allow exporters of 25 products to use
foreign exchange up to 10 pct of their firm's total annual
export earnings for export promotion abroad.
    The move is designed by the government to improve India's
trade deficit.
    Products eligible for the new Blanket Exchange Permit
Scheme include tea bags, cigarettes, coffee, leather, various
textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastics, engineering and
electronic goods, ready-made garments, processed food, sports
goods, fabricated mica and consultancy services.
    The scheme replaces current rules which allow different
amounts of foreign exchange to be used only when firms attain a
minimum annual turnover prescribed for each product.
    RBI said under the new rule, 16 other products will
qualify, on a discretionary basis, for overseas promotional
spending of not more than two pct of the freight-on-board value
of annual export earnings.
    These include oil cakes, cereals, raw cotton, raw and
semi-processed leather, gems, castor and sandalwood oil,
psyllium husks and seeds, opium and various mineral ores.
    RBI said exporters of products not covered by either of the
two groups will be eligible to use up to five pct of their
freight-on-board value of their annual export earnings.
    Industry sources said the new entitlements, considerably
higher than the previous limits, are also more flexible because
holders of new permits no longer need to frequently apply to
RBI for release of foreign exchange for export purposes.

The Pakistani government allowed the
private sector to export cotton and rice in a new trade policy
announced to cover the next three years.
    Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a
televised speech it was also decided to allow duty-free import
of cotton yarn.
    Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which have
been handled exclusively by state corporations since early
1970s. Haq said now the private sector would export cotton and
rice along with the state corporations.
    He said duty-free import of cotton yarn was allowed to make
high quality yarn available to local ancillary industries and
to enable them to compete effectively in the world market. This
would help overcome domestic shortages of yarn, he said.

Pakistani government allowed freer
cotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimed
at narrowing the country's yawning trade gap.
    Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a
televised speech the government had also decided to allow
duty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industry
more competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export of
Pakistani products.
   
    Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which have
been handled exclusively by state corporations since early
1970s.
    But Haq said now the private sector would also export
cotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets a
long-standing demand of the local traders.
    The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed to
bring down prices and help the local ancillary industries
compete effectively in the world market, he said.
   
    Haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year
1987/88 beginning on July 1, would be for three years but
reviewed every year.
    It was a departure from the previous practice of announcing
trade policies for a single fiscal year, and Haq said it would
enable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over a
longer period.
    He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been provided
for the export of engineering goods to selected third world
countries on soft credit terms.
   
    Pakistan's 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs, 18.2 per
cent more than in the previous year, and imports at 5.23
billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86.
    He said the government policy was to rationalise and
streamline import controls.
    "It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports,
specially on raw materials and intermediate goods, local
industry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs," he
said. "Prices have been on the increase and quality of goods
produced has been low. This restrictive policy also gave rise
to smuggling and hampering of exports."
   
    He said that to correct this situation, 136 items had freed
from import restrictions.
    Previously, Pakistan has met its trade gap largely from
remittances from its nationals working abroad, mainly in the
Gulf. However, the remittances have begun to fall after the
drop in oil prices in recent years leading to the spectre of a
balance of payments crisis for Pakistan.

About 60,000 tonnes of harvested
raw cotton may be spoiled by rain in Tanzania's northern
Shinyanga region because it is stored in the open or in crude
village sheds, radio Tanzania reported.
    The cotton, worth one billion shillings, cannot be moved to
ginneries in the region because most mill warehouses are full.
Many mills are not working because of a lack of spare parts, it
added.
    Agriculture Ministry officials have forecast a 1987/88
cotton harvest of about 200,000 tonnes, down from 215,000 in
1986/87.

China expects its 1987 grain harvest to be
397 mln tonnes, eight mln tonnes short of its target, the New
China News Agency quoted a State Statistical Bureau spokesman
as saying.
    The harvest will be China's second highest in history but
poor weather and low incentives for grain-producing farmers
have kept yields down, earlier Chinese press reports said.
    Industry sources expect China to import at least 10 mln
tonnes of grain this year because of the harvest shortfall.
    Chinese customs figures showed grain imports of 9.59 mln
tonnes in the first eight months of 1987, compared with 6.09
mln in the same 1986 period.
    Agriculture Minister He Kang said last month state prices
for grain purchase from growers were to be adjusted to increase
the incentive for grain production.
    China could not afford to become a major food importer, he
said.
    The State Statistics Bureau spokesman also said China's
1987 cotton output was expected to rise 10 pct over 1986 to 390
mln tonnes.
