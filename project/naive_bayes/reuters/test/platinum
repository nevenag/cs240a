Gold bullion continued to move higher
supported by good general buying and was fixed this morning at
436.50 dlrs, 268.368 stg, an ounce, up from Friday's close of
432.00/50, dealers said.
    The setting was the highest since October 8 as gold built
on Friday's gains, which had been based on the weakness of the
dollar and fears of a trade war between the United States and
Japan.
    It opened slightly firmer at 433.50/434.00 and moved up
steadily during the morning supported by commission house and
trade buying, dealers said.
    Dealers said there was resistance around 440.00 but with
sentiment still firm some traders believe the rally may even
take gold as high as 500 dlrs.
    Platinum was fixed this morning at 583.50 dlrs an ounce, up
from Friday's close of 578.50/580.50, and also the highest
setting since October.

The Australian government has given
support in principle to the production of platinum and silver
bullion coins at the Perth Mint, Treasurer Paul Keating said.
    This followed the success of the Australian Nugget gold
bullion coins launched this year, he said in a statement.
    He said that, as with the Australian nuggets, the coins
would be legal tender. The platinum coins would be made in four
weights but the silver coin would be of one ounce weight.
    He said detailed arrangements for their issue would be
finalised after talks between the Federal authorities and the
Western Australian government, owner of the Perth Mint.

A South African trade union is in
dispute with a subsidiary of Britain's Johnson Matthey Plc over
the company's proposal to move a platinum refinery near
Johannesburg to a black tribal homeland.
    The 30,000-member mainly black Chemical Workers Industrial
Union said it fears the planned move to the Bophuthatswana
homeland, where South African unions are not recognised, could
lead to job losses and affect wages.
    A mass dismissal last year at the Impala Platinum Holdings
Ltd &lt;IPLA.J> mines in the tribal homeland sent world platinum
prices rocketing.

    The union said talks with management over the proposed move
had broken down. It said an earlier ballot of refinery workers
showed that most favoured striking over the move but added that
no final decision had been taken on strike action.
    The refinery processes all platinum metals of Rustenburg
Platinum Holdings Ltd, the world's largest platinum producer.
    It is owned by Matthey Rustenburg Ltd, a joint-subsidiary
of Johnson Matthey and Rustenburg which, in turn, is owned by
mining group Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Co Ltd.

Demand for platinum could reach 3.4 mln
ounces by 1991, compared with an estimated offtake of 2.88 mln
in 1986, Chris Clark, platinum marketing director for Johnson
Matthey Plc said.
    Clark told a meeting of the Minerals Research Organisation
in Milton Keynes he foresaw a 250,000 ounce increase in
consumption for use in autocatalysts, currently the largest
single application for platinum.
    Jewellery consumption is set to rise by 70,000 ounces,
Clark predicted in his speech, the text of which was released
in London today.
    Clark said his forecast allowed for only a modest further
increase in investment buying and may well be cautious.
    He said South Africa was the most likely source of
additional supplies and will need to increase output by about
500,000 ounces to meet increased demand.
    The capital investment required to produce the additional
output would be around one billion U.S. Dlrs and the political
climate may make it difficult to raise the money, he said.
    The Soviet Union, whose exports have declined since the
1970s, might increase sales to the West by about 50,000 ounces,
Clark said.
    "The very probability of a growth in demand set against the
massive investment required for expansion - and that expansion
only being viable in South Africa or Russia - leads me to
conclude that the price of platinum will be substantially
underpinned in the medium to long-term," Clark said.
