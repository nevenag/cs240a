14982	Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire D-Wis said he planned to introduce legislation shortly to require greater public disclosure of corporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased the chance that Congress will act to curb abuses We are proposing legislation that would provide for more disclosure would be fairer to all shareholders and would insure that takeovers are properly financed he said Among the provisions the bill would reduce the threshold for notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that a investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within 10 days Proxmire said In addition there would be a pre-notificaton requirement that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have to filed with the SEC Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in knowing about coming takeover attempts Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a tender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60 business days from the current 20 business days His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring company violated the time period on the tender offer To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers Proxmire said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin requirments are properly enforced The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement for purchasing stock but Proxmire said it is not generally enforced in hostile takeovers Rather the groups or individuals leading a takeover declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without actually putting any of their own money Proxmire said He said his bill would allow private suits for damages for failure to meet the Federal Reserves 50 pct margin requirements The bill also would require more disclose when several investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to know about it Proxmire said Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britain towards two-tiered tender offers that insures that all shareholders recieve equal treatment He said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later this month and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring He said he was hopeful Congress could pass a bill this year

15063	Cheap oil feedstocks the weakened US dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined US petrochemical industry to record profits this year with growth expected through at least 1990 major company executives predicted This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp ltGAF privately-held Cain Chemical Inc and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc ltASH the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period said Paul Oreffice chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co ltDOW adding Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics are expected to buy quantities this year US petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year said John Dosher managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct he said Oreffice speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history In 1985 when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong US dollar Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it Oreffice said GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the US chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987 Last year the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs a 54 pct leap from 1985 The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning said Paces John Dosher Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies That helped boost US chemical exports Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s Finally virtually all major US chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts GAF which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp ltUK recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp ltBOR a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals Another industry powerhouse WR Grace ltGRA has divested its retailing restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities such as ethylene in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers Companies like DuPont ltDD and Monsanto Co ltMTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated Dosher said But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market Some top chemical executives share the concern The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes GAFs Heyman cautioned The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised Specialty businesses do not stay special long Houston-based Cain Chemical created this month by the Sterling investment banking group believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend Chairman Gordon Cain who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business has spent 11 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous high-margin business Cain said adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually Garo Armen an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum wood and steel products Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years provided the US economy continues its modest rate of growth

19432	President Reagans nominee as top policeman for the nations securities markets will inherit an agency challenged by an insider trading scandal wild stock price gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the globalization of financial markets David Ruder a 58-year-old Republican law professor at Northwestern University in Evanston Ill was named Thursday to be the 23rd chairman of the five-member US Securities and Exchange Commission If confirmed by the Senate as expected he will succeed John Shad who left the agency earlier this week after a record six years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as its investigators have probed into the most colossal insider trading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street The investigation which is still active mushroomed in recent months as a growing number of well known traders and prominent investment banking firms have been charged with wrongdoing The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November after Ivan Boesky one of Wall Streets most successful stock speculators agreed to cooperate with government investigators and to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegal profits after being charged with insider trading But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices spurred by computer-driven trading strategies that span markets in securities options and futures The price gyrations have combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented volatility to some US securities markets At the same time the SEC is being pressed by some lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers steadily reshapes the US corporate landscape And the agency is being pushed by US and foreign exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork for an international securities marketplace in which trading occurs across borders throughout the world around the clock Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment opportunities but could strain the SECs ability to enforce US securities laws and guard investors from fraud Under the leadership of Shad the SEC eased financial disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies eliminated many minor investor protection rules attempted to spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agencys review of hostile corporate takeovers Shad who had been vice chairman of the E F Hutton investment banking firm brought a Wall Street perspective to the agency upon being named chairman in 1981 In line with the views of other top administration officials he favored marketplace determination of takeover battles over new federal regulations The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that topped the agencys enforcement agenda during the administration of President Jimmy Carter a Democrat Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with Ruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to significantly alter the commissions current priorities The SEC currently has about 2000 employees most of them lawyers and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff The agency is one of the few in the government that actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past few years because of fees it charges public companies investment banks and other securities firms it regulates The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the president to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing for policy differences alone By law no more than three commissioners may be of the same political party and the agency prepares its own budget request each year instead of leaving this to the White House Established by Congress in 1934 the SEC traces its origins to the great stock market crash of 1929 which was attributed in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted market manipulations by large investment firms The agency requires public companies and investment vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on their financial condition and to disclose changes in their condition any time they issue new securities It requires brokers dealers and investment banks to register with it and comply with investor protection rules and it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy an industrial magnate who was also the father of John Kennedy later to become the nations 35th president Other former chairmen include William Douglas who served from 1937 until his appointment to the US Supreme Court in 1939 and William Casey who served during President Nixons first term and was Reagans director of the Central Intelligence Agency until his death earlier this year

17714	The elimination of limits on daily price fluctuations for metals futures contracts traded on the Commodity Exchange COMEX appears to be having little effect on the market analysts said There is nothing apparent from the change said William ONeill director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc The market has not approached the old price limits and trading is relative quiet in narrow ranges he said On May 5 COMEX eliminated price limits on the two contracts following each spot delivery in gold silver copper and aluminum futures after a review of its clearing operations which were severely tested by a volatile market in silver futures at the end of April COMEX announced Friday the lifting of all daily limits effective today Gold futures which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs per ounce in most back months were about 700 dlrs weaker in the nearby contracts amid thin volume conditions traders said Silver futures previously limited at 50 cents in most back months were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the nearby contracts amid quiet trading today During the last week of April silver futures often traded at the daily allowable limit amid concerns about inflation the dollar and other factors Traders rushed into the spot or unlimited contract to offset those moves analysts said As a result ONeill said there was much confusion many unmatched trades and large losses for some traders The COMEX fined four large firms a total of 100000 dlrs for failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner Paul Cain a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panic buying or selling and contribute to more orderly markets ONeill added that the elimination of daily limits would add caution to trading This is a more realistic approach because the metals market is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit ONeill said

14862	South Koreas trade surplus is growing too fast and the government has started taking steps to slow it down Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn-je said He told a press conference the government planned to increase investment speed up the opening of the local market to foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to hold the surplus at a proper level But he said the government would not allow the won to appreciate too much in a short period of time South Korea has been under pressure from Washington to revalue the won The US Wants South Korea to cut its trade surplus with the US Which rose to 74 billion dlrs in 1986 from 43 billion dlrs in 1985 Kim who is also economic planning minister said prospects were bright for the South Korean economy but the government would try to hold the current account surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next five years Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth five billion dlrs of current account surplus and 12 pct growth in exports all seemed to be reasonable early this year But now the surplus is growing faster than we expected he said Trade ministry officials said South Koreas exports rose 35 pct to 934 billion dlrs in the first three months of this year while imports rose only 85 pct to 82 billion dlrs Kim said the swing of South Koreas current account to a surplus of 465 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlr deficit in 1985 was very significant The surplus enabled the country to reduce its foreign debt last year for the first time South Koreas foreign debt which fell to 445 billion dlrs in 1986 from 468 billion in 1985 is still among the largest in Asia This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the major constraints on our development Last year was a major turning point for the Korean economy Kim said Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio of foreign debt to the countrys GNP to about 20 pct in 1991 from about 50 pct in 1986 The government however does not want to accelerate reducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus he said Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflation and lead to trade friction with Seouls major trading partners particularly the United States We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt but we are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at a proper level Kim said

16108	The government must announce harsh cuts in spending in its May 14 economic statement if it is to give an adequate response to Australias economic problems the ANZ Banking Group Ltd ltANZAS said Cuts of two billion dlrs would be insufficient against the backdrop of a 12 billion dlr government deficit and a 14 billion dlr current account deficit it said in its monthly Business Indicators publication For the past two years the government has struggled with an economic reality that demands measures beyond those which it sees as politically practicable it said The political climate meant there would be a continued over-reliance on monetary policy to hold the exchange rate and maintain confidence in economic management ANZ said The cost of this approach is that the much-needed revival of business investment will be further postponed it said The economy was now on a modest growth upswing boosted by export and import-replacement industries which had created a false suggestion that the worst adjustments to the balance of payments crisis were past Unfortunately successful adjustment to Australias deep-seated economic problems remains a long-term process it said In its economic forecasts ANZ said it expected moderate overall economic growth with gross domestic product GDP rising 27 pct this year and 24 pct in 1988 The current account deficit would narrow to five pct of GDP this year and 43 pct in 1988 and net foreign debt would grow strongly from 81 billion at the end of 1986 to 972 billion at end-1987 and 1103 billion a year later Inflation would fall to 85 pct in 1987 and 75 pct in 1988 from 89 pct in 1986 and further falls in real wages were expected ANZ said
16158	The five leading West German economic research institutes have failed to agree about how strongly the domestic economy will expand this year but revised down forecasts contained in a report published six months ago The three research groups of Kiel Hamburg and Essen predicted in the institutes joint spring report that gross national product GNP would rise by two pct in 1987 compared with 24 pct in 1986 The five institutes had jointly forecast three pct 1987 growth in October last year Taking a dissenting view the DIW institute of West Berlin and Munichs Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth The joint report said that the estimates of economic development made by the DIW and Ifo were markedly less favourable than those of the other three The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a slow start to the year In the second half of 1987 there will however only be a weak upward movement they said The two institutes said external economic factors which were currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would dominate the economic environment throughout the year They saw exports falling by a real 2-12 pct in 1987 and predicted no marked improvement in the course of the year The other three institutes however wrote The decline in demand and production seen in the winter months does not indicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate uncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans But they expected that many investments had not been cancelled but only put off It can be presumed that the braking actions on the economy will diminish markedly this year They added The domestic prerequisites for a continuation of the economic uptrend are still favourable These three institutes said diminishing external burdens combined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in demand and production could be expected by the spring However this projection was clouded by risks including the further development of the mark against the dollar Contrary to the DIW and Ifo the three institutes said that while exports would continue to be the weak point of the economy in 1987 there is good reason to believe that exports will soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during the course of the year They predicted an overall 05 pct fall in exports in 1987 the same as in 1986 The three more positive institutes saw private consumption rising by four pct in 1987 compared with 42 pct in 1986 while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase They saw the climate for equipment investment improving but predicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 46 pct in 1986 Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in unemployment The Kiel Hamburg and Essen institutes said the jobless total would average 217 mln in 1987 compared with 223 mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in work of about 200000 These three institutes said new jobs would be created mainly in the private services sector and also by the state in the context of job creation measures The construction industry was likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980 but they predicted either no rise in employment in the manufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur only in the tertiary sector while the number employed in the manufacturing industry will decline The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to 220 mln in 1987 from 223 mln in 1986 They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58 billion marks from 78 billion in 1986 The other three saw a current account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marks and predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around 100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986 The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start to rise in 1987 after they declined in 1986 and all five predicted an average increase over the year of 05 pct
16226	Portugals economy which has been enjoying one of its most buoyant periods in more than a decade may now be strong enough to shrug off the countrys latest government crisis analysts said But the April 3 ousting of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silvas government could slow economic reforms and investment as Portugal continues to adapt to membership in the European Community which it joined in January last year they said Cavaco Silvas minority Social Democratic Party PSD was toppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties The centre-right administration had made economic growth reform a priority in its 17 months in office In 1986 Portugals economy grew four pct its current account surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs and inflation fell to 10 pct from 20 pct in 1985 Analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instability were worrying but they felt the foundations for continued growth had not been badly shaken The economy has developed a certain self-confidence that is now less dependent on the political situation said Fritz Haser economics professor at Universidade Livre Lisbon The market doesnt see this as a real crisis yet economist Jorge Braga de Macedo told Reuters Businessmen have identified political instability over the last 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lasting economic progress The PSD administration was the 16th formed since the 1974 revolution Portugals developing stock markets however remain buoyant Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surge in economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largely underpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank of Portugal forecast released on the day the PSD government fell predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growth would remain at similar levels this year But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policies and could slow economic development Soares who is expected to announce a decision by the end of the month can either call early elections or form a new government from parties in the existing left wing-dominated parliament Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quick elections as the best solution There is a good chance that a majority government could result from early elections Confederation of Portuguese Industry CIP president Pedro Ferraz da Costa said He said they were optimistic this could mean the continuation in the near future of liberalisation policies introduced over the last year The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution but the PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion polls say they could win an overall majority A PSD majority would also open the way for more wide-ranging reforms such as relaxation of labour laws and possible denationalisation of industry the analysts said Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition parties of blocking key economic reforms The left-wingers said Portugals positive economic results were more the product of favourable international conditions such as cheaper oil and raw material imports than of PSD policies
16759	South Korea has decided on major changes in its trade investment and finance policies aimed at reducing the growth of its balance of payments surplus and avoiding a trade war with the United States Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn-je said Kim told reporters the excessively fast rise in exports could make South Korea too reliant on exports increase 127nflation and produce trade friction The policy shift which means abandoning Seouls goal of rapidly reducing its foreign debt was worked out at a series of ministerial meetings Kim who is also Economic Planning Minister said the current account surplus previously expected to exceed eight billion dlrs this year would be held at about five billion dlrs by increasing imports accelerating market liberalisation and rationalising exports He said Seoul would try to limit its current account surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next few years although trade volume would continue to grow This will gradually reduce the ratio of the surplus to GNP gross national product from the current five pct level to three pct by 1991 he added Koo Bon-yong an aide to Kim said South Koreas foreign debt had been expected to fall below 40 billion dlrs by the end of 1987 against the initial forecast of 418 billion and 445 billion dlrs at end-1986 But now with the policy changes the debt is expected to remain above 40 billion dlrs although it could still be lower than the originally projected 418 billion dlrs he said The policy change was announced two days before the scheduled arrival of US Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige for talks with Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae South Korea is under US Pressure to reduce its bilateral trade surplus which rose to 74 billion dlrs last year from 43 billion dlrs in 1985 Kim said the policy changes were also prompted by the swing in South Koreas current account to a surplus of 206 billion dlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from a deficit of 438 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period First quarter 1987 exports rose 36 pct to 94 billion dlrs The government would make foreign currency loans worth 25 billion dlrs to firms willing to import capital goods raw materials and equipment preferably from the US He said The foreign currency-based loans which carry interest at 15 points above LIBOR London Interbank Offered Rate are considerable incentives given to increase imports Koo said Koo said the loans would be repayable in foreign currency It means they could become interest-free loans if the Korean currency continues to rise in value he said He said the South Korean won would be revalued against the dollar gradually but added We do not believe in rapid one-shot changes in the value of the won The won fixed at 83970 to the dollar today has risen six pct against the dollar since the beginning of 1986

18985	West German economic growth will slow to 15 pct this year from 24 pct in 1986 due to weak domestic demand and tougher competition from abroad the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD said in its semi-annual review of the world economy This view is less favourable than the West German governments forecast of a growth rate of under two pct this year but is in line with forecasts by independent economic institutes of growth ranging from 15 to two pct The OECD said that the economy should pick up next year with the gross national product rising by two pct in real terms The OECD said it assumed the German economy was passing through a period of temporary weakness and there would be some recovery in business confidence in the near future But it warned that the key to an improvement in the economy was higher domestic demand which is only forecast to rise by 25 pct this year and 275 pct in 1988 below 1986s 37 pct While noting that the government is bringing forward a five billion mark tax reform to January 1988 the OECD said that the medium to longer-term performance of the West German economy could be improved by reduction of subsidies - which would allow relatively lower tax rates Since the OECD report was compiled the West German Federal Statistics Office has released figures showing that the GNP actually fell 05 pct in real terms in the first quarter of this year compared with the final three months of 1986 Diplomatic sources here said that West Germany appeared likely to finish the year with the lowest growth rate of any of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations West Germanys current account surplus the target of considerable criticism by the Reagan administration is expected to rise slightly to 37 billion dlrs this year from 358 billion in 1986 before declining to 29 billion dlrs in 1988
18991	Japans trade surplus is likely to continue to grow in 1987 as sales of Japanese goods abroad increase while domestic demand remains sluggish the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD said In its latest half-yearly review of the world economy the OECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last year when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 while export markets rose by only two pct But it said this differential between the growth of domestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988 thus weakening the international adjustment process It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over two pct but with a rise in exports of 33 pct in 1987 and 36 pct in 1988 As a result the current account surplus in 1987 will rise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986 although in 1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6000 billion yen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand and increase imports to Japan However OECD officials said the measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand quite possibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects have worked through and thus will provide some stimulus to imports The OECD outlook said Continued large current account surpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantial net external asset position could well lead to upward pressure on the yen It said that further appreciation could then lead manufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus weaken domestic growth The OECD said Japans Gross National Product was likely to gorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988 below 1986s 25 pct growth But it said Japan would continue its good performance on inflation with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a 06 pct rise in consumer prices last year
18996	The United States should take urgent action to cut its crippling budget deficit including possible reductions in non-defense spending higher taxes and curbs on growth of the defense budget the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said The OECD in its semi-annual review of the world economy said a failure of the Reagan Administration and Congress quickly to agree on measures to cut the deficit could seriously affect confidence both in the United States and elsewhere It predicted that the federal deficit in fiscal 1987 running until September 30 this year would substantially overshoot both the Balanced Budget Acts target of 144 billion dlrs and official US Estimates in February of 175 billion The OECD projection which is based on assumptions of slower growth higher interest rates and actual data for the first half of the financial year is for a deficit of about 190 billion dollars it said While this would be 30 billion lower than last years deficit much of the improvement would be due to corporate tax increases being introduced before income tax cuts take effect The US Economic growth rate is expected to edge up to 275 pct next year from 25 pct this year and last In contrast to the last two years more competitive exports boosted by the fall in the dollar should help GNP growth Unemployment should continue to fall slowly as the service sector continues to create jobs But inflation appears to be heading higher partly due to the lower dollar with consumer prices forecast to rise four pct this year and 45 pct next year after just 21 pct in 1986 Monetary and fiscal policy appear to be the key factors behind the avoidance of recession the report said The current account balance of payments deficit is expected to be still around a high 125 billion dlrs next year after hitting a projected record 14725 billion this year it said In Canada economic growth is expected to pick up slightly to around 275 pct in 1988 from 25 pct this year but will still be below levels seen in recent years Inflation is expected to slow to 35 pct next year from 375 pct this year unemployment should edge down to nine pct in 1988 from 925 pct this year Canadas current account deficit is projected to shrink to around four billion US Dlrs this year and to remain at about that level in 1988
19005	Australias economy should manage modest growth over the next two years after a sharp slowdown but unemployment could still edge upwards the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD said The organisations latest half-yearly report says Gross Domestic Product will grow by 25 pct this year and by 275 pct in 1988 compared with only 14 pct in 1986 The growth will be helped by higher stockbuilding and stronger domestic demand following tax cuts and higher real wages it added The report forecasts a decline in inflation with consumer prices increasing by 85 pct this year and 625 pct in 1988 The current account deficit shows signs of easing slightly and could narrow to 12 billion dlrs by the end of 1988 While predicting slightly stronger growth than last year however the report revises downwards the OECDs earlier growth forecast for 1987 of 375 pct The OECD predicts a similar combination of modest economic growth and rising unemployment for New Zealand which is struggling to recover from a major economic crisis The countrys GDP which contracted by 06 pct last year should again show growth over the next two years rising by 025 pct this year and a more substantial 275 pct in 1988
19061	Japan could avoid a sharp rise in the value of the yen against the dollar if Japan the US And other nations succeeded in restructuring their economies an advisory panel to the governments Economic Planning Agency EPA said The advisory body said in its report that the yen would soar against the dollar if structural adjustments on a global basis were delayed An EPA official told Reuters the dollar could fall to slightly below 100 yen by 1993 if Japan and the US Failed to restructure their economies The dollars fall without structural adjustments would cut Japans current account surplus to two pct of gross national product GNP in 1993 the report said It said such a change would slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annually during the seven-year period to 1993 If the two nations restructured their economies the dollar would remain stable in real terms while reducing Japans current-account surplus to 21 pct of GNP in 1993 This scenario put Japans GNP growth at 35 pct a year It forecast real growth of three pct for the world economy and four pct for Japan by 2000 if the adjustments were made

19444	Italys Foreign Trade Minister Mario Sarcinelli commenting on speculation in the Italian press said a sharp balance of payments deficit in May could not be attributed to recent moves liberalizing the purchase of foreign securities Sarcinelli was reacting to suggestions that last months overall 3211 billion lire deficit which compares with Aprils 2040 billion surplus could be linked to a May 13 decree abolishing obligatory non-interest-bearing deposits on foreign securities purchases The deficit can be better attributed to premature and delayed foreign trade payments and receipts leads and lags rather than capital outflow to portfolio investment Sarcinelli said in a statement Earlier today the newspaper La Repubblica cited remarks by the Bank of Italy which announced the deficit for May and said it had been partly caused by non-banking capital outflows In practice it seems that there has been a constant flow of capital to foreign securities or investments outside our borders said the newspaper But the newspaper added that it was still not possible to say how far the move to abolish foreign securities purchase deposits had affected Italys balance of payments

14858	Japans Agriculture Ministry angered by US Demands that Japan open its farm products market will tell US Officials at talks later this month that liberalisation would harm existing US Farm exports to Japan a senior ministry official said Imports from the US Would drop due to active sales drives by other suppliers the official who declined to be named said Japan is the largest customer for US Farm products and it is not reasonable for the US To demand Japan liberalise its farm import market he said Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the US Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open its wheat market where volume and origin are regulated to protect local farmers Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat exports as they are more competitive than the US He said End-users would also buy other origins grain traders said US Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who is due to visit Japan for talks between April 16-27 has said he will ask Japan to offer a share of its rice market to US Suppliers and remove quotas on US Beef and citrus imports Other countries are already cutting into the US Market share here Australia the largest beef supplier to Japan has been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year beef accord next March 31 Imports of US Corn have fallen due to increased sales from China and South America while Japanese soybean imports from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year although the US Will remain the largest supplier US Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its beef imports since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain imports mainly from the US Japanese officials said An indication of the US Position came last December when Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to US Agricultural exports with the beef market alone representing some one billion dlrs in new business The US Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import controls on 12 other farm products including fruit juices purees and pulp tomato juice ketchup and sauce peanuts prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans To help calm heated trade relations with the US Japans top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove residual import restrictions on agricultural products But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional reaction and the senior ministry official said the farm issue should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the industrial sector Japan is the largest buyer of US Farm products and these issues should not be discussed on the same table the official said
15254	The US meat and poultry inspection programs are incapable of protecting consumers from contaminated products groups representing inspectors and consumers charged The whole trend of inspection for the last 10 years has been to corrupt and to degrade the system where today the public is at constant risk to contaminated and adulterated meat Kenneth Blaylock president of the American Federation of Government Employees told a House Agriculture subcommittee The American consumer has little reason to feel confident about the safety of meat and poultry being offered to him today said Rodney Leonard executive director of the Community Nutrition Institute Company management is less concerned about the risk to health than about raising plant output and company profits Leonard told a hearing of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Livestock Dairy and Poultry Kenneth Morrison staff associate at the Government Accountability Project said inspectors consistently disclose violations of federal law demonstrating a serious breakdown in the entire inspection system Morrison told of chicken fat for flavoring being contaminated by intestines dragging in a water trough used to flush away the condemned product fecal material human spit chewing gum and paper towels used by plant employees to blow their noses Donald Houston administrator of the US Agriculture Departments Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS defended the governments program calling it one of the most respected public health programs in the world FSIS inspects an estimated 127 mln head of cattle and 45 billion chicken and turkeys every year Houston said inspection programs have kept pace with change but conceded that the danger of chemical residues in the meat and poultry supply has increased He also said that although he was confident the bacterium salmonella eventually could be eradicated it would take time and much money to contain the growing problem Salmonella which in extreme cases can cause death is found in approximately 37 pct of US broilers 12 pct of raw pork and three to five pct of raw beef Houston said The number of reported cases has doubled over the past 20 years he said to 40000 cases annually We certainly really have not found an effective means of turning this disease around said Rep James Olin D-Va The National Research Council recommended in 1985 that FSIS intensify efforts to develop rapid diagnostic procedures for detecting microoganisms But the meat and poultry industries have said such controls would cost too much Hopefully we will not overreact by installing unnecessarily complicated procedures that may become obstacles to the real goal of providing an increasingly safer more nutritious and economical meat supply for consumers Stanley Emerling executive vice president of the National Association of Meat Purveyors said Blaylock speaking on behalf of food inspectors said a new program allowing elimination of USDA inspection functions at certain plants voids the law in letter and spirit and must be repealed or we will see rising consumer fraud and an epidemic of death and illness for which there will be no prevention nor legal recourse Subcommittee Chairman Charles Stenholm D-Tex said the panel would hold a hearing on salmonella June 2

15798	Zimbabwes beef exports to the European Community EC potentially worth 70 mln Zimbabwean dlrs this year may be jeopardised by an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in southwestern Matabeleland industry sources said The country has temporarily suspended beef exports to the EC because of the outbreak and awaits a decision from the EC veterinary committee which is considering a formal ban The outbreak in the countrys main ranching province has already led neighbouring beef-producing Botswana and Zambia to bar beef and dairy imports from Zimbabwe threatening the dairy industry with a loss of at least one mln dlrs in export revenue The situation is still uncertain at the moment Normally when an outbreak occurs there is an automatic suspension of beef exports one industry source said yesterday Commenting on EC policy he explained Depending on the seriousness of the outbreak the veterinary committee then decides on three options allowing us to continue exporting beef from disease-free areas clamping a three-month suspension on exports or banning us from exporting for a year We are still awaiting their decision he added asking not to be identified Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8100 tonnes of high-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country had spent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences and upgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports the country will be forced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at low prices the source said Projected earnings from beef sales could fall about 23 mln dlrs as a result he said

16564	US officials said they held out little hope the European Community EC would withdraw a controversial meat inspection requirement due to go into effect April 30 and which US meat producers claim will cut off their exports But the officials said they expect the EC to allow US plants to continue shipping meat through the end of the year provided they submit a plant improvement program with the US Agriculture Department The ECs so-called Third Country Meat Directive will require foreign meat processing plants to comply fully with EC inspection standards beginning April 30 The US meat industry has prepared a petition requesting the Reagan administration to retaliate against the EC rule At issue are US meat exports to the EC valued at 132 mln dlrs in 1985 The EC rule would require all US plants to make changes in their inspection methods ranging from veterinary staffing to use of wood Last December the EC determined that only one US cattle one hog and one sheep slaughtering facility could be approved without further review USDA would have to certify that the plants had corrected the deficiencies All remaining plants with a history or potential of shipping to the EC -- totaling nearly 400 -- would require more significant changes in plant constructions or procedures before further EC review Robert Hibbert general counsel for the American Meat Institute said the meat industry expected to submit a formal trade retaliation petition by April 30 An interagency committee is reviewing the industrys draft petition An official at the US Trade Representatives Office said US officials continued to press the EC to withdraw the rule but that the chances of that are not too good at this time However there is the expectation in US government and meat industry circles that the EC will continue to allow shipments at least through the end of the calendar year from US plants that submit to USDA a plan on how they will bring their operations into conformity with the EC regulation the USTR official said
16784	US Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng opens talks with Japanese government officials today well aware his demand for the opening of Japanese rice beef and citrus markets is likely to be rejected But in an interview with Reuters during the flight to Tokyo yesterday Lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw an international spotlight on Japans agricultural import protection in the hope pressure would build on Tokyo to open its markets The Japanese have said they are happy we are coming but they are not going to give us anything Lyng said US Officials do not expect any Japanese concessions during Lyngs two-week visit here Any farm trade concessions would be unveiled later this month they said If there is anything of consequence to offer Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone would take it with him when he visits Washington later in the month one US Official said Lyng plans to ask Japan to open the door to rice imports by partially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases A private US Rice trader visited Tokyo last week requesting Japan buy 200000 tonnes of rice for industrial uses such as making sake Japan has rejected the overture saying Tokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota for beef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers would like to buy much more beef than currently allowed He cited the example of a California company which transports live US Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter to circumvent the beef quota The cost of transport is higher than the value of the animal he said US Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry Promotion Corporation which regulates beef imports was forced to borrow from the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986 quota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising Japan has said it cannot open its markets to beef imports Along with beef the US Will also press Japan to eliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice by April 1988 Some US Officials believe Japan may eventually be willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges because liberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanese mandarin orange industry The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate because imports might replace domestic produced juice US And Japanese officials have said Lyng has resurrected a past US Proposal that Japan buy surplus US Foodgrains for donation to developing countries but some US Officials are skeptical action will be taken Lyng will also urge Japan to put its domestic farm policies including rice on the negotiating table during GATT talks in Geneva He said Japan must eliminate import quotas on certain minor food products or face possible US Reprisals
18034	A representative of the poultry industry said statistics showed that chicken is less frequently the cause of salmonella poisoning than beef dairy products or salads and other mixed foods Kenneth May President of Holly Farms Poultry Industries and a director of the National Broiler Council told a House Agriculture subcommittee the incidence of salmonella in chicken has not increased in recent years and that chicken is neither the major source of the bacterial poisoning nor the cause of an increase in outbreaks of the disease May said the Center for Disease Control figures showed that between 1978 and 1982 chicken was involved in four pct of all US salmonellosis outbreaks while beef accounted for ten pct of outbreaks and dairy products six pct May said the remaining outbreaks were caused by salads and mixed food turkey seafood pork eggs and other foods May said the chicken industry favored moving away from bird-by-bird inspection procedures to a risk assessment system better able to identify microbial and bacterial contamination of poultry However Ellen Haas executive director of Public Voice for Food and Health Policy said bird-by-bird inspection should be retained and labels should be attached to each ready-to-cook chicken to remind consumers about preparation procedures necessary to avoid illness Haas also called for a review of present chicken industry inspection methods that she said can worsen poultry hazards
18099	A former US Agriculture Department official urged the department to require that packages of chicken be labeled with handling and cooking instructions to protect the public from disease Carol Tucker Foreman President of Foreman and Heidepriem and a former assistant secretary of agriculture for food and consumer services told a House Agriculture subcommittee every hour of every day 22 Americans become victims of chicken contaminated with salmonella She said every two and a half weeks an American dies of salmonellosis or complications arising from it and the incidence of poisoning from poultry has increased steadily over the past several years Foreman said USDA should follow a National Academy of Sciences recommendation to label chicken packages to remind consumers of preparation procedures necessary to avoid illness She urged USDA to require that birds be washed thoroughly before they are defeathered and that defeathering machines be cleaned several times a day that birds be condemned if their intestines are punctured or there is visible fecal contamination and that chiller water be changed more often Kenneth Blaylock President of the American Federation of Government Employees said a poultry industry recommendation to move away from the current bird-by-bird inspection could prove disastrous He said a strengthened bird-by-bird inspection with slower line speeds was the foundation upon which new inspection techniques should be overlaid

20462	The United States is prepared to pull out all the stops to defend its agricultural trade rights under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade GATT US Ambassador to GATT Michael Samuels said Those rights are now being challenged by the European Communitys EC agricultural support policies he told a conference sponsored by the American Soybean Association He reiterated Washingtons firm intention to retaliate if the EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef without the issue being investigated by a GATT special committee The US claims the EC directive due to come into effect on January 1 threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of US meat shipments into the EC The US also will oppose all EC efforts to impair US trade via the EC oilseeds regime which supports EC oilseed prices over the current market level and which may be extended to include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax Samuels said Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral trade negotiations is meaningless if import barriers continue to be erected Samuels said Samuels called the US plan to eliminate world farm subsidies by the year 2000 proposed at GATT in July visionary and very serious  The EC and Japan have said it is unrealistic The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposal on farm trade reform expected to be tabled at GATT formally next week The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reduce tensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals substitutes dairy and sugar It also calls for reduction of farm subsidies The US Is not opposed to short-term measures as long as they are directly linked to long-term commitments to end major trade distortions Samuels said Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formally submitted and respond to it officially then We will consider its relation to the Punta del Este declaration to correct trade problems and expand market access the US Ambassador said The US can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignores the US plan when it tables its own proposal he added The key difference between the two approaches is that the US wants farm subsidies eliminated while the EC is pushing only for a reduction in farm suppports Samuels said If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze there would be little incentive for the Community to work to correct the international trade situation he added Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint the EC oilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports to third countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the US wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT

18604	European coffee traders and roasters may propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee Organization ICO coffee quotas at the end of their meeting here this week traders and officials told Reuters Although traders were unwilling to reveal details of the possible new formula they said it would give Brazil the worlds biggest coffee producer unchanged ICO quotas for the next two years and could be a basis for renegotiation The main sticking point on quotas has been Brazils attitude and this compromise could be a solution  one said However the European coffee trade federation meeting which began here today and is to continue to the end of the week has revealed gaps in the European position on re-introducing quotas Traders said that as a whole the trade side was against re-introduction of ICO quotas while roasters were generally in favour with the single proviso that there had to be some formula basis for re-allocating quota shares among producing countries The roasters said the positions were generally fairly close and problems with some Government officials Germany and Italy were cited as the extremes of polarized Government attitudes with most other countries on the fence Sources said Germany was the most extreme against quota re-introduction while the Italians were most in favour Nevertheless we expect to find enough common ground by the end of the week to at least present a common European Community EC view at the next meeting of consumer members of the International Coffee Agreement ICA in July one trader said We hope we can present the compromise proposal and that not only the consumer side but the producer side will accept it one official said We have learned that we can live without the quotas that were suspended in February last year but would prefer the stability they can bring to the market as long as we do not simply return to the old and outdated status quo as far as quota allocation is concerned he added Overall however trader and roaster opinion on the likelihood of a successful re-negotiation was mildly pessimistic varying between a 50-50 chance and 60-40 against Our main difficulty will be to persuade the US On the consumer side and Brazil on the producer side to agree to quota re-introduction  he said The US Position has if anything hardened while the new Brazilian Coffee Institute president has adopted the least negotiable position of any of his predecessors one trader said However with many producers starting to swing in favour of the consumer position that quotas have to be re-allocated under a new formula Brazil is becoming increasingly isolated which gives at least some hope of a compromise at the ICO quota meeting in September the official said

19318	European coffee roasters and traders have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee Organization ICO quotas Dutch Coffee Trade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said Van Horick who is a council member of the European Coffee Federation was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and would give Brazil the worlds biggest coffee producer an unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current coffee agreement van Horick said If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the ICO the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new agreement van Horick said Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in Brazil Although prices are now considerably lower consumers and producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the formula because it feared a lower quota But our proposal leaves it very little to object to van Horick said The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not reflect supply and demand reality he said Our formula builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost everyone Although full implications of the new formula have still to be worked out initial estimates suggest countries such as Colombia Kenya Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly higher quotas while others such as the Ivory Coast El Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share van Horick said Because the proposal provides that future quota distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply it should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing so would automatically prejudice their following years quota If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the September meeting most of whom are generally in favour of a new quota formula  van Horick said At the same time much will depend on Brazils attitude Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side If there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two months and most other producers favour our proposal we might just get an agreement van Horick added

20186	A voluntary compliance system for monitoring US coffee imports under quotas is viewed skeptically by many in the coffee industry said analysts and trade sources Many sectors of the trade including large roasters and importers are adamant against voluntary compliance because of the past which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it became a matter of the trade monitoring each other one analyst said On Monday a National Coffee Association newsletter said the Office of US Trade Representative will implement a voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to monitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill Under the arrangement milar to one in 1980 coffee importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the US government until Congress approves the monitoring authority but if coffee arrives without valid certification it will still be allowed entry While many believe producers will not seek to add to the overburdened stock situation in the US others believe some will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of monitoring controls trade sources said Last time there was a lot of false information submitted to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines a US Customs spokesman said Customs can do a good job when given the tools but when its hands are tied it doesnt have the authority to demand Form O documents tracking merchandise from source to destination he said Many see it as a true test of whether producers and importers will abide by the quota system It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the quota agreement said one major US roaster Last time we had a gentlemans agreement the trade did not act as a gentleman said another analyst adding without the need to submit documents the ball will be in the producers hands Some feel that importers will take advantage of the voluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-member countries at discounts and then bring it into the US falsely labelled According to customs officials several green coffee importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee fraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy beans If theres that much of a discrepancy between prices for one country and another producers may be teted to get rid of their stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and by circumventing the quota provisions said Paine Webber analyst Bernie Savaiko Still others believe that producers will not be hard pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in the US in the near term It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not have some share of connivance but I think the voluntary system seemed to suffice and coupled with the fact that we have so much coffee I dont think that it poses that much of a threat one trader said

17477	Philippine Coconut Authority PCA chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later this month to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community EC levy on vegetable oil imports I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is putting up this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countries like the Philippines Romero said in an interview He said he did not know how much support the levy had within the EC but he said he believed those originally opposed to the tax were under pressure to change their position Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany the Netherlands Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax But there was a danger some of them would be persuaded to change sides and if that happened opposition could crumble Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warning that copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained dangerous levels of aflatoxin a carcinogenic chemical He said the EC standard of 002 parts of aflatoxin per million parts of meal which EC countries had been asked to apply by October 1988 was too rigid He said Philippine copra cake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it is not properly dried or ground Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in London that the Philippines was doing its best to meet EC standards It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally but this was likely to take several years of research Copra meal exports were 817641 tonnes or 35 pct of total coconut exports in 1986 The meal was worth 735 mln dlrs Romero said he would also visit Oxford Universitys department of agricultural economics to discuss ways of avoiding the copra process altogether There are ways of producing coconut products outside of copra Romero said We can process fresh coconut without drying the meat in the sun Through the wet process we can process coconuts into other food or non-food products or we can go to the chemical root He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries to become more protectionist and he expected export prices of coconut products to drop In the long term we will be getting less and less for more and more production and Im not comfortable with that he said With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping up production of palm oil a coconut oil substitute palm oil output had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971 Romero said To add to that the US Soybean Association is spending billions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by saying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart he said Romero said he expected coconut product export prices to stay up for the rest of the year They would probably touch a high of 20 centspound from the current level of 1859 cents and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 1050 cents Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-year coconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall after two successive years of good harvests He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year to add to the production fall drought had affected output Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought the prices will start declining again The only sure way to keep prices stable is by processing adding more value he said Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by planting other cash crops between coconut trees he said A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on 10000 square metres of land Thats a lot of space Romero said He said the governments proposed land reform program would exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because they had less than the proposed seven-hectares of land If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels production and employment then it wont happen he said PCA figures show about one-third of the countrys population is dependent on the coconut industry Coconuts are planted on about 32 mln hectares or one-fourth of total agricultural land

15033	The Zambian government has no immediate plans to follow last weeks increase in the producer price of maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal an official of the ruling party said Last December a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for refined maize meal a Zambian staple led to food riots in which at least 15 people died That price increase which President Kenneth Kaunda later revoked followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund IMF to reduce the governments subsidy bill However if the producer price rise from 610 dlrs to 867 dlrs per 90-kg bag is not accompanied by a retail price increase the government will have to spend more on subsidies a practice discouraged by the IMF There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of meal It the government would have to choose between the demands of the IMF and those of the people a Ministry of Agriculture economist said
15043	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 198687 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April trade sources said They said sunflower maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm dry weather which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas However as showers fell intermittently after last weekend producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province 83 mm in Cordoba 41 in Santa Fe 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones 95 in Corrientes eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops including soybean However as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 21 mln to 23 mln tonnes against 22 mln to 24 mln forecast last week and down 439 to 488 pct on the 198586 record of 41 mln Area sown to sunflowers was two to 22 mln hectares 299 to 363 pct below the record 314 mln hectares last season Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 95 mln to 98 mln tonnes against 96 mln to 99 mln estimated previously This is 222 to 234 pct below the 124 mln to 126 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 198586 crop and 219 to 258 pct down on the official figure of 128 mln tonnes Maize was sown on 358 mln to 378 mln hectares two to seven pct down on last seasons 385 mln Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba Santa Fe and Chaco Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April The total area sown was 123 mln to 130 mln hectares 103 to 152 pct down on the 145 mln sown last season The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 29 mln to 32 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 33 mln forecast last week and is 238 to 293 pct down on last seasons 41 mln to 42 mln tonne crop The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted remaining at a record 75 mln to 77 mln tonnes up 42 to 55 pct on the 72 mln to 73 mln estimated by private sources for 198586 and 56 to 85 pct higher than the official figure of 71 mln The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 37 mln to 38 mln hectares 108 to 138 pct up on the record 334 mln sown in 198586 The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available Preparation of the fields for the 198788 wheat crop which will be sown between May and August or September has so far not been as intense as in previous years
15106	Storage problems with Brazils record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito speaking from Brasilia told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this years estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting but that most of it would stem from storage problems Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes theoretically sufficient for the crop But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed The states of Sao Paulo Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nations capacity but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions where rising production has outpaced storage capacity Brito said the Centre-West whose crops include soya and maize had between 30 and 40 pct of the nations grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space In addition to the poor distribution of storage units there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain Brito said Finally there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries

15686	Based on field travel in the Brazilian state of Parana soybean yields should be about average or 20 to 22 tonnes per hectare the US Agriculture Departments officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report The report dated March 24 noted Parana accounts for about 20 to 24 pct of Brazils total soybean crop It said generally favorable weather from early December through February helped compensate for earlier dryness However hot dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days followed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the second week of march has raised concern about late planted soybeans which are still immature but the impact may be localized the report said The corn crop is expected to be a record and will create serious storage problems the report said Due to favorable support prices corn area increased by more than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans and yields are expected to be above average it said Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn crop crop has been harvested During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grain elevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn the report said New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Parana accounts for about 60 pct of total production Major reasons for the decline are expected reduced government support price and good summer crop harvests
15720	The European Commission was authorised to buy up to one mln tonnes of maize into intervention stores in the second half of June although sales into intervention normally end on April 30 Commission sources said They said approval was given by the ECs Cereals Management Committee because of the possible disturbance of the market due to heavy imports of maize under the agreement between the EC and the United States The agreement guarantees access to the Spanish market for two mln tonnes of non-EC maize a year for the next four years The sources said the intervention price for the maize would be 20149 Ecus a tonne They said at this price it seemed unlikely that the full They added the decision is also designed to prevent massive offers of maize for intervention just ahead of the normal April 30 deadline which could be caused by speculation about the implementation of the accord with the United States

17503	The US Department of Agricultures forecast that French end-of-season soft wheat stocks will almost double in 198788 is premature but would not be surprising according to French cereal organisation officials The Cereals Intervention Board ONIC Wheat Producers Association and the National Union of Agricultural and Cereal Cooperatives have not yet forecast 198788 exports or end-of-season stocks However the officials said the USDAs figure of end 198788 stocks at 503 mln tonnes against 198687s 287 mln was not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April The French Feed Cereals Research Institute ITCF forecast in mid-April an average yield of 658 tonnes per hectare for soft wheat in 198788 compared with 56 tonnes in 198687 and the record high yield of 6566 tonnes in 1984 This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around 31 mln tonnes against 255 mln in 198687 given a Ministry of Agriculture estimate of area planted of 466 mln hectares against 461 mln in 198687 ONICs first preliminary forecast of the 198788 campaign will be released at the beginning of September an ONIC official said Soft wheat exports in 198788 were extremely difficult to estimate at this stage both within the European Community and to non-EC countries an ONIC official said He said however that among countries to which France could increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghreb countries Morocco Algeria and Tunisia he said The USDAs forecast of an 1165 mln tonne maize crop in 198788 against 1148 mln in 198687 while again premature was not out of line with estimates of the French Maize Producers Association AGPM an AGPM official said Maize plantings would be down in 198788 but yields were expected to be higher the AGPM official said It estimated 198788 maize plantings of 173 mln hectares down seven pct from the 187 mln hectares planted in 198687
17509	The Zambian government today announced minor price cuts for essential commodities as part of its new economic strategy while police and troops patrolled the northern Copperbelt to prevent any outbreaks of rioting However staple foods such as bread sugar and maize meal were not affected by the cuts and many people said this could provoke trouble from disgruntled elements who had expected more sweeping reductions Observers in the capital expressed disillusionment with the small extent of the price cuts which ranged up to 10 pct on items such as blankets soap detergents and baby food Residents in the Copperbelt contacted by telephone said government forces had set up roadblocks around the main towns In Lusaka business went on as usual and there was no sign of troops or police reinforcements on the streets President Kaunda had ordered the price reductions to take account of lower import costs following the revaluation of the kwacha to a fixed rate of eight per dlr from 21 on May 1 The revaluation formed part of a new go-it-alone economic strategy which Kaunda adopted to replace Zambias IMF austerity program Labour leaders in the Copperbelt said last week gangs of unemployed youths were being formed in the politically volatile region to take action against shops that did not reduce their prices after todays deadline Fifteen people were killed in the Copperbelt during food riots last December after the government tried to lift maize subsidies
18035	The House Agriculture Committee voted to make approximately 28 billion dlrs of feedgrains deficiency payments immediately instead of in the late fall A similar measure was decisively defeated on the Senate floor last week The bill which passed by a voice vote would allow so-called Findley payments to be made immediately rather than late this year Payments for 1987-90 feedgrains crops would not be changed Because the bill would move 28 billion dlrs of spending into fiscal 1987 from fiscal 1988 the measure is expected to meet stiff resistance in the full House
18482	Japanese compound feed output rose 23 pct to 2580 mln tonnes in 198687 ended March 31 from 2523 mln a year earlier the Agriculture Ministry said The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand for poultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beef cattle raising Ministry officials said Compound feed sales totalled 2601 mln tonnes in 198687 against 2540 mln a year ago while end-March stocks were 217554 tonnes against 224101 Corn use in feed output in 198687 rose to 1171 mln tonnes from 1102 mln a year earlier due to low import prices The officials said corn imports rose because the world surplus and the yens strength against the dollar reduced Chicago prices The corn compounding ratio rose to 452 pct in 198687 from 434 pct a year earlier Sorghum use rose marginally to 480 mln tonnes in 198687 from 479 mln but the compounding ratio fell to 185 pct from 189 pct because of greater corn use Higher import prices due to poor harvests last year in major producing nations such as Argentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum Soybean meal use fell to 258 mln tonnes from 263 mln and the compounding ratio declined to 100 pct from 103 pct The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted from increased use of cheaper rapeseed meal the officials said Rapeseed consumption in 198687 was 563889 tonnes against 528152 a year earlier The compounding ratio rose to 22 pct from 21 pct
18614	US House and Senate budget negotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reached yesterday to cut 125 billion dlrs from fiscal 1988 spending on agricultural programs Congressional sources told Reuters The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 14 billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House The negotiators also agreed to cut 16 billion from the farm budget in fiscal 1989 and 245 billion in 1990 for a total of 53 billion in saving over three years sources said The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculture committees with difficult choices on how to make changes in agriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targets without jeopardizing popular support payments senior Congressional aides told Reuters Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to find the budget savings Rep Dan Glickman D-Kan Chairman of the House grains subcommittee has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat and corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 228 dlrs and 192 dlrs respectively saying it would save 500 mln dlrs House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza has said the committee will consider the Glickman proposal But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to be approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers and a strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who said freezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major grain export competitors and would not achieve the budget savings Glickman claims Another area where Glickman and other have said budget savings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program ARP levels for wheat and corn However on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong stand within the Reagan administration arguing that the 1988 crop wheat acreage reduction should be left at 275 pct and not 30 pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget OMB Most commodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail Congressional sources said the only way to achieve significant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boost the 1988 corn ARP But one informed Congressional source said singling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen as unfair to one commodity Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is most likely to eventually look for budget savings are some tightening of the payment limitation rules and possible adoption of a 092 program for the 1988 crops of major grains Those changes would achieve a portion of the 125 billion but not enough they said Ultimately Congressional sources said the agriculture committees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut on all Commodity Credit Corp payments to farmers including price support loans and deficiency payments similar to the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986 This idea has been suggested by the American Farm Bureau Federation AFBF as the fairest approach for all commodities

18973	Sen Tom Harkin D-Iowa defended his controversial mandatory supply control farm bill and said US farmers should be allowed to vote in a referendum whether they approve of the proposal The Harkin proposal would set loan rates of 517 dlrs per bushel for wheat 377 dlrs for corn and 932 dlrs for soybeans all to be put in effect under strict controls on planted acreage reductions Present loan rates are 228 dlrs for wheat 192 for corn and effectively 456 for soybeans Also under the plan the US would seek a world market sharing cartel with the European Community and other exporting nations to share-out export markets Harkin said during the first of several Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearings examining farm programs Harkin made the following claims in testimony on his Family Farm Act -- The mandatory control bill would increase farm income and reduce government spending on agriculture -- Harkin said his policy of high price supports would not ruin US agricultural exports as critics claim but would increase overall revenue from exports This would be done by seeking agreement among major exporting countries including the European Community on market sharing at agreed high prices Sen Christopher Bond R-Mo countered during the hearing that such a grain export cartel is not workable -- Harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supports would be passed onto consumers but he said high food prices stem more from gouging by food processing companies than from high farm product prices Harkin cited what he termed excessive net returns on equity over five years of 334 pct at Kellogg 319 pct Monfort 228 pct Nabisco 228 pct ConAgra 212 pct HJ Heinz 191 pct Ralston Purina 172 pct Pillsbury and 167 pct Quaker Oats -- Harkin said a legitimate concern about his bill would be the impact of higher prices on livestock producers He said as a transition to the higher prices he would allow livestock producers to purchase Commodity Credit Corp grain stocks for three years Thereafter livestock farmers would benefit from a predictable and stable grain price he said -- Harkin said that under his policy approach farm participation would be no more mandatory than the current farm program He said farmers now must participate in farm programs in order to receive credit for planting and to protect farm income
19165	Ghana has lifted a ban on rice and maize imports due to crop problems caused by unusually dry weather the official Ghana News Agency GNA reported today Secretary for Finance and Economic Planning Kwesi Botchwey made the announcement last night while accepting 7891 tonnes of rice worth about four mln dlrs under a Japanese food aid programme The lifting of the ban imposed earlier this year follows government concern over lower than average rainfall in southern Ghana and its implications for the major harvest Botchwey said rain has been lacking in major cereal growing areas throughout the south this year The Ministry of Agriculture has predicted a fall of at least 25 pct in all major staple crops including maize rice and cassava GNA quoted Botchwey as saying that while the consequences of current reduced rainfall will be nowhere near the drought experiences of 198283 the government has taken steps to alleviate anticipated food production shortfalls The failure of seasonal rains has already seriously affected drinking water supplies farming and fishing in parts of the Central and Volta regions of Ghana where rivers have dried up
19721	Weekend rain over the Western Corn Belt brought further relief to crop areas that had been dry earlier this month and developing weather patterns will bring welcome moisture to central and eastern belt locations this week according to Dale Mohler senior meteorologist for Accu-Weather Inc There is going to be more rain for the next two three days he said Were in a fairly wet pattern with normal to above normal moisture this week Mohler said rainfall averaged 12 inch across southern Minnesota 34 inch over southwest Iowa one inch in eastern Nebraska and 1-12 inches in south-central Nebraska Illinois fields saw virtually no rain over the weekend but were receiving scattered thundershower activity today he said Rain patterns will move across Indiana to Ohio with thudershower activity yielding to more general rains he said Tomorrow that eastern area will get 14 to one inch a pretty good rain Mohler said Rain was heavier than expected over the weekend sparking an early selloff in soybean futures at the Chicago Board of Trade Prices were off 14 to 20-12 cents with November off 19-12 cents at 543-12 dlrs Mohler said the cold front now over the eastern belt is expected to move over the central Midwest then move north later in the week That could bring new rain patterns across the Corn Belt and assure good crop conditions as early-developed corn moves into the crucial pollination stage in early July he said

16009	Commodities from gold to grains to cotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as losses in the US dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears of inflation and economic instability Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in New York where gold jumped 1240 dlrs and closed at 43650 dlrs a troy ounce and silver 225 cents to 686 dlrs a troy ounce A key factor behind the advance was anticipation that inflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations to halt the slide in the value of the US dollar said Steve Chronowitz director of commodity research with Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co in New York The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from the seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their commitment to support its value and despite reports of intervention by the US Federal Reserve Bank traders said Traders said it appears that the industrial nations known as the Group of Seven lack the ability to change the long-term direction of the currency markets Maybe they have some ideas or plans said Chronowitz If they do its not evident It looks like theres no cure but to let the free market take values to where they should be One way or another we will force our major trading partners to stimulate their economies as a measure to correct the mounting US trade deficit Chronowitz said I think the markets believe and have believed for a long time that the only recourse is to reflate at some point Its going to be a long and tedious process but thats whats happening he said The falling value of the dollar makes US commodities cheaper for foreign buyers stimulating demand At the same time traders who are holding stocks and bonds saw the value of their investments falling and many are turning to commodities such as precious metals as a hedge said Marty McNeill a metals analyst in New York with the trading house of Dominick and Dominick The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout the commodities markets as grains livestock and cotton posted broad gains Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in the grain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome supplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulate export demand After the close of trading the Agriculture Department raised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union by two mln tonnes from the month-earlier report Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange while live cattle were moderately higher Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices They said hogs havent been making the weight gains that are normal at this time of year and farmers have been too busy with field work to market animals

18873	The West Texas cotton crop was largely unscathed by an isolated thunderstorm in that region last night that packed hurricane-force winds crop and weather experts said There might have been some isolated storms but certainly nothing damaging said Charles Stichler an extension agronomist with the Agricultural Extension Service in far West Texas Rumors of a damaging storm in West Texas helped the New York cotton futures market rally sharply this morning Cotton for December delivery was 135 cents higher at 7095 cents a lb at midsession after peaking this morning at 7125 cents What happened is that the storm hit Lubbock airport and when that happens everybody sees it said Dale Mohler a senior meteorologist with Accu-Weather Inc Lubbock is the heart of the West Texas cotton region which produces about 80 pct of that states crop The storm produced winds of about 75 mph Thats hurricane force But they were isolated to just a small portion of the West Texas area probably less than five pct Mohler said No doubt there was some damage But if it had hit in July or August when fruiting would be underway it would have been worse Mohler said About 60 pct of the West Texas cotton crop has been planted and the remainder could be done by the weekend if weather remains hot and dry Stichler said The temperature in West Texas since mid-week has been about 95 degrees But a hot spell was sorely needed after far heavier than normal rainfall for several weeks he said

19672	The Reserve Bank of India RBI announced new rules to allow exporters of 25 products to use foreign exchange up to 10 pct of their firms total annual export earnings for export promotion abroad The move is designed by the government to improve Indias trade deficit Products eligible for the new Blanket Exchange Permit Scheme include tea bags cigarettes coffee leather various textiles chemicals pharmaceuticals plastics engineering and electronic goods ready-made garments processed food sports goods fabricated mica and consultancy services The scheme replaces current rules which allow different amounts of foreign exchange to be used only when firms attain a minimum annual turnover prescribed for each product RBI said under the new rule 16 other products will qualify on a discretionary basis for overseas promotional spending of not more than two pct of the freight-on-board value of annual export earnings These include oil cakes cereals raw cotton raw and semi-processed leather gems castor and sandalwood oil psyllium husks and seeds opium and various mineral ores RBI said exporters of products not covered by either of the two groups will be eligible to use up to five pct of their freight-on-board value of their annual export earnings Industry sources said the new entitlements considerably higher than the previous limits are also more flexible because holders of new permits no longer need to frequently apply to RBI for release of foreign exchange for export purposes
19835	The Pakistani government allowed the private sector to export cotton and rice in a new trade policy announced to cover the next three years Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a televised speech it was also decided to allow duty-free import of cotton yarn Cotton and rice are Pakistans main exports which have been handled exclusively by state corporations since early 1970s Haq said now the private sector would export cotton and rice along with the state corporations He said duty-free import of cotton yarn was allowed to make high quality yarn available to local ancillary industries and to enable them to compete effectively in the world market This would help overcome domestic shortages of yarn he said
19947	Pakistani government allowed freer cotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimed at narrowing the countrys yawning trade gap Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a televised speech the government had also decided to allow duty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industry more competitive and to link bulk tea imports to the export of Pakistani products Cotton and rice are Pakistans main exports which have been handled exclusively by state corporations since early 1970s But Haq said now the private sector would also export cotton and rice along with the corporations which meets a long-standing demand of the local traders The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed to bring down prices and help the local ancillary industries compete effectively in the world market he said Haq said the new policy effective from the fiscal year 198788 beginning on July 1 would be for three years but reviewed every year It was a departure from the previous practice of announcing trade policies for a single fiscal year and Haq said it would enable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over a longer period He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been provided for the export of engineering goods to selected third world countries on soft credit terms Pakistans 198687 exports at 36 billion dlrs 182 per cent more than in the previous year and imports at 523 billion dlrs compared to 563 billion dlrs in 198586 He said the government policy was to rationalise and streamline import controls It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports specially on raw materials and intermediate goods local industry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs he said Prices have been on the increase and quality of goods produced has been low This restrictive policy also gave rise to smuggling and hampering of exports He said that to correct this situation 136 items had freed from import restrictions Previously Pakistan has met its trade gap largely from remittances from its nationals working abroad mainly in the Gulf However the remittances have begun to fall after the drop in oil prices in recent years leading to the spectre of a balance of payments crisis for Pakistan

14891	Kuwaits oil-reliant and debt-ridden economy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices will determine the pace of recovery bankers and economists say Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to hold oil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the northern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens Bankers estimate the economy measured in terms of gross domestic product gdp shrank 19 pct in real terms last year after contracting 81 pct the year before This was after taking into account inflation in consumer prices of 15 pct in 1985 slowing to 10 pct in 1986 Factors depressing economic activity include the 6-12-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwaits doorstep which threatens the emirates vital oil export lifeline through the Gulf and has sapped business confidence But sentiment received a much-needed boost in September when after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis caused by the 1982 crash of local stock market a comprehensive new debt settlement program was introduced The share crash result of a speculative spree in forward trading left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default The cheques were also used as collateral for consumer spending thus generating an informal credit system Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are still owed by individuals and companies There was some 44 billion dinars about 157 billion dlrs in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986 of which one-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as bad or doubtful debt But the government has repeatedly said it will not allow any banks to go under The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of problem credit over 10 to 15 years depending on whether debtors have regular cash flows or not Banks shareholders and depositors will have their rights guaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance in a country of only 17 mln people where the financial sector is the biggest after oil Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride out the oil glut bankers and economists say Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948000 barrels per day bpd compared with production capacity of 40 mln bpd mentioned last year by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah But strategic diversification into downstream operations in Europe several years ago and a hefty refining investment at home gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell over one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average 200 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed product such as gas oil kerosene and naphtha rather than as crude Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason for cautious optimism Other reasons are low domestic inflation a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent years and signs government spending on productive sectors will remain steady External accounts are in good shape with an estimated 18 billion dinar current account surplus in 1986 16 pct below that for 1985 but still an achievement in the recession-hit Gulf Kuwaits petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put officially at over 80 billion dlrs earning investment income of the equivalent of about 365 billion dlrs a year But for the first time since the end of the oil boom these reserves may not be enough to prevent a real budget deficit for the 198687 fiscal year ending June 30 bankers say In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary revenues for 198687 were cut 386 pct and spending 11 pct doubling the nominal deficit to 133 billion dinars This left out income from state reserves usually excluded in official budget accounting which are forecast by bankers at up to 10 billion dinars in 198687 resulting in some shortfall Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for economic growth this year or next It depends on oil prices one said This summer is important Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sunday the cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state spending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the economy He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be spelled out in the 198788 budget possibly in June

16108	The government must announce harsh cuts in spending in its May 14 economic statement if it is to give an adequate response to Australias economic problems the ANZ Banking Group Ltd ltANZAS said Cuts of two billion dlrs would be insufficient against the backdrop of a 12 billion dlr government deficit and a 14 billion dlr current account deficit it said in its monthly Business Indicators publication For the past two years the government has struggled with an economic reality that demands measures beyond those which it sees as politically practicable it said The political climate meant there would be a continued over-reliance on monetary policy to hold the exchange rate and maintain confidence in economic management ANZ said The cost of this approach is that the much-needed revival of business investment will be further postponed it said The economy was now on a modest growth upswing boosted by export and import-replacement industries which had created a false suggestion that the worst adjustments to the balance of payments crisis were past Unfortunately successful adjustment to Australias deep-seated economic problems remains a long-term process it said In its economic forecasts ANZ said it expected moderate overall economic growth with gross domestic product GDP rising 27 pct this year and 24 pct in 1988 The current account deficit would narrow to five pct of GDP this year and 43 pct in 1988 and net foreign debt would grow strongly from 81 billion at the end of 1986 to 972 billion at end-1987 and 1103 billion a year later Inflation would fall to 85 pct in 1987 and 75 pct in 1988 from 89 pct in 1986 and further falls in real wages were expected ANZ said

16158	The five leading West German economic research institutes have failed to agree about how strongly the domestic economy will expand this year but revised down forecasts contained in a report published six months ago The three research groups of Kiel Hamburg and Essen predicted in the institutes joint spring report that gross national product GNP would rise by two pct in 1987 compared with 24 pct in 1986 The five institutes had jointly forecast three pct 1987 growth in October last year Taking a dissenting view the DIW institute of West Berlin and Munichs Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth The joint report said that the estimates of economic development made by the DIW and Ifo were markedly less favourable than those of the other three The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a slow start to the year In the second half of 1987 there will however only be a weak upward movement they said The two institutes said external economic factors which were currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would dominate the economic environment throughout the year They saw exports falling by a real 2-12 pct in 1987 and predicted no marked improvement in the course of the year The other three institutes however wrote The decline in demand and production seen in the winter months does not indicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate uncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans But they expected that many investments had not been cancelled but only put off It can be presumed that the braking actions on the economy will diminish markedly this year They added The domestic prerequisites for a continuation of the economic uptrend are still favourable These three institutes said diminishing external burdens combined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in demand and production could be expected by the spring However this projection was clouded by risks including the further development of the mark against the dollar Contrary to the DIW and Ifo the three institutes said that while exports would continue to be the weak point of the economy in 1987 there is good reason to believe that exports will soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during the course of the year They predicted an overall 05 pct fall in exports in 1987 the same as in 1986 The three more positive institutes saw private consumption rising by four pct in 1987 compared with 42 pct in 1986 while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase They saw the climate for equipment investment improving but predicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 46 pct in 1986 Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in unemployment The Kiel Hamburg and Essen institutes said the jobless total would average 217 mln in 1987 compared with 223 mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in work of about 200000 These three institutes said new jobs would be created mainly in the private services sector and also by the state in the context of job creation measures The construction industry was likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980 but they predicted either no rise in employment in the manufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur only in the tertiary sector while the number employed in the manufacturing industry will decline The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to 220 mln in 1987 from 223 mln in 1986 They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58 billion marks from 78 billion in 1986 The other three saw a current account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marks and predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around 100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986 The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start to rise in 1987 after they declined in 1986 and all five predicted an average increase over the year of 05 pct
16226	Portugals economy which has been enjoying one of its most buoyant periods in more than a decade may now be strong enough to shrug off the countrys latest government crisis analysts said But the April 3 ousting of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silvas government could slow economic reforms and investment as Portugal continues to adapt to membership in the European Community which it joined in January last year they said Cavaco Silvas minority Social Democratic Party PSD was toppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties The centre-right administration had made economic growth reform a priority in its 17 months in office In 1986 Portugals economy grew four pct its current account surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs and inflation fell to 10 pct from 20 pct in 1985 Analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instability were worrying but they felt the foundations for continued growth had not been badly shaken The economy has developed a certain self-confidence that is now less dependent on the political situation said Fritz Haser economics professor at Universidade Livre Lisbon The market doesnt see this as a real crisis yet economist Jorge Braga de Macedo told Reuters Businessmen have identified political instability over the last 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lasting economic progress The PSD administration was the 16th formed since the 1974 revolution Portugals developing stock markets however remain buoyant Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surge in economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largely underpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank of Portugal forecast released on the day the PSD government fell predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growth would remain at similar levels this year But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policies and could slow economic development Soares who is expected to announce a decision by the end of the month can either call early elections or form a new government from parties in the existing left wing-dominated parliament Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quick elections as the best solution There is a good chance that a majority government could result from early elections Confederation of Portuguese Industry CIP president Pedro Ferraz da Costa said He said they were optimistic this could mean the continuation in the near future of liberalisation policies introduced over the last year The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution but the PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion polls say they could win an overall majority A PSD majority would also open the way for more wide-ranging reforms such as relaxation of labour laws and possible denationalisation of industry the analysts said Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition parties of blocking key economic reforms The left-wingers said Portugals positive economic results were more the product of favourable international conditions such as cheaper oil and raw material imports than of PSD policies

16268	Four of West Germanys five leading economic research institutes warned that excessive monetary growth threatened a resurgence of inflation But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin echoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials said the expansion seen over the last 1-12 years did not necessarily threaten stability The five institutes issued a joint spring report in which three -- Kiel Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise in GNP in 1987 while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome in view of the slowdown in economic activity But experience has shown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a price rise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears may seem exaggerated they said But it has often turned out in the past that the price climate can quickly deteriorate forcing the central bank into a restrictive policy they said The economic costs of a preventive stability policy are less than fighting inflation once it has taken hold they said The four institutes disputed the view that monetary expansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domestic investors switch liquidity into longer term capital market investments following lower interest rates Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion of central bank money stock but do not automatically lead to a smaller expansion of money supply they said A return to growth and stability did not require spectacular central bank moves but could be done quietly with open market operations and repurchase pacts which would avoid an interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations The DIW institute said monetary policy should not be focused simply on growth of production potential Because of uncertainty about exchange rate developments and economic weakness other factors should be taken into account Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cuts and avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluation speculation Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threat in itself to price stability The 197981 inflation following strong 197778 money growth reflected other causes such as rising oil prices and the falling mark

16783	Consumer prices in the countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD rose 03 pct in February and inflation rose to 24 pct year-on-year the OECD said in a communique The OECD attributed the rise in consumer prices to the effects of the February 1986 drop in energy prices working their way out of the index The February increase was less than Janauarys 04 pct increase but slightly above the average for the later months of 1986 Inflation in the 24 western industrialised nations in January was a revised 19 pct year-on-year Retail energy prices rose by 03 pct less than Januarys 11 pct increase Energy prices for consumers were still nine pct lower than a year earlier it said Consumer prices excluding food and energy rose 03 pct in February in line with previous months although there has been some acceleration noticeable in the US And Britain Among the leading seven industrial countries consumer price inflation was highest in Italy at 42 pct followed by Canada at 40 pct Britain at 39 pct France at 34 pct the US At 21 pct and West Germany and Japan with negative rates of 05 pct and 14 pct respectively

17970	South Africa is expected to unveil tomorrow an expansionary budget for the second consecutive year in a bid to boost the nations flagging economic growth rate economic analysts said Faced with competing demands for increased military and police spending and the pressing need for more funds for black housing and education Finance Minister Barend Du Plessis is expected to raise significantly the governments overall expenditure targets when he presents the budget to parliament the analysts said Analysts expect Du Plessis to provide for a rise in state spending at least equal to the 16 pct inflation rate for the financial year that started on April 1 while ignoring pleas from the private sector to stimulate growth by cutting taxes Fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary but simply raising government spending and increasing the budget deficit is an inflationary form of stimulation said Rob Lee chief economist at South African Mutual Life Assurance Co South Africa this year is targeting inflation-adjusted growth in GDP of three pct against an increase last year of less than one pct Growth in GDP over the past decade has averaged about 15 pct while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled to over 30 pct Economists estimate that the governments spending target will rise to about 47 billion rand with revenue budgeted at around 40 billion rand This would leave a budget deficit before borrowing of about seven billion rand or four pct of GDP The government having consistently overshot its own spending targets for more than a decade also faces a credibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in the budget analysts said The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure said Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview Many analysts in the private sector are now paying less attention to the figures presented in the budget and are using their own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for the money and capital markets South African Mutuals Lee believes government spending will again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49 billion rand this year leaving a deficit of between 5 and 55 pct of GDP compared with a three pct limit suggested by the IMF The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned predicted one analyst noting that South Africa has moved steadily away from austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the past two years The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in the political situation and the onset of an economic crisis triggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll over loans to the country in September 1985 Against a background of Western economic sanctions falling per capita incomes rising joblessness and high inflation government officials say economic growth is the prime objective But private-sector economists caution that the governments ability to promote growth by boosting state spending is constrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on the current account of the countrys balance of payments Most of that surplus this year estimated at around 25 billion dlrs will be swallowed up by repayments on the nations estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of an arrangement reached earlier this year with major international creditor banks Within these constraints economists believe Du Plessis has little room to manoeuvre Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries and budgeted spending increases for the state-owned Post Office and South African Transport Services suggest that major tax concessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely Du Plessis earlier this year announced small concessions for taxpayers in a mini-budget before the May 6 whites-only election The poll delayed presentation of the national budget This will not be a very exciting budget commented Harry Schwarz spokesman on finance for the liberal Progressive Federal Party I do not expect any major tax cuts as all the sweets were given out before the election

18993	Economic growth will remain sluggish in the Netherlands and Belgium next year and unemployment may rise the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast Belgiums GDP growth may slow down to 15 pct this year and next year bringing a rise in the number of jobless the OECD said in its semi-annual survey Belgian inflation could stabilise at 15 to 20 pct while the current account surplus will probably remain large at about three pct of GDP While the Belgian government has made progress in trimming its borrowing requirement it will probably be insufficient to check the self-sustaining nature of the deficit the OECD said In the Netherlands real GDP growth will also slip to 15 pct this year and one pct in 1988 with Dutch exports becoming less competitive and imports rising Employment is forecast to decelerate as well reflecting more sluggish growth in the private sector and budgetary cuts the report said Dutch consumer prices are set to fall by 05 pct in 1987 and stay stable in 1988 partly as a result of declining domestic gas prices Luxembourgs economy by contrast will see slightly faster growth in GDP this year as a result of an upward movement in wages But real growth in consumption will ease next year

15063	Cheap oil feedstocks the weakened US dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined US petrochemical industry to record profits this year with growth expected through at least 1990 major company executives predicted This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp ltGAF privately-held Cain Chemical Inc and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc ltASH the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period said Paul Oreffice chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co ltDOW adding Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics are expected to buy quantities this year US petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year said John Dosher managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct he said Oreffice speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history In 1985 when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong US dollar Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it Oreffice said GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the US chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987 Last year the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs a 54 pct leap from 1985 The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning said Paces John Dosher Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies That helped boost US chemical exports Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s Finally virtually all major US chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts GAF which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp ltUK recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp ltBOR a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals Another industry powerhouse WR Grace ltGRA has divested its retailing restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities such as ethylene in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers Companies like DuPont ltDD and Monsanto Co ltMTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated Dosher said But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market Some top chemical executives share the concern The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes GAFs Heyman cautioned The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised Specialty businesses do not stay special long Houston-based Cain Chemical created this month by the Sterling investment banking group believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend Chairman Gordon Cain who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business has spent 11 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous high-margin business Cain said adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually Garo Armen an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum wood and steel products Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years provided the US economy continues its modest rate of growth

15939	The United States dependency on foreign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s according to John H Lichtblau president of Petroleum Industry Research Associates Lichtblau speaking at an alternative energy conference here said the US may depend on foreign suppliers for as much as 52 pct of its oil by 1995 surpasssing the previous high level of 47 pct in 1977 The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is inevitable Lichtblau said As much as 30 pct of US oil imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations he said Lichtblau said the US depended on foreign suppliers for 33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to 40 pct by 1990 However the rate of this growth can be affected positively or negatively through government action or inaction Lichtblau said He said that one of the governments negative actions is the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash flow for oil exploration Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices An international floor price adopted by all or most industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective measure and would be much less distortive for the US than if we imposed it alone Lichtblau said Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen US dependency on foreign oil Lichtblau said A potential for alternative supplies could limit the willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices he said Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer tax abatements for oil drilling to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans for alternative energy

18621	Some OPEC states are unhappy about the prices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose great problems when the group reviews its six-month-old price and output pact in Vienna next week oil analysts say They said Nigeria which holds the OPEC conference presidency and Qatar probably have the biggest grievances about price differentials making some of their crudes uncompetitive There has also been speculation by Japanese traders that OPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price differentials is unlikely so as to avoid giving the market signals of a dent in OPECs new unity All OPEC members can make a good case for changing differentials said one analyst with a major oil company But at the end of the day the attitude is going to be leave well alone and little or nothing is likely to be altered Iran Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw sales problems earlier this year traders say But diminished customer resistance to fixed prices and in some cases marketing incentives have helped their sales Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by means of discounts processing deals or selling them alongside better priced grades in a package Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced at least for some part of the year But many experts say OPEC should change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for fuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades At its last meeting in December OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed prices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference point Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985 when members offered discounts to attract customers OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 158 mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 166 mln for the third quarter and 183 mln for the fourth Analysts expect it will now extend or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not mirror official prices but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr target and at most make minimal changes to differentials analysts say The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one non-OPEC crudes OPEC assigned prices to its other key export crudes with a 265 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest Extra heavy crudes were among those left out Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil exports actually sold at official prices Several experts say only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at official prices with some of the rest included in processing or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year when some producers output fell due to customer reluctance to pay the new prices Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude -- now OPECs highest priced grade at 1892 dlrs a barrel --was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britains Brent In February and March Nigerias production shrank below its 1238 mln bpd OPEC quota Spot prices have since revived due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline and its output has risen Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel But Mehdi Varzi chief oil analyst with Londons Kleinwort Grieveson Securities doubts Nigeria will actively push the differentials question in Vienna It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria which holds the presidency raised the issue he said

17620	A cut of about half a percentage point in Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect although economists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank encouraged by a strong guildermark relationship and wide premiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German might lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first Last month the Central Bank lowered its special advances rate to 51 pct from 525 pct after the Bundesbank dropped its repurchase tender rate to 355 pct from 38 pct That rate has remained in force just holding above the five pct official secured loans rate which governs commercial bank borrowings Given a strong guilder a further fall in the West German repo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff forcing an official Dutch rate cut analysts said In February when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate to three pct from 35 pct the Central Bank only lowered money market rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loans rate on lending under its three month credit quota Since then however both the Central Bank and Finance Ministry have made it clear they favour lower official rates In April Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said he would follow any Bundesbank cut and last week the Finance Ministry expressed satisfaction when it raised 225 billion guilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 10010 pct for an effective yield of 598 pct the lowest since 1965 Technically analysts said there has to be a difference between the secured loans rate which applies to lending under the credit quota and the tariff on special advances which add extra liquidity to the money market Bank economists and dealers said a West German move to further lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts would result in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate provided the guildermark relationship permitted The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around its parity value within the European Monetary System of 112673 guilders per 100 marks Today foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10 guilder cents to 112705 guilders per 100 at the fix a level that would not permit a change in the interest rate differential between West Germany and the Netherlands dealers said An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German and Dutch interest rates to ease in the short term However he said new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation expectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates in the longer term In the Netherlands the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil or even negative while the latest official economic forecasts point to a falling rate of economic growth It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement negotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation the ABN economist said He said Dutch money supply growth which ran at 34 pct in January could also contribute to some inflation At Amro Bank a leading analyst said inflation could run to two pct next year The bank expects Dutch capital market rates currently averaging around 61 pct to stop easing in the second half of this year and stabilize around 56 pct Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying spree on the bond market which would bring yields down probably only temporarily while money rates could fall below five pct Currently all periods are traded at 512 to 525 pct in the money market

14931	Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German economic growth In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs here Poehl said It would be an extremely risky policy to aim for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit He said the United States could face a vicious circle of depreciation inflation and more depreciation if it took that route Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet US Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy accelerating tax cuts cutting interest rates and tolerating above-target money supply growth He said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to the beginning of this year but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the West German parliament But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could accept on exports from a rising mark he said Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about one-third of its gross national product so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home A further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth he said Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade had given some extra leeway But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct not the reported negative inflation rates last year and West Germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments For the time being we will have to focus our policy more on the external side and we can live with a more expansionary money supply But we must be very careful he said He said he shared some of the US Concern about Japans trade surpluses which affected European countries as well as the United States Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries saying the importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level and that further changes would damage growth he said This was a remarkable change in attitude especially on the part of our American colleagues he said But he said there was still a danger that the correction of the dollars value could overshoot
15212	The relatively high level of real US interest rates suggests that there is scope for further declines in money market rates but the Federal Reserve is unlikely to promote such a drop as long as the dollar remains volatile said JP Morgan and Co Inc chairman Lewis Preston He said in response to a reporters question after the banks annual meeting that money market rates could decline further but I dont think the Fed is going to encourage that as long as the exchange markets are as volatile as they are On the other hand he said that barring a collapse of the dollar he did not see rates going much higher He said that Morgans recent rise in its prime lending rate was purely a reflection of an increase in a whole spectrum of rates Preston reiterated earlier company forecasts that the US economy should show roughly 25 to three pct real growth this year He also said that as a consequence of the dollars decline and oil price rises inflation would rise moderately to a 35 to four pct rate in 1987

15549	The United States which has long sought Japanese action to stimulate its economy appears to be satisfied Tokyos latest package is a major development and allows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement to stabilize currencies Monetary sources said they believed that US Treasury Secretary James Baker considered Tokyos package announced yesterday to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy But yesterdays statement by seven leading industrial powers endorses the yens rise from around 153 to the dollar the level at the February 22 Paris Accord to about 145 today And the initial reaction of currency markets in the Far East demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced that currencies yet reflect economic fundamentals even though the countries appear to do so The yen sank below 145 at one point despite intervention by the Bank of Japan Kiichi Miyazawa Japans Finance Minister said the movement since Paris was consistent with currency trading ranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks I would say that what has happened to the yen in the past several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the discussions in Paris Miyazawa said yesterday The supplementary budget worth about 3448 billion dlrs was announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of Miyazawas departure for Washington to attend yesterdays meetings of leading industrial nations In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action extraordinary and urgent the meeting reaffirmed the Paris Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals or economic reality The Group of Seven -- the United States Japan West Germany France Britain Italy and Canada -- therefore repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to foster exchange rate stability The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central bank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the dollars fall While relatively unsuccessful the scale of intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent years Monetary sources also said they understood that Secretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely successful in the light of the Japanese announcement They also said there was a growing feeling among the finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over medium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term differences in past meetings West Germany whose currency has not risen anything like the yen since the Paris Agreement appears from the face of yesterdays statement to have won acceptance from other countries that its exchange rate is acceptable Bonns finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance between West Germany and Japans trade surpluses and Americas trade deficit have already taken place No mention was made however of the US commitment to cut the budget deficit even though it is implied in the reafffirmation of Paris European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are essential to curbing the record US trade shortfall that reached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this week by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker A further sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would clearly pose substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could undermine confidence in future financial stability he said Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the politically independent Fed to drive up interest rates Monetary sources said that privately West Germany welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own currency remained relatively stable against the US unit Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak dollar blunts Tokyos export drive to the United States the Japanese monolith will concentrate on European markets The ministers meanwhile also continued talks on making their policy coordination more binding and one Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson said good progress was made Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations The United States and France backed by the International Monetary Fund want the seven to agree on ranges or norms for a limited number of economic objectives such as growth inflation monetary conditions trade balances and current account balances Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in consultations between the countries on whether corrective action should be required But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives has Bonn and London worried monetary sources say because it implies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit currency fluctuations just before the February meeting The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges of the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the relatively free currency markets of recent years
15562	West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said he was not surprised by the overnight decline of the dollar in foreign exchange markets Speaking briefly with reporters before entering a meeting of the International Monetary Fund he said These minor movements dont really affect us The dollar declined in the initial reaction to a statement by the Group of Seven industrial countries reaffirming their Paris agreement in February to maintain their currencies around current levels
15625	The dollar drifted down to end one pfennig lower after a lacklustre session held in limits by the lack of concrete news from the Group of Seven meeting and comments on the edge of the Washington IMFWorld Bank meeting Dealers said the communique early in the European morning from the G-7 meeting contained no significant new factors and although the dollar dipped it generally resisted further attempts to push it lower through the day The US Currency ended at 1827080 marks below yesterdays last 1836575 Koch said the assessment of the dollars direction was based on a global view with operators paying most attention to comments by finance officials to see how closely they stated adherence to international agreements such as those set at the Plaza Hotel in 1985 and in Paris on February 22 Koch described the wording of the communique from the G-7 as soft as wax Bundebank vice-president Helmut Schlesinger told Reuters in a telephone interview that the German central bank sees no current reason to change monetary course at present Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss which dealers said revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts may be under consideration German call money was slightly softer today at around 370 pct after 380 yesterday Some dealers said rates on new liquidity injections added via Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements may be cut next week Hopes of a cut were dashed on Tuesday with an allocation at an unchanged 380 pct But speaking of the pact tender rate next week Schlesinger said since the central bank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14 days this is hardly probable Euromark rates scarcely responded to the central bankers comments with six months funds ending unaltered at around 3-78 pct Eurodollars for the same maturity rose a fractional 116 pct from yesterday to around 6-1116 pct Sterling dipped to end at 2952956 marks after 2960965 last night The Swiss franc firmed slightly to 1203045 marks per 100 from 1202540 with the yen soaring however to 1257090 marks per 100 from 1251535 yesterday EMS currencies saw the French franc end unchanged from last night at 300306 marks per 100 with the Belgian franc easing however to 4829831 marks per 100 from 4831833
15689	The Federal Reserve was detected buying dollars for yen in the open market as the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 14460 yen in nervous late morning trading currency dealers said They said the size of the intervention was relatively modest so far but it was a clear indication that the US remained committed to the late February Paris currency stabilization accord which was reaffirmed in Washington last night A Fed spokeswoman had no comment on the dealer reports The dollar hovered around 14470 just before midday
16053	Economists said that they doubt the Federal Reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar despite higher discount window borrowings in the latest two-week statement period and very heavy borrowings Wednesday Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged 393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday up from 265 mln dlrs in the prior statement period Wednesday borrowings were 14 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 645 pct One could make a case that the Fed is firming but it probably isnt said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policy modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the two-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months However the Dean Witter economist noted that the latest two-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand often pushes up borrrowings Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy but it looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions late in the statement period and didnt quite make it said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today that the Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs or more in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday Still McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed The Fed took no market reserve management action last Thursday and Friday the first two days of the week It added temporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves directly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday Based on Fed data out today economists calculated that the two-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on Tuesday totaled around 59 billion dlrs They put Wednesdays overnight System repos at approximately 34 billion dlrs It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy at this time said Larry Leuzzi of SG Warburg and Co Inc Citing the view shared by the other two economists Leuzzi said the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak economies in the United States and abroad and add to the financial stress of developing countries and their lenders Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the latest statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar tumbled said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new statement period began today on disappointment yesterdays Washington meetings of international monetary officials failed to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid In fact currency dealers said there was nothing in Wednesdays G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade imbalance between the United States and Japan The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming for steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average Fed funds rate between six and 6-18 pct This is about where the rate has been since early November Im not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighter policy to help the dollar as some suspect said Sullivan of Dean Witter If it is however he said that Fed probably has just nudged up its funds rate goal to around 625 to 635 pct from six to 610 pct previously

16200	Top officials of leading industrial nations appear deeply worried that financial markets have ignored their efforts to coordinate policies which they believe they strengthened in talks last week Monetary sources said officials were exasperated that the markets which drove the dollar rapidly lower and severely disrupted bond and stock markets too did not take heed of the policy commitments of the Group of Seven -- the United States Japan West Germany France Britain Italy and Canada Treasury Secretary James Baker went out of his way to reassure markets of his commitment to a stable dollar with a statement and French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur underscored that by saying I dont believe at all that the Americans want a weaker dollar West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the dollars latest rapid descent involves the risk -- now already a tangible threat -- of a new strong surge of inflation leading to a renewed rise in interest rates But there were signs too that while policymakers feared the market uproar they seemed to accept there was little they could do until the economic picture changed and currencies settled into a stable pattern as a result Nor did there seem to be any enthusiasm at last weeks semi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank for higher US Interest rates as the best way to curb the dollars rapid descent That distaste stems in part from fears of recession Outgoing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told television interviewers he did not think a policy of driving the dollar down would solve the US trade deficit It would slow growth in Germany and Japan which would adversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it would drive interest rates up here which would throw us if not into recession into slower growth he said Asked if higher US Interest rates would stabilize the dollar Balladur said When a currency is maintained artificially high by artificially high interest rates it is not healthy And resorting to higher interest rates could lead to recession he said Acknowledging the dollars latest slide was now a fact of life Balladur said there may be adjustments of course in one or other currencies this is not a fixed rate system But Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said he might rein in credit if the dollars slide deepens US Monetary sources also said Washington wanted it understood by markets the sevens commitments were genuine The United States and the six major industrial countries are fully committed to implementing our undertakings in these agreements Baker told the meetings Darman said Baker had been misinterpreted by markets which wrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a further decline in the dollar Baker Darman said was committed to stabilizing currencies at current levels Last weeks statement from the seven reaffirmed a February 22 agreement in Paris in which the Reagan administration agreed to reach a budget deficit compromise with Congress and to fight protectionism West Germany and Japan meanwhile agreed to stimulate domestic demand and lead a global upturn Ministers believed the Paris pact was bolstered by Japans promise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget The sources said they believed Baker saw it as a major action But the seven seem to accept their commitment to stable currencies applied to todays exchange rates and not those at the time of the Paris agreement when the dollar stood higher The Paris accord said currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals given the policy commitments summarized in this statement Now they accept the dollars lower level especially against the yen as hard reality that is nonetheless consistent with the agreement The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals last weeks statement read Monetary sources said policymakers understood markets were focusing on instability created by the gap between the US Trade deficit and the surpluses of West Germany and Japan rather than prospective policy changes European monetary sources said Bonn was still unconvinced that Washington meant business with its commitment to cut the budget deficit

17871	The dollars recent signs of stability have raised hopes that its 27-month decline may be nearly over but most currency analysts refuse to commit themselves until after the June 12 release of US trade data for April The trade data will be a deciding factor to see if the dollar has bottomed out said Jim McGroarty of Discount Corp Since February 1985 the dollar has nearly halved its value against the yen and the mark as part of an officially orchestrated campaign to make US goods more competitive on world markets and redress gaping world trade imbalances On April 27 the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 13725 yen but has enjoyed a modest recovery over the last few weeks topping 145 yen today for the first time in nearly two months Many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen far enough to ease the trade deficits drag on the US economy The US trade gap narrowed to 136 billion dlrs in March from 151 billion in February and is expected to show continued improvement in April in volume if not in real terms Keiichi Udagawa of Bank of Tokyo in New York said that if further progress is reported the dollar would head back up towards 150 yen There is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomed out for the medium term added Tom Campbell of First National Bank of Chicago Other factors supporting this bullish view were growing expectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker would be reappointed for a third four-year term in August Japans larger-than-expected economic stimulus package last week and more favorably technical chart signals analysts said The dollar was also aided by Japans moves to dampen speculative selling in Tokyo and by reports of active central bank intervention to support the dollar The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last week that the US monetary authorities bought more than four billion dlrs during the February-April period -- the largest amount since the dollar crisis of the late 1970s Discount Corps McGroarty described the Feds intervention volume as impressive James ONeill of Marine Midland Bank was not so positive however the dollar has not yet bottomed out After the trade data are released the dollar could fall towards 177 marks and 140 yen Similarly Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank in New York warned I dont think the dollar has bottomed out yet Although the dollar could rise as high as 14650 yen Okada said market impatience about the painstakingly slow decline of the US trade deficit may lead to renewed pressure Currency analysts also warned about an unfavorable reaction to the seven-nation economic Summit on June 8 to 10 in Venice which is likely to focus on the implementation of previous commitments rather than yield any fresh initiatives President Reagan said today economic policy decisions made last year in Tokyo and at this years meetings of Group of Seven finance ministers in Paris and Washington cannot be ignored or forgotten The commitments made at these meetings need to be translated into action he added in a speech celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Marshall aid plan for Europe Now that Tokyo has unveiled its fiscal stimulus package analysts expected Bonn and the dollarmark rate to bear the brunt of US calls for further action Marine Midlands ONeill said pressure will build up on Germany to take stimulative action like Japan Some Japanese bank dealers warned that although the dollar could hold above 145 yen for some months it could also come under attack again if it seems the latest economic package is not having much impact on Japans economy and its trade surplus Reflecting a longer-term uncertainty some some trust banks and Japanese insurers are keeping their short dollar positons hedged against exchange losses in their foreign portfolios while some others have started covering those short positions Japanese bank dealers said

19028	New US Banking data suggest the Federal Reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady path and is not signalling any imminent change of course economists said But they also said that if money supply growth remains weak as this weeks unexpected eight billion dlr M-1 decline suggests it may this could influence the Fed to loosen its credit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetary policy A Reuter survey of 17 money market economists produced a forecast of a 600 mln dlr M-1 decline for the week ended June 8 with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to a decline of four billion Instead M-1 fell eight billion dlrs to 7457 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate Coming on the heels of a 43 billion decrease in M-1 for the week ended June 1 this means the nations money supply has fallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks economists said M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator of economic growth Sullivan said Fed officials might be concerned the latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growth in the broader monetary aggregates M-2 and M-3 which are seen as better gauges of economic growth Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May both measures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Feds 5-12 to 8-12 pct target ranges If money growth does not accelerate Fed officials concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging could turn toward easier monetary policy economists said Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current open market position No Sullivan said But does this mean the end of tightening for the time being Definitely yes Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings of 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement period were lower than they had expected Most believed the Fed had targetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs But they said that if it had not been for a large one-day net miss in the Feds reserve projections the higher borrowings target would probably have been reached A drop in May US Housing starts and continued weakness in auto sales show key sectors of the US Economy are lagging while a recent modest 03 pct gain in May producer prices has helped dispel inflation fears Slifer said If this continues we can entertain the notion of Fed easing at some point he said Other economists said the Fed would probably pay little attention to weak money supply growth It has been a number of years since M-1 has given good signs of whats going on in the economy one said I dont think M-1 shows that the economy is falling apart and the Fed should ease Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a prerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetary policy They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term rates for fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and higher inflation which would push up long-term yields and choke off econmomic growth But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late April The Fed has to determine if this represents a fundamental change for the dollar If it does then this gives them more room to ease he said

17620	A cut of about half a percentage point in Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect although economists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank encouraged by a strong guildermark relationship and wide premiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German might lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first Last month the Central Bank lowered its special advances rate to 51 pct from 525 pct after the Bundesbank dropped its repurchase tender rate to 355 pct from 38 pct That rate has remained in force just holding above the five pct official secured loans rate which governs commercial bank borrowings Given a strong guilder a further fall in the West German repo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff forcing an official Dutch rate cut analysts said In February when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate to three pct from 35 pct the Central Bank only lowered money market rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loans rate on lending under its three month credit quota Since then however both the Central Bank and Finance Ministry have made it clear they favour lower official rates In April Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said he would follow any Bundesbank cut and last week the Finance Ministry expressed satisfaction when it raised 225 billion guilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 10010 pct for an effective yield of 598 pct the lowest since 1965 Technically analysts said there has to be a difference between the secured loans rate which applies to lending under the credit quota and the tariff on special advances which add extra liquidity to the money market Bank economists and dealers said a West German move to further lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts would result in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate provided the guildermark relationship permitted The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around its parity value within the European Monetary System of 112673 guilders per 100 marks Today foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10 guilder cents to 112705 guilders per 100 at the fix a level that would not permit a change in the interest rate differential between West Germany and the Netherlands dealers said An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German and Dutch interest rates to ease in the short term However he said new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation expectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates in the longer term In the Netherlands the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil or even negative while the latest official economic forecasts point to a falling rate of economic growth It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement negotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation the ABN economist said He said Dutch money supply growth which ran at 34 pct in January could also contribute to some inflation At Amro Bank a leading analyst said inflation could run to two pct next year The bank expects Dutch capital market rates currently averaging around 61 pct to stop easing in the second half of this year and stabilize around 56 pct Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying spree on the bond market which would bring yields down probably only temporarily while money rates could fall below five pct Currently all periods are traded at 512 to 525 pct in the money market

15063	Cheap oil feedstocks the weakened US dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined US petrochemical industry to record profits this year with growth expected through at least 1990 major company executives predicted This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp ltGAF privately-held Cain Chemical Inc and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc ltASH the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period said Paul Oreffice chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co ltDOW adding Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics are expected to buy quantities this year US petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year said John Dosher managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct he said Oreffice speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history In 1985 when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong US dollar Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it Oreffice said GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the US chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987 Last year the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs a 54 pct leap from 1985 The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning said Paces John Dosher Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies That helped boost US chemical exports Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s Finally virtually all major US chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts GAF which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp ltUK recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp ltBOR a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals Another industry powerhouse WR Grace ltGRA has divested its retailing restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities such as ethylene in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers Companies like DuPont ltDD and Monsanto Co ltMTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated Dosher said But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market Some top chemical executives share the concern The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes GAFs Heyman cautioned The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised Specialty businesses do not stay special long Houston-based Cain Chemical created this month by the Sterling investment banking group believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend Chairman Gordon Cain who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business has spent 11 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous high-margin business Cain said adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually Garo Armen an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum wood and steel products Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years provided the US economy continues its modest rate of growth

14891	Kuwaits oil-reliant and debt-ridden economy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices will determine the pace of recovery bankers and economists say Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to hold oil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the northern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens Bankers estimate the economy measured in terms of gross domestic product gdp shrank 19 pct in real terms last year after contracting 81 pct the year before This was after taking into account inflation in consumer prices of 15 pct in 1985 slowing to 10 pct in 1986 Factors depressing economic activity include the 6-12-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwaits doorstep which threatens the emirates vital oil export lifeline through the Gulf and has sapped business confidence But sentiment received a much-needed boost in September when after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis caused by the 1982 crash of local stock market a comprehensive new debt settlement program was introduced The share crash result of a speculative spree in forward trading left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default The cheques were also used as collateral for consumer spending thus generating an informal credit system Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are still owed by individuals and companies There was some 44 billion dinars about 157 billion dlrs in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986 of which one-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as bad or doubtful debt But the government has repeatedly said it will not allow any banks to go under The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of problem credit over 10 to 15 years depending on whether debtors have regular cash flows or not Banks shareholders and depositors will have their rights guaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance in a country of only 17 mln people where the financial sector is the biggest after oil Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride out the oil glut bankers and economists say Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948000 barrels per day bpd compared with production capacity of 40 mln bpd mentioned last year by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah But strategic diversification into downstream operations in Europe several years ago and a hefty refining investment at home gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell over one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average 200 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed product such as gas oil kerosene and naphtha rather than as crude Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason for cautious optimism Other reasons are low domestic inflation a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent years and signs government spending on productive sectors will remain steady External accounts are in good shape with an estimated 18 billion dinar current account surplus in 1986 16 pct below that for 1985 but still an achievement in the recession-hit Gulf Kuwaits petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put officially at over 80 billion dlrs earning investment income of the equivalent of about 365 billion dlrs a year But for the first time since the end of the oil boom these reserves may not be enough to prevent a real budget deficit for the 198687 fiscal year ending June 30 bankers say In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary revenues for 198687 were cut 386 pct and spending 11 pct doubling the nominal deficit to 133 billion dinars This left out income from state reserves usually excluded in official budget accounting which are forecast by bankers at up to 10 billion dinars in 198687 resulting in some shortfall Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for economic growth this year or next It depends on oil prices one said This summer is important Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sunday the cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state spending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the economy He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be spelled out in the 198788 budget possibly in June
15551	The global economy is expected to weaken this year adding new worries to an already serious poverty outlook economic analysts said For finance ministers and central bankers attending this weeks semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank the new figures released by the IMF add an additional concern The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 27 pct this year versus 29 pct last year and 31 pct in 1985 In the industrial countries Gross National Product a measure of all goods and services was expected to decline to 23 pct this year compared with 24 pct in 1986 the IMF said For the developing countries the Gross Domestic Product another measure of economic growth was expected to fall to 30 pct from 35 pct last year The new figures are considered a major disappointment to the poorest countries They had hoped that new vitality in the industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope with growing mounds of debt IMF officials discussing their outlook said they believed the industrial country economies would move up to an annual growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier states for markets for their products as well as financial assistance economic weakness in the developed nations economies poses fundamental worries Debtor countries including the very poorest states have only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange including the key one of exports The US economy which is in its fifth year of expansion has served as a mainstay for developing country exports but it too is seen as being rather feeble this year growing by only 23 pct according to the IMF For this reason and because of a high trade deficit the United States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to ignite their economies but with little apparent success The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and the curious lack of impact it has had on the US trade deficit Reagan administration officials have been saying that the impact is now beginning to show up although it has been much slower than expected The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that it has to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years to get a resonably complete effect The report added however the adjustments may take even more time on this occasion REUTERM 
16108	The government must announce harsh cuts in spending in its May 14 economic statement if it is to give an adequate response to Australias economic problems the ANZ Banking Group Ltd ltANZAS said Cuts of two billion dlrs would be insufficient against the backdrop of a 12 billion dlr government deficit and a 14 billion dlr current account deficit it said in its monthly Business Indicators publication For the past two years the government has struggled with an economic reality that demands measures beyond those which it sees as politically practicable it said The political climate meant there would be a continued over-reliance on monetary policy to hold the exchange rate and maintain confidence in economic management ANZ said The cost of this approach is that the much-needed revival of business investment will be further postponed it said The economy was now on a modest growth upswing boosted by export and import-replacement industries which had created a false suggestion that the worst adjustments to the balance of payments crisis were past Unfortunately successful adjustment to Australias deep-seated economic problems remains a long-term process it said In its economic forecasts ANZ said it expected moderate overall economic growth with gross domestic product GDP rising 27 pct this year and 24 pct in 1988 The current account deficit would narrow to five pct of GDP this year and 43 pct in 1988 and net foreign debt would grow strongly from 81 billion at the end of 1986 to 972 billion at end-1987 and 1103 billion a year later Inflation would fall to 85 pct in 1987 and 75 pct in 1988 from 89 pct in 1986 and further falls in real wages were expected ANZ said
16158	The five leading West German economic research institutes have failed to agree about how strongly the domestic economy will expand this year but revised down forecasts contained in a report published six months ago The three research groups of Kiel Hamburg and Essen predicted in the institutes joint spring report that gross national product GNP would rise by two pct in 1987 compared with 24 pct in 1986 The five institutes had jointly forecast three pct 1987 growth in October last year Taking a dissenting view the DIW institute of West Berlin and Munichs Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth The joint report said that the estimates of economic development made by the DIW and Ifo were markedly less favourable than those of the other three The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a slow start to the year In the second half of 1987 there will however only be a weak upward movement they said The two institutes said external economic factors which were currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would dominate the economic environment throughout the year They saw exports falling by a real 2-12 pct in 1987 and predicted no marked improvement in the course of the year The other three institutes however wrote The decline in demand and production seen in the winter months does not indicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate uncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans But they expected that many investments had not been cancelled but only put off It can be presumed that the braking actions on the economy will diminish markedly this year They added The domestic prerequisites for a continuation of the economic uptrend are still favourable These three institutes said diminishing external burdens combined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in demand and production could be expected by the spring However this projection was clouded by risks including the further development of the mark against the dollar Contrary to the DIW and Ifo the three institutes said that while exports would continue to be the weak point of the economy in 1987 there is good reason to believe that exports will soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during the course of the year They predicted an overall 05 pct fall in exports in 1987 the same as in 1986 The three more positive institutes saw private consumption rising by four pct in 1987 compared with 42 pct in 1986 while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase They saw the climate for equipment investment improving but predicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 46 pct in 1986 Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in unemployment The Kiel Hamburg and Essen institutes said the jobless total would average 217 mln in 1987 compared with 223 mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in work of about 200000 These three institutes said new jobs would be created mainly in the private services sector and also by the state in the context of job creation measures The construction industry was likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980 but they predicted either no rise in employment in the manufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur only in the tertiary sector while the number employed in the manufacturing industry will decline The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to 220 mln in 1987 from 223 mln in 1986 They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58 billion marks from 78 billion in 1986 The other three saw a current account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marks and predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around 100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986 The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start to rise in 1987 after they declined in 1986 and all five predicted an average increase over the year of 05 pct
16171	The five leading West German economic research institutes said the government should do more to stimulate economic growth and called for early introduction of tax cuts planned for 1990 In their joint spring report the institutes were divided about 1987 growth forecasts with three predicting two pct expansion and the other two only one pct growth Gross national product grew 24 pct last year But the report said all the institutes believed that more must be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additional jobs can be created The institutes said any step which improved basic economic conditions should be taken as quickly as possible From this point of view the tax reform planned for 1990 should be brought forward The government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billion marks as part of the major tax reform The net tax relief from the tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks However the institutes criticised the government not only for the timing of the reform but also because the question of its financing had been left open The government has not specified how the remaining 19 billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies The institutes said this lack of clarity from Bonn had caused uncertainty among companies and households as to what exactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged a quick decision from the government They also said the government should reduce tax preferences which would simplify the fiscal system urged a restriction of state spending and called for no increase in value-added tax The institutes also criticised Bonn for increasing subsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged They referred specifically to a doubling of special writedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in a package of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described this as an increase in subsidies The institutes said total subsidies including tax preferences had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risen further since then Given the scope of these subsidies it should be possible despite  Major political difficulties to finance the tax reform by cutting state handouts The institutes said that if the government raised value added tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of the positive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost The report also noted that the government was progressing only slowly with its plans to privatise state companies and said more deregulation was needed The government had to aim for more competition it said
16196	West German Economics Minister Martin Bangemann indirectly rejected a call from the countrys leading economic research institutes for early introduction of a major tax reform involving gross tax cuts of 44 billion marks In a statement reacting to the five institutes joint spring report Bangemann said that as far as the call for bringing forward the 1990 tax reform was concerned --The government points out that the positive effects for growth of its policy of consolidation cutting the budget deficit must not be allowed to be endangered Bangemann also recalled that the scope of tax cuts planned for 1988 had already been increased Three institutes predicted two pct economic growth in 1987 with exports falling by 05 pct The other two saw only one pct growth and said exports would fall 25 pct Bangemann said The government agreeing with the majority sees no reason for the extraordinarily pessimistic estimate for exports expressed by the minority He said there was reason to believe that export demand would start to rise in the course of the year partly because of a further increase in world trade
16197	Italys Gross Domestic Product calculated at 1980 prices rose 24 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 compared with the same period in 1985 National Statistics Institute ISTAT said ISTAT said in a statement that GDP growth in fourth quarter 1986 was zero compared with the preceding quarter Italys budget ministry said last month that 1986 GDP rose 27 pct in real terms from 1985 Imports in the fourth quarter totalled 26361 billion lire down 14 pct from the 1985 fourth quarter and down 66 pct from the third 1986 quarter ISTAT said Istat said exports totaled 23190 billion lire in the fourth quarter down 41 pct from the comparable 1985 quarter and down 67 pct from the third quarter in 1986 Fixed investments were 23438 billion lire in the fourth quarter down 07 pct from the preceding quarter and up 11 pct from the comparable 1985 quarter
16201	The five leading West German economic research institutes which have revised down their forecasts for 1987 growth do not predict a recession in West Germany their spokesman Hans-Juergen Schmahl said The institutes were divided in their spring report on forecasts for 1987 with three predicting two pct growth and two seeing only one pct expansion Growth was 24 pct in 1986 Schmahl presenting the report at a news conference said None of the institutes reckons with a recession or with the beginning of a recession He added however that exports remained the weak point of the economy  Schmahl also said West Germany would have to expect further encroachments of foreign goods onto its markets Arthur Krumper of Munichs Ifo institute which with the DIW of West Berlin had presented the more pessimistic view of the economy said The braking effects on the economy produced by external factors will remain considerable for most of the year
16226	Portugals economy which has been enjoying one of its most buoyant periods in more than a decade may now be strong enough to shrug off the countrys latest government crisis analysts said But the April 3 ousting of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silvas government could slow economic reforms and investment as Portugal continues to adapt to membership in the European Community which it joined in January last year they said Cavaco Silvas minority Social Democratic Party PSD was toppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties The centre-right administration had made economic growth reform a priority in its 17 months in office In 1986 Portugals economy grew four pct its current account surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs and inflation fell to 10 pct from 20 pct in 1985 Analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instability were worrying but they felt the foundations for continued growth had not been badly shaken The economy has developed a certain self-confidence that is now less dependent on the political situation said Fritz Haser economics professor at Universidade Livre Lisbon The market doesnt see this as a real crisis yet economist Jorge Braga de Macedo told Reuters Businessmen have identified political instability over the last 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lasting economic progress The PSD administration was the 16th formed since the 1974 revolution Portugals developing stock markets however remain buoyant Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surge in economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largely underpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank of Portugal forecast released on the day the PSD government fell predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growth would remain at similar levels this year But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policies and could slow economic development Soares who is expected to announce a decision by the end of the month can either call early elections or form a new government from parties in the existing left wing-dominated parliament Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quick elections as the best solution There is a good chance that a majority government could result from early elections Confederation of Portuguese Industry CIP president Pedro Ferraz da Costa said He said they were optimistic this could mean the continuation in the near future of liberalisation policies introduced over the last year The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution but the PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion polls say they could win an overall majority A PSD majority would also open the way for more wide-ranging reforms such as relaxation of labour laws and possible denationalisation of industry the analysts said Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition parties of blocking key economic reforms The left-wingers said Portugals positive economic results were more the product of favourable international conditions such as cheaper oil and raw material imports than of PSD policies
16268	Four of West Germanys five leading economic research institutes warned that excessive monetary growth threatened a resurgence of inflation But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin echoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials said the expansion seen over the last 1-12 years did not necessarily threaten stability The five institutes issued a joint spring report in which three -- Kiel Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise in GNP in 1987 while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome in view of the slowdown in economic activity But experience has shown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a price rise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears may seem exaggerated they said But it has often turned out in the past that the price climate can quickly deteriorate forcing the central bank into a restrictive policy they said The economic costs of a preventive stability policy are less than fighting inflation once it has taken hold they said The four institutes disputed the view that monetary expansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domestic investors switch liquidity into longer term capital market investments following lower interest rates Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion of central bank money stock but do not automatically lead to a smaller expansion of money supply they said A return to growth and stability did not require spectacular central bank moves but could be done quietly with open market operations and repurchase pacts which would avoid an interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations The DIW institute said monetary policy should not be focused simply on growth of production potential Because of uncertainty about exchange rate developments and economic weakness other factors should be taken into account Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cuts and avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluation speculation Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threat in itself to price stability The 197981 inflation following strong 197778 money growth reflected other causes such as rising oil prices and the falling mark
17883	Bundesbank vice president Helmut Schlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now With money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down in May and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark Schlesinger told Reuters that he was not convinced that a further cut in interest rates was needed The economy is picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted 12 to one pct in the first quarter from the fourth he added We may have an increase in gnp starting in the second quarter he said in an interview Concerned by the first quarter downturn the US Has been pressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost its imports either through fiscal or monetary policy Schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was mainly due to adverse weather conditions just as occured in 1986 Year-on-year growth was thus about two pct He estimated that economic growth for the year as a whole would probably be between one and two pct It is not a question of monetary conditions if domestic demand does not grow strongly he said noting that interest rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money stock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year pace of 7-12 to eight pct well above the Bundesbanks three to six pct target He said the target could still be achieved but much will depend on the direction of long-term capital flows Heavy inflows particularly in January around the time of the EMS revaluation boosted domestic money supply There is still a certain hope that the net inflow of foreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bit reversed Schlesinger said A major reason for the inflows was the markets conviction that the mark was headed higher As we can see from the market expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark have diminished Schlesinger said The recent widening of interest rate differentials the fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined towards stabilizing the dollar he said Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollar rise as the US Did in March when the dollar rose above 187 marks he said this would depend on the circumstances At midday here the dollar stood at 1834045 marks Central banks are always in contact about these fluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react Schelsinger said One has to look at how it the market is moving he said adding It is not only our own case it is also the American case He said that the West German export industry has been hit hard by the dollars sharp fall and would probably like to see some correction now But it wouldnt be good to have short-term fluctuations he said Let us wait and see It is mainly the strength of the dollar fall in a very short period which was a little bit of a shock than the level of rates as such Schlesinger said The sharp rise of the mark coupled with weak prices of such key commodities as oil had a favourable impact on West German inflation down year Although there have recently been signs of inflation picking up he said that this was due to changes in key commodity prices The underlying inflation rate this year would be unchanged at about one to 1-12 pct he said Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth was longer term in that the economy was building up the potential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation The above-target growth of money supply over the past 16 months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of targets themselves a matter which might be taken up at the mid-year meeting of the Bundesbanks council Schlesigner said But he added I dont see any great pressure to go away from it
17896	The Philippines first quarter growth figures released yesterday indicated the government was likely to achieve its 1987 targets Central Bank governor Jose Fernandez said in an interview The National Economic Development Authority NEDA announced yesterday gross domestic product GDP grew 578 pct and gross national product GNP 553 pct in the first quarter from a year earlier I dont see anything on the horizon that should cut it growth short Fernandez said NEDA said GNP had grown 356 pct and GDP 325 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 from a year earlier Last years GNP growth put earlier at 013 pct was revised to 151 pct Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resources and if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume that domestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated and would not be a stumbling block Fernandez said I think even before the figures came out simply looking at key indicators such as consumption of fuel oil and power showed that the economy was on a different track from last year he said Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in the first and second quarters because of the dry weather and it could drop off in the third quarter He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in the manufacturing sector which grew by 964 pct after declines in 1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986 That is not a seasonal thing it is secular he said He said the government had met all monetary targets set for the first quarter in consultation with the International Monetary Fund IMF It expected to draw down the fourth tranche from its 198 mln SDR stand-by arrangement soon The Philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling 58 mln SDRs from the arrangement expiring on April 23 1988 Fernandez said an IMF mission would visit here in July or August to review performance in the January-June period He said IMF repayments were projected to total 156 billion dlrs over the 1987-92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs Repayments were inevitable and many countries would find their net repayments to the IMF rising in the next few years It means that since there will be a net drain on ODA official development assistance accounts the commercial banking system will be requested to hold the line he said It is an internal constraint that exists because the IMF debt cannot be rescheduled Fernandez said The Philippines rescheduled 103 billion dlrs of its 28 billion dlr foreign commercial debt in March Fernandez said Central Bank bills introduced in March 1984 to mop up excess liquidity had peaked at 431 billion pesos in April 1986 But their unwinding on maturity dates started in October last year had almost been completed He said auctions of treasury bills whose outstanding level touched 9544 billion pesos on May 20 were going well Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool he said Commenting on the countrys foreign debt Fernandez said I think the Philippine debt stock looms large because our own receipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leap forward as might have been suitable The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach 2904 billion dlrs by the end of 1987 NEDA said exports totalled 12 billion dlrs in the first quarter while imports were 14 billion dlrs Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth of between six and 65 pct this year He cautioned that while growth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by some economists that the peso currently pegged at 2050 to the dollar ought to be devalued to make the countrys exports more competitive By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the peso has already substantially devalued against all of the countrys trading partners he said On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code he said he was opposed to a clause which would allow the unrestricted repatriation abroad of investments made during the first two years after the imposition of the Code The imposition of the Code scheduled for last January has been delayed by objections from some business groups I think any central bank certainly this one after the events of the past two or two and a half years has to be prudent This is not the time to throw all caution to the winds and Im not about to do that Fernandez said It would be ideal if we reach a point where movement of capital and earnings can be free he said We have had one year of reasonably good results Certainly we continue to have a fairly heavy drain on our external availabilities simply by servicing our debts
17906	Figures for first quarter 1987 West German GNP will be published on June 11 after they were provisionally scheduled for June 4 an official at the Federal Statistics Office said The official said there had been a delay in gathering information for the data which are expected to show that the West German economy contracted in the period A spokesman for the Economics Ministry in Bonn said there was no political motivation behind publishing the figures on June 11 the day after the Venice economic summit ends There is no political motivation It is a purely technical matter he added The West German government is expected to come under pressure in Venice from both the US And its European partners to stimulate domestic demand as a way of reducing international trade imbalances and contributing to world economic growth However government officials have ruled out any further tax reduction packages to supplement a major program of stimulatory fiscal measures already underway Helmut Schlesinger vice-president of the West German central bank the Bundesbank said in Tokyo today that GNP the widest measure of a countrys economic activity fell in real terms by a seasonally adjusted 12 to one pct in the first quarter compared with the fourth 1986 period The government has confirmed that growth was negative in the first 1987 quarter But year-on-year growth is expected to be about two pct Schlesinger today repeated the Bundesbanks reluctance to cut its official interest rates further Its key discount rate at three pct is just above historical lows West German officials are likely to emphasise at the Venice summit that domestic demand which draws in goods from abroad is already outstripping export performance which has suffered from an 80 pct rise of the mark against the dollar in just over two years The government has pointed out that depressed exports are the main reason for the current weakness in the economy but says that later in the year stronger domestic demand will compensate for this setback It expects GNP growth for the whole of 1987 of just under two pct after a 24 pct rise in 1986
17970	South Africa is expected to unveil tomorrow an expansionary budget for the second consecutive year in a bid to boost the nations flagging economic growth rate economic analysts said Faced with competing demands for increased military and police spending and the pressing need for more funds for black housing and education Finance Minister Barend Du Plessis is expected to raise significantly the governments overall expenditure targets when he presents the budget to parliament the analysts said Analysts expect Du Plessis to provide for a rise in state spending at least equal to the 16 pct inflation rate for the financial year that started on April 1 while ignoring pleas from the private sector to stimulate growth by cutting taxes Fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary but simply raising government spending and increasing the budget deficit is an inflationary form of stimulation said Rob Lee chief economist at South African Mutual Life Assurance Co South Africa this year is targeting inflation-adjusted growth in GDP of three pct against an increase last year of less than one pct Growth in GDP over the past decade has averaged about 15 pct while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled to over 30 pct Economists estimate that the governments spending target will rise to about 47 billion rand with revenue budgeted at around 40 billion rand This would leave a budget deficit before borrowing of about seven billion rand or four pct of GDP The government having consistently overshot its own spending targets for more than a decade also faces a credibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in the budget analysts said The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure said Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview Many analysts in the private sector are now paying less attention to the figures presented in the budget and are using their own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for the money and capital markets South African Mutuals Lee believes government spending will again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49 billion rand this year leaving a deficit of between 5 and 55 pct of GDP compared with a three pct limit suggested by the IMF The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned predicted one analyst noting that South Africa has moved steadily away from austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the past two years The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in the political situation and the onset of an economic crisis triggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll over loans to the country in September 1985 Against a background of Western economic sanctions falling per capita incomes rising joblessness and high inflation government officials say economic growth is the prime objective But private-sector economists caution that the governments ability to promote growth by boosting state spending is constrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on the current account of the countrys balance of payments Most of that surplus this year estimated at around 25 billion dlrs will be swallowed up by repayments on the nations estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of an arrangement reached earlier this year with major international creditor banks Within these constraints economists believe Du Plessis has little room to manoeuvre Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries and budgeted spending increases for the state-owned Post Office and South African Transport Services suggest that major tax concessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely Du Plessis earlier this year announced small concessions for taxpayers in a mini-budget before the May 6 whites-only election The poll delayed presentation of the national budget This will not be a very exciting budget commented Harry Schwarz spokesman on finance for the liberal Progressive Federal Party I do not expect any major tax cuts as all the sweets were given out before the election
18009	Pakistan says its economy has continued its recent outstanding performance during the financial year 198687 ending on June 30 but areas like balance of payments investments and energy were causing concern GDP grew in line with the average growth rate since 1980 and the inflation rate was the lowest since 196970 according to a government economic survey The reform of economic regulation had gathered momentum and there was an impressive performance in a five point government program for rural uplift education and poverty alleviation said the survey Ministry Economic Adviser Qazi Alimullah told a news conference that before recent unseasonal rains and hailstorms damaged the wheat crop GDP growth was calculated at 704 pct compared to 725 pct in 198586He said the figure might now slide down a little to around 68 or 69 pct The survey said monetary expansion was estimated to be nine pct to date but might rise to around 12 pct by the year-end Alimullah said exports rose 18 pct to 35 billion dlrs from 29 billion dlrs in 198586 But the at the same time home remittances by Pakistanis abroad dropped to 23 billion dlrs from the 198586 level of 2595 billion More exports and an improvement in the balance of payments situation will be required to overcome this declining trend in home remittances he said The survey said the trade deficit was expected to fall to 24 billion dlrs from three billion dlrs in 198586 because of the boost in exports He said national investment continued to be small because of a poor rate of savings about 14 pct of GDP He said more savings were required to maintain or possibly step up the present growth rate and to finance the countrys seventh five-year development plan to be launched in July 1988
18095	The West German governments independent council of economic experts believes a further stimulation of the economy is inappropriate government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said A statement released by Ost after a meeting of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and senior government officials with the council said the experts believed 1987 ecomomic growth of 1-12 to two pct was achievable It added the council believed an intensification of the already expansionary stimulation of monetary and financial policy is not called for Osts statement said experts believed further pressure on West Germany to adapt to external economic factors would not increase The government regularly uses the term changed external economic factors when referring to the fall of the dollar which has severely damaged West German exports Bonn officials have said they expect exports to pick up during the year but could still fall below the 1986 level Along with other leading industrial countries West Germany agreed to a package of measures at a meeting in Paris in February aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar The stance taken by the experts backs up the official position of the West German government ahead of next weeks seven nation summit in Venice where Bonn is expected to be pressed by the US And other partners to boost its economy West German government officials have stressed Bonn is not in a position to stimulate growth further since tax cuts due next year and 1990 are already stretching the budget The Bundesbank has also ruled out a quick cut in official interest rates although it sees market rates continuing low The experts prediction for economic growth this year of between 1-12 and two pct is a slight downward revision from a forecast made last November when two pct growth was forecast Many independent forecasters have revised down 1987 predictions in light of the downturn in exports The government itself has said it expects growth of just under two pct compared with a 24 pct expansion in 1986

18911	A trade-led boom in the US is unlikely this year or next because growth in net exports will merely offset a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending and other sectors of the economy Bank of America said in its latest economic report Although net exports will add 07 pct to GNP this year after reducing it by 12 pct in 1986 consumer spending will contribute 14 pct less to GNP than it did last year As a result GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 25 pct the same rate as last year according to Daniel Van Dyke the Bank of America economist who wrote the report Growth in consumer spending in the United States will drop dramatically this year because the jump in inflation will cause a falloff in the growth of disposable income Van Dyke said Growth in US consumer spending is likely to slow to 18 pct this year from 41 pct in 1986 he predicted The report was released before the Commerce Department reported today that personal income rose just 02 pct in May after increasing 04 pct in April and that personal consumption expenditures had risen just 01 pct compared with a 06 pct increase the month before The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boost consumer prices by an average of 37 pct this year up from 19 pct in 1986 Bank of America forecast This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income growth to only 13 pct in 1987 from 29 pct in 1986 As a result Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing power of an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrs this year compared to a surge of 1210 dlrs during 1986 The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housing starts to drop by 42 pct this year and a further six pct in 1988 to an annual rate of 163 mln units For the first time in several years a recession in 1988 or 1989 is more than a remote possibility Van Dyke said Currently US growth is fragile and depends heavily on an improvement in trade However with protectionist attitudes on the rise in this country this source of growth is at risk he added
18985	West German economic growth will slow to 15 pct this year from 24 pct in 1986 due to weak domestic demand and tougher competition from abroad the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD said in its semi-annual review of the world economy This view is less favourable than the West German governments forecast of a growth rate of under two pct this year but is in line with forecasts by independent economic institutes of growth ranging from 15 to two pct The OECD said that the economy should pick up next year with the gross national product rising by two pct in real terms The OECD said it assumed the German economy was passing through a period of temporary weakness and there would be some recovery in business confidence in the near future But it warned that the key to an improvement in the economy was higher domestic demand which is only forecast to rise by 25 pct this year and 275 pct in 1988 below 1986s 37 pct While noting that the government is bringing forward a five billion mark tax reform to January 1988 the OECD said that the medium to longer-term performance of the West German economy could be improved by reduction of subsidies - which would allow relatively lower tax rates Since the OECD report was compiled the West German Federal Statistics Office has released figures showing that the GNP actually fell 05 pct in real terms in the first quarter of this year compared with the final three months of 1986 Diplomatic sources here said that West Germany appeared likely to finish the year with the lowest growth rate of any of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations West Germanys current account surplus the target of considerable criticism by the Reagan administration is expected to rise slightly to 37 billion dlrs this year from 358 billion in 1986 before declining to 29 billion dlrs in 1988
18987	Frances growth rate is expected to strengthen in the second half of this year after a poor first half but unemployment will worsen the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD said In its semi-annual review of the world economy the OECD forecast that growth in the French Gross Domestic Product GDP would run at about two pct in the next six months It said the rate would be in line with the 1986 trends but significantly higher than in the first half of this year The OECD said Frances economic situation has deteriorated somewhat during the early months of 1987 Activity has slowed primarily reflecting an inventory adjustment while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflation has reaccelerated the OECD said Unemployment is likely to reach 12 pct of the workforce by the end of 1988 The report said inflation should slow and domestic demand pick up in the second half of this year But both data are likely to be worse than those recorded in 1986 it added The OECD forecast a 275 pct rise in consumer prices for the second half of this year a one pct drop from the first six months The slowdown would bring the inflation rate to 325 pct for the whole year sharply up from last years 22 pct
18990	Italys economic outlook for 1987 and 1988 is likely to be less favourable than last year with slightly lower growth higher unemployment and an increased trade deficit the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD said But the OECD in its half-yearly report forecast a slightly lower inflation rate over the next two years Last year Italy ranked as one of the OECDs fastest growing economies with Gross Domestic Product GDP growth at 27 pct The OECD said Italys GDP may grow by three pct in 1987 but will then fall back to 25 pct in 1988 The inflation rate will probably stabilise at around five pct during the projection period as a result of a turnaround in import prices particularly oil an acceleration in labour costs and the effects of domestic demand pressure the report said This year and to a lesser degree in 1988 domestic demand should be stimulated by buoyant growth in household consumption made possible by wage increases following pay negotiations Domestic demand pressure coupled with the deterioration in Italian competitiveness is likely to stimulate imports and adversely affect exports in 1987 and 1988 This could result in a sharp negative contribution to the currrent account
18991	Japans trade surplus is likely to continue to grow in 1987 as sales of Japanese goods abroad increase while domestic demand remains sluggish the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD said In its latest half-yearly review of the world economy the OECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last year when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 while export markets rose by only two pct But it said this differential between the growth of domestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988 thus weakening the international adjustment process It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over two pct but with a rise in exports of 33 pct in 1987 and 36 pct in 1988 As a result the current account surplus in 1987 will rise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986 although in 1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6000 billion yen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand and increase imports to Japan However OECD officials said the measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand quite possibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects have worked through and thus will provide some stimulus to imports The OECD outlook said Continued large current account surpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantial net external asset position could well lead to upward pressure on the yen It said that further appreciation could then lead manufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus weaken domestic growth The OECD said Japans Gross National Product was likely to gorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988 below 1986s 25 pct growth But it said Japan would continue its good performance on inflation with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a 06 pct rise in consumer prices last year
18993	Economic growth will remain sluggish in the Netherlands and Belgium next year and unemployment may rise the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast Belgiums GDP growth may slow down to 15 pct this year and next year bringing a rise in the number of jobless the OECD said in its semi-annual survey Belgian inflation could stabilise at 15 to 20 pct while the current account surplus will probably remain large at about three pct of GDP While the Belgian government has made progress in trimming its borrowing requirement it will probably be insufficient to check the self-sustaining nature of the deficit the OECD said In the Netherlands real GDP growth will also slip to 15 pct this year and one pct in 1988 with Dutch exports becoming less competitive and imports rising Employment is forecast to decelerate as well reflecting more sluggish growth in the private sector and budgetary cuts the report said Dutch consumer prices are set to fall by 05 pct in 1987 and stay stable in 1988 partly as a result of declining domestic gas prices Luxembourgs economy by contrast will see slightly faster growth in GDP this year as a result of an upward movement in wages But real growth in consumption will ease next year
18994	Strong growth in domestic demand was a key feature of the economies of southern European countries in 1986 though the growth is seen slowing this year and next the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said In its semi-annual report the OECD said Portugals total domestic demand growth would decline from 76 pct last year to five pct in 1987 and 375 pct in 1988 as slower wage growth restrained private consumption Turkeys economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 and domestic demand surged 105 pct but this growth was expected to be halved to five pct next year In Spain buoyant domestic demand led by fixed investment had been the driving force behind rapid growth in Gross Domestic Product Both fixed investment and private consumption were expected to ease during 1988 but would still remain strong The OECD forecast that Spanish imports would rise sharply next year reflecting strong demand entry to the European Community and declining competitiveness In Greece inflation was forecast to turn downwards following an increase early this year linked with the introduction of Value Added Tax and a surge in food prices due to cold weather
18995	High wage settlements in Nordic countries threaten to cut exports and reduce the international competitiveness of their industries the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD said In Denmark the OECD said wage settlements concluded in early 1987 were likely to contribute to a marked deterioration in competitiveness Swedens competitive position was also seen at risk from accelerating wages The OECD predicted that domestic demand would come under pressure from tight fiscal policy in Denmark as well as Norway Sweden and Finland Overall economic growth will vary in the different countries between 1986 and 1988 the OECD semi-annual report said After a strong rise of 78 pct in 1986 total domestic demand in Norway was seen falling by 15 pct in 1987 and one pct the following year Denmark was also expected to see a slump in domestic demand The report said growth in Gross Domestic Product GDP was likely to speed up slightly in Sweden and Finland in 1987 and 1988 while declining in Denmark and Norway Iceland needs to try harder to implement its new economic strategy if any more progress is to be made towards sustained and balanced non-inflationary growth the OECD said
18996	The United States should take urgent action to cut its crippling budget deficit including possible reductions in non-defense spending higher taxes and curbs on growth of the defense budget the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said The OECD in its semi-annual review of the world economy said a failure of the Reagan Administration and Congress quickly to agree on measures to cut the deficit could seriously affect confidence both in the United States and elsewhere It predicted that the federal deficit in fiscal 1987 running until September 30 this year would substantially overshoot both the Balanced Budget Acts target of 144 billion dlrs and official US Estimates in February of 175 billion The OECD projection which is based on assumptions of slower growth higher interest rates and actual data for the first half of the financial year is for a deficit of about 190 billion dollars it said While this would be 30 billion lower than last years deficit much of the improvement would be due to corporate tax increases being introduced before income tax cuts take effect The US Economic growth rate is expected to edge up to 275 pct next year from 25 pct this year and last In contrast to the last two years more competitive exports boosted by the fall in the dollar should help GNP growth Unemployment should continue to fall slowly as the service sector continues to create jobs But inflation appears to be heading higher partly due to the lower dollar with consumer prices forecast to rise four pct this year and 45 pct next year after just 21 pct in 1986 Monetary and fiscal policy appear to be the key factors behind the avoidance of recession the report said The current account balance of payments deficit is expected to be still around a high 125 billion dlrs next year after hitting a projected record 14725 billion this year it said In Canada economic growth is expected to pick up slightly to around 275 pct in 1988 from 25 pct this year but will still be below levels seen in recent years Inflation is expected to slow to 35 pct next year from 375 pct this year unemployment should edge down to nine pct in 1988 from 925 pct this year Canadas current account deficit is projected to shrink to around four billion US Dlrs this year and to remain at about that level in 1988
19000	Prospects for world economic growth remain very sluggish and coordinated action by western governments is urgently needed to restore business confidence stabilize currencies and encourage investment the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD said here The economic situation has deteriorated in recent months and  Slow growth high unemployment and large payments imbalances are likely to persist it said in one of its gloomiest reviews of the world economy in recent years The gross national product GNP of the 24-nation bloc of western industrialised countries is forecast to grow by only 225 pct both this year and next even slower than last years 25 pct growth rate We would like to see the aggregate for the OECD area comfortably exceeding three pct David Henderson head of the OECDs economics and statistics department said The OECD said that the dollar fall had led to rising inflation expectations and higher interest rates in the US Combining with world trade imbalances and the huge third world debt problem to increase the risks of a world economic downturn At the same time many of the conditions for faster growth remain favorable it said citing low inflation in most major countries healthy corporate finances generally lower interest rates improvements in state budget positions and more flexible labor markets But private sector confidence had been undermined by uncertainties over exchange rates it said and warned that for confidence to be restored it is important for governments swiftly to implement internationally-agreed commitments This was a clear reference to last Februarys Louvre accord of the Group of Five nations plus Canada analysts said The OECD said that apparent disagreements among major countries on implementation of the Louvre accord had helped to undermine business confidence and called on more active fiscal policies from the US West Germany and Japan to slow demand in the US And raise it in the other two countries Henderson said the 6000 billion yen package announced recently by the Japanese government to encourage public works and cut taxes would make a significant contribution to this process though it was too early to estimate its precise impact He said the measures will help strengthen Japans domestic demand significantly quite possibly exceeding one pct of GNP The inflation outlook while broadly satisfactory has worsened in recent months with OECD consumer prices forecast to rise 35 pct this year and 375 pct in 1988 after a 28 pct increase in 1986 There is no prospect for any significant improvement in the unemployment situation over the next 18 months with the average rate expected to stabilize at 825 pct similar to last year The OECD called for efforts to liberalize world agricultural markets through switching farm subsidies away from price guarantees and other measures linked to production towards direct income support for farmers
19005	Australias economy should manage modest growth over the next two years after a sharp slowdown but unemployment could still edge upwards the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD said The organisations latest half-yearly report says Gross Domestic Product will grow by 25 pct this year and by 275 pct in 1988 compared with only 14 pct in 1986 The growth will be helped by higher stockbuilding and stronger domestic demand following tax cuts and higher real wages it added The report forecasts a decline in inflation with consumer prices increasing by 85 pct this year and 625 pct in 1988 The current account deficit shows signs of easing slightly and could narrow to 12 billion dlrs by the end of 1988 While predicting slightly stronger growth than last year however the report revises downwards the OECDs earlier growth forecast for 1987 of 375 pct The OECD predicts a similar combination of modest economic growth and rising unemployment for New Zealand which is struggling to recover from a major economic crisis The countrys GDP which contracted by 06 pct last year should again show growth over the next two years rising by 025 pct this year and a more substantial 275 pct in 1988
19017	Finance Minister Michael Wilson said tax reform will not affect his determination to reign in expenditures but his forecasts show a slowing of the decline in the budget deficit in the late 1980s Responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible Wilson said in a speech prepared for the House of Commons Wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 293 billion dlrs in the year ending March 31 1988 the same level as he forecast in the February budget And in the year ended this past March the deficit was expected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32 billion dlr shortfall originally forecast Wilson said Wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal year higher-than-anticipated spending particularly in farm income support programs will be offset by higher-than-anticipated revenues But finance department documents show the pace of deficit reduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and 1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and the transition to the reformed taxation system The deficit is expected to total 289 billion dlrs in fiscal 1989 and 286 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 261 billion dlrs in 1991 Wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the Canadian economy forcasting gross domestic product would expand 28 pct this year and 30 pct in 1988 In 1986 the economy grew by an actual 31 pct Inflation meanwhile is expected to stabilize at around the current four pct level over the next two years
19061	Japan could avoid a sharp rise in the value of the yen against the dollar if Japan the US And other nations succeeded in restructuring their economies an advisory panel to the governments Economic Planning Agency EPA said The advisory body said in its report that the yen would soar against the dollar if structural adjustments on a global basis were delayed An EPA official told Reuters the dollar could fall to slightly below 100 yen by 1993 if Japan and the US Failed to restructure their economies The dollars fall without structural adjustments would cut Japans current account surplus to two pct of gross national product GNP in 1993 the report said It said such a change would slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annually during the seven-year period to 1993 If the two nations restructured their economies the dollar would remain stable in real terms while reducing Japans current-account surplus to 21 pct of GNP in 1993 This scenario put Japans GNP growth at 35 pct a year It forecast real growth of three pct for the world economy and four pct for Japan by 2000 if the adjustments were made
19075	South Africa recorded annualised real growth in GDP of 325 pct in the first quarter of this year and the economy should achieve the governments target of three pct growth for 1987 the Reserve Bank said The South African central bank said in its quarterly bulletin that confidence in the economy improved from January to May 31 because of the higher gold price a rise in the nations gold and foreign currency reserves and an improvement in the rands exchange rate to just under 50 US Cents It noted the growth rate had slowed from 45 pct in the third and fourth quarters of last year It also cited a three year debt recheduling agreement reached with international creditors in March as evidence of improved foreign perceptions of the South African economy The accord effectively extends a moratorium on most repayments of 13 billion dlrs of South Africas short term foreign debt Total foreign debt is 23 billion dlrs South Africa recorded a seasonally adjusted annualised surplus on the current account of the balance of payments of 743 billion rand in the first quarter compared with a surplus of 724 billion rand in 1986 The bank said it was the ninth consecutive current account surplus since the start of 1985
19478	The economy faces lackluster growth and the risk of recession this year if the recent improvement in US exports should falter economists say Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness in the key housing and auto sectors and could be further hampered unless consumer spending picks up they say These factors raise the question Is there enough strength to keep the economy from tipping into a recession said Lyle Gramley chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association and a former Federal Reserve Board official The Commerce Department said this week that the economy grew by a robust 48 pct annual rate in the first quarter but a US monetary official called it a weak report Housing starts fell 27 pct in May and consumer spending rose a weak 01 per cent Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing --are faltering but exports are picking up some of the slack  Martin Mauro senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics told Reuters Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slow because inflation is rising faster than real wages To offset this US exports must continue to rise returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boost personal income and consumption he says I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports to keep a recession from happening but it is a close call Gramley said Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reporters that the apparent strength in the 48 pct growth figure was the result of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not last and said the recovery was showing anemia Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along The pace of the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored into monetary policy - possibly a signal that the Fed will be accommodative Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pct forecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that if the dollar drops suddenly higher inflation will result and add to the risk of a recession Mauro said a 05 pct rise in industrial production in May came despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry where an inventory overhang still exists He says the boost in production came from smaller industries like paper chemicals and lumber which have improved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge in economic activity but I think they will keep us out of a recession Mauro said In a speech to financial planners this week Beryl Sprinkel the chief White House economic adviser predicted the trade deficit will continue to improve Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 and into 1988 are still quite favorable he said But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence in inflation Allen Sinai chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 45 to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 after a 11 pct increase in 1986 The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar higher oil and energy prices and rising prices for services he said The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie gets out of the bottle it continues to persist he said adding he would like the Fed to tighten credit A major factor affecting inflation is the value of the dollar which should continue to fall and feed inflation says a prominent international banker Rainer Gut chairman of Credit Suisse told the National Press Club that the dollars downward trend against the yen and the mark will continue for years because the United States is the worlds largest debtor nation The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to a further slackening of activity and called naive the belief that the five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever It is very difficult to be optimistic Gut said
21368	The Soviet Union outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday stressing the need to improve standards in the countrys sluggish engineering industry Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told the Supreme Soviet industrial output should rise by 45 pct in 1988 up from a planned 44 pct in 1987 It rose 36 pct in Jan-Sept 1987 Talyzin said national income the nearest Soviet equivalent to gross national product should rise by 43 pct against a planned 41 pct this year Gross national product measures the output of a countrys goods and services He said the Kremlin planned to produce 235 mln tonnes of grain in 1988 versus a planned 232 mln this year Moscow produced 210 mln tonnes in 1986 Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described machine-builing as a sector whose rapid modernization is essential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively on world markets Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the machine-building industry The economy is not receiving a considerable amount of the equipment that it requires said Talyzin who heads the state planning committee GOSPLAN Soviet data show the machine-building industry which makes machine tools instruments and other engineering goods increased output by 33 pct in the first nine months of 1987 compared with the same period last year However this was far below the 73 pct increase planned for the industry for the whole of 1988 Talyzin said the ruling Politburo had concluded at a recent meeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to a large extent on conserving resources better Large-scale measures are planned to save resources he said Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet that defense spending in 1988 would total 32 billion dlrs the same figure as was announced last year Western governments view official Soviet estimates for defense spending as highly understated but say the real figure is hard to calculate because Soviet military industries are intertwined with the civilian economy Talyzin said the Kremlin also decided to increase spending next year on medical services education pensions and social insurance schemes

15893	The US Agriculture Department increased its estimate of 198687 grain purchases by the Soviet Union to 28 mln tonnes up two mln tonnes from last month In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation the USDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated because Soviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the last month USDA said the increased purchasing is somewhat surprising because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn USDA said Of the 28 mln tonnes total 15 mln tonnes will be wheat 12 mln tonnes coarse grains and the remaining one mln tonnes miscellaneous grains and pulses USDA said USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop suffered through a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed The severe winter is believed to have resulted in above average winter-kill USDA said Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter losses maybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buying grain recently USDA said Moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnes grain for delivery in 198687 including 14 mln tonnes wheat and 12 mln tonnes coarse grain

18614	US House and Senate budget negotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reached yesterday to cut 125 billion dlrs from fiscal 1988 spending on agricultural programs Congressional sources told Reuters The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 14 billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House The negotiators also agreed to cut 16 billion from the farm budget in fiscal 1989 and 245 billion in 1990 for a total of 53 billion in saving over three years sources said The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculture committees with difficult choices on how to make changes in agriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targets without jeopardizing popular support payments senior Congressional aides told Reuters Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to find the budget savings Rep Dan Glickman D-Kan Chairman of the House grains subcommittee has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat and corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 228 dlrs and 192 dlrs respectively saying it would save 500 mln dlrs House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza has said the committee will consider the Glickman proposal But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to be approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers and a strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who said freezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major grain export competitors and would not achieve the budget savings Glickman claims Another area where Glickman and other have said budget savings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program ARP levels for wheat and corn However on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong stand within the Reagan administration arguing that the 1988 crop wheat acreage reduction should be left at 275 pct and not 30 pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget OMB Most commodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail Congressional sources said the only way to achieve significant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boost the 1988 corn ARP But one informed Congressional source said singling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen as unfair to one commodity Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is most likely to eventually look for budget savings are some tightening of the payment limitation rules and possible adoption of a 092 program for the 1988 crops of major grains Those changes would achieve a portion of the 125 billion but not enough they said Ultimately Congressional sources said the agriculture committees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut on all Commodity Credit Corp payments to farmers including price support loans and deficiency payments similar to the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986 This idea has been suggested by the American Farm Bureau Federation AFBF as the fairest approach for all commodities

14890	Australian markets are booming as foreign fund managers redirect capital away from the United States and other traditional markets analysts said High short-term interest rates a bullish stock market and an increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of fresh funds in the last two months largely from Japanese and US Investors analysts polled by Reuters said Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in and have settled on Australia Britain and Canada as they diversify from volatile US Dollar instruments they said A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in the past month record share prices and a 10-month high for the currency of 071 US Dlrs all illustrated the inflow Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital are not available but brokers said they received almost daily inquiries from Japan and the United States These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about and they dont know what to do with it Some of that is ending up here with the attraction of high interest rates and reasonable currency stability National Australia Bank Ltd economist Brian Hamley said There is a flight to quality Hamley said Australia may not be in the best economic position but there arent too many other countries where youd want to put your money The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against the volatility of the US Unit analysts said Were looking a more favoured market than perhaps the US Where some people would be concerned about the value of the US Dollar Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose said Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap and the currency looks stable But turning that capital into more permanent productive investment depends on government economic policy he said It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the direction in the economy Buttrose said adding that offshore investors would carefully watch the governments promised tough economic statement on May 14 While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding interest unobtainable elsewhere fund managers could just as easily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese who were badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar and hefty jumps in bond rates analysts said It will remain very edgy money If something was not to be delivered if the statement wasnt considered tough enough one might see a substantial outflow Buttrose said Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and stubborn current account deficit analysts said They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think they would like to leave the money here Buttrose said Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased interest in investment in Australia and the need to shield Japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency policy when he said authorities could not take their eyes off the yen because of the crucial role of Japanese investors Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked successfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar within the range of 100 to 103 yen Apart from its recovery against a weak US Dollar the Australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a trade-weighted basis in the last three weeks Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming Australian share market It has followed Wall Street and other markets but is also setting its own trend in response to the weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into equities particularly in the gold sector The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 17583 today nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986 while the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 30810 in the same period The property sector is also sought after with Japanese companies that have invested heavily in the United States in recent years turning their attention to undervalued real estate particularly in the tourism field Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydneys five-star Regent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs as indicative of the type of property being sought They think they find good value real estate here which with long term and fixed capital investment is the kind of investment Australia needs Buttrose added

15212	The relatively high level of real US interest rates suggests that there is scope for further declines in money market rates but the Federal Reserve is unlikely to promote such a drop as long as the dollar remains volatile said JP Morgan and Co Inc chairman Lewis Preston He said in response to a reporters question after the banks annual meeting that money market rates could decline further but I dont think the Fed is going to encourage that as long as the exchange markets are as volatile as they are On the other hand he said that barring a collapse of the dollar he did not see rates going much higher He said that Morgans recent rise in its prime lending rate was purely a reflection of an increase in a whole spectrum of rates Preston reiterated earlier company forecasts that the US economy should show roughly 25 to three pct real growth this year He also said that as a consequence of the dollars decline and oil price rises inflation would rise moderately to a 35 to four pct rate in 1987
15310	The Federal Reserve will promote lower interest rates this year to sustain world economic growth First Boston Corp managing director Albert Wojnilower said As much as the Fed would like to take a tough line against inflation it cannot act to slow the growth of credit without subverting national US economic policy On selected occasions when the dollar seems steady and because the trade deficit is not responding the United States decided to push Germany and Japan harder to meet their commitments to economic growth the Federal Reserve will do its part by moving rates down Wojnilower said in a report Justifiably not anticipating either a recession or seriously higher interest rates securities market participants have seen little to fear Wojnilower said He said last weeks hiccup in money and currency rates and bond and stock prices was probably caused by Japanese window dressing for March 31 end-of-fiscal-year accounts Wojnilower said the US probably enjoyed above-average economic growth in the first quarter However the pick-up seems to reflect an unsustainable pace of inventory building and the prospect for the full year is still for real gross national product growth of about 2-12 pct he said
15364	Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler called on central banks of major industrialised nations to cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies In a lecture at the University of Surrey pre-released here Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was protectionism and control on capital movements Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have them he said He added that West German growth forecasts would have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop to 180 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987 Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets had parted company with transactions in goods services and investments It was the scale of speculative transactions that determined market trends Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to grow To reverse such a rise in the money stock interest rates would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off In other words the monetary policy measures required are different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity Koehler said The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive US Current account deficit But attempts to keep the depreciation going by talking the dollar down posed problems The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep rise in the cost of US Imports and a sharp fall in the cost of European imports But the volume effect of falling imports to the US And rising imports to Europe would take time to make itself felt compared with the price effect Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going further than would be necessary to adjust the current account over the medium term Koehler said A reduction in the US Current account deficit would occur only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand In Japan and West Germany by contrast domestic demand should rise faster than GNP In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986 Koehler said If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be prevented the US Current account deficit could be offset by an inflow of foreign funds into the US But only if there was an appropriate interest rate differential would Europe and Japan look for financial investment in the US When selecting monetary policy instruments a central bank had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market and its substantial impact on exchange rates It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of price stability economic growth and full employment but also to tackle international problems like the exchange rate problem the debt problem and the current account problem A strategy had to be designed that helped the safeguarding of non-inflationary economic growth in an international monetary system largely free of disruptions Koehler said Given the system of floating exchange rates it was necessary for central banks to agree to intervene It sufficed to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over the next few years and intervention points should not be set because they were only testing points for the market he said In order to keep the international monetary system free of disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but also cooperate on interest rate policies Koehler said

15384	Remarks by two leading central bankers sparked renewed speculation in financial markets that a cut in the West German three pct discount rate may be under discussion currency dealers said Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech that monetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflows required cuts in interest rates Separately West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall below its lowest ever point of 275 pct He made clear that he was not making a forecast on interest rates however Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollar gained slight background support from the speculation But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 380 pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the money market this week dashing some expectations that it may either offer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rate and let the strength of banks demands set the allocation rate It allocated 61 billion marks in new liquidity much less than the 149 billion leaving the market as a prior pact expired This further weakened sentiment the Bundesbank could move to a more accommodative monetary stance dealers said Koehler said in a speech in Surrey England speculative capital inflows may cause monetary growth regardless of whether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell In other words the monetary policy measures required are different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity Though Koehler was known to be the most liberal of the generally monetarist Bundesbank board his comments marked the first time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as a counterpoint to overly strong monetary growth dealers said REUTERM

15444	Remarks by central bankers raised some hopes the Bundesbank will cut rates on securities repurchase pacts but operators remained divided on the likelihood of a move in the near term money market dealers said Comments by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler yesterday that rate cuts were needed to curb money supply growth from speculative capital inflows and by West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss that there was no natural lower limit to the discount rate had however no immediate impact Call money declined to 36575 pct from 37585 pct but the drop was tied to extra liquidity in the market dealers said Dealers said the Bundesbanks latest liquidity allotment this week dashed some hopes of lower rates The Bundesbank allotted only 61 billion marks yesterday in new liquidity in a repurchase pact at an unchanged rate of 380 pct thus subtracting some 88 billion marks from the market as an outgoing 149 billion pact expired But some dealers said the smaller volume awarded by the pact was in line with present liquid money market conditions and did not exlude a cut in the repurchase pact rate soon to 370 pct if money market rates continue at present levels The next opportunity for the Bundesbank to lower rates on repurchase pacts will be in a tender expected next Tuesday Bundesbank officials have already said they favour more discreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts rather than the more public adjustment of leading rates The Bundesbank may either set a fixed allocation rate and allow banks to tender for the volume as has been the case since it lowered its discount rate January 22 or else it may allow banks to tender for the rate and set the volume itself Dealers expect volume of the tender to be lower than the 152 billion marks flowing out to offset other incoming funds Some seven billion marks is expected to flow in next week This should then flow back into the market as it is deposited with banks Banks were well supplied with liquidity holding 615 billion marks in reserves at the Bundesbank on Tuesday Holdings of average daily reserves over the first seven days of April stood at 596 billion marks still above the estimated 51 billion required for all of April
15539	The Bundesbank sees no current reason to change monetary course vice-president Helmut Schlesinger told Reuters in a telephone interview Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss which dealers said revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts may once again be under discussion Schlesinger said he had no comment on the remarks of his two central bank council colleagues But he added that the last central bank council meeting on April 2 had discussed the economic situation with a mood of subdued optimism particularly influenced by the news brought by several state central bank presidents Much is going better than the impression gained by the public from the January figures which have been in the meantime superseded he said German January industrial output fell 30 pct after a decline of 09 pct in December New industry orders fell 19 pct after they had been unchanged in December Bank economists said that the two together showed the economy would either stagnate or contract in the first quarter of 1987 Aside from the economic developments Schlesinger added a steady monetary course was important to hold the dollarmark rate around current levels as Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl had said while attending the Washington World BankIMF meeting Asked however if the Bundesbank could move to cut rates on repurchase agreements at the setting of the next repurchase tender due next Tuesday Schlesinger said Since the central bank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14 days this is hardly probable Responding to the question whether the Bundesbank had moved away from a policy of targetting monetary growth toward one of targetting currency rates Schlesinger said he could have no comment on the subject while negotiations were still in progress in Washington

15552	The head of Spains employers federation Jose Maria Cuevas said employers were worried about the governments monetary policies because high real interest rates were hampering investment He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far this year were not endangering the governments five pct inflation target The governments perceived need to control inflation by keeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary he said High real interest rates were attracting an influx of speculative foreign capital which was undercutting the governments target for monetary growth Cuevas said Spains most closely-watched measure of money supply liquid assets in public hands grew at an annualised rate of 17 pct in March against 114 pct in December last year and a target range of 65 to 95 pct for 1987 To combat this the Bank of Spain has raised its call money rate 14 times so far this year to 145 pct at present from 118 at end-1986 Cuevas said employers were heeding the governments call to hold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new wage pacts averaging 56 pct in the first quarter of 1987 These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish workers Cuevas said with the rest still in wage negotiations He said Spains current wave of strikes mainly affected the state sector where the government is trying to impose its five pct wage ceiling Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in Spains foreign trade balance The trade deficit in the first two months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas a 68 pct increase over the corresponding period last year However employers did not favour a devaluation of the peseta to correct the imbalance

15617	Nigel Lawson Britains Chancellor of the Exchequer said some countries may need to cut interest rates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Seven countries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago he said central banks would continue to intervene as and when necessary He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do more to stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday Lawson said he was still worried about  the risk of a simultaneous recession in the United States Japan and West Germany though less so than when he gave his March 17 budget speech to the British Parliament If anything Im a little bit less concerned but there is still a risk he said Asked if the United States should consider increasing interest rates to support the dollar he said If there is a need for changes in relative interest rates it doesnt need to be a rise in interest rates in the United States Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterdays meetings at the slow progress the United States had made in reducing its budget deficit We believe there will be some worthwhile progress in reducing the deficit this year The important thing is that it continue year after year Lawson said The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts to stabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates In the six weeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise against the dollar despite massive central bank intervention Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in the Louvre accord he said I dont think so If there had been no intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness Although intervention could be a cause of inflation Lawson said the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode  but one has to be vigilant He said yesterdays G-7 statement which affirmed that current levels of exchange rates were appropriate had been carefully worded We know what we mean and we all mean the same thing he said Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese measures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of weakness for that agreement Therefore the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawas presentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate domestic demand They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate increase in public works spending but Lawson said the package also involved a second stage to increase expenditures during the second half of this year

16053	Economists said that they doubt the Federal Reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar despite higher discount window borrowings in the latest two-week statement period and very heavy borrowings Wednesday Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged 393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday up from 265 mln dlrs in the prior statement period Wednesday borrowings were 14 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 645 pct One could make a case that the Fed is firming but it probably isnt said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policy modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the two-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months However the Dean Witter economist noted that the latest two-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand often pushes up borrrowings Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy but it looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions late in the statement period and didnt quite make it said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today that the Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs or more in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday Still McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed The Fed took no market reserve management action last Thursday and Friday the first two days of the week It added temporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves directly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday Based on Fed data out today economists calculated that the two-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on Tuesday totaled around 59 billion dlrs They put Wednesdays overnight System repos at approximately 34 billion dlrs It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy at this time said Larry Leuzzi of SG Warburg and Co Inc Citing the view shared by the other two economists Leuzzi said the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak economies in the United States and abroad and add to the financial stress of developing countries and their lenders Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the latest statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar tumbled said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new statement period began today on disappointment yesterdays Washington meetings of international monetary officials failed to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid In fact currency dealers said there was nothing in Wednesdays G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade imbalance between the United States and Japan The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming for steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average Fed funds rate between six and 6-18 pct This is about where the rate has been since early November Im not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighter policy to help the dollar as some suspect said Sullivan of Dean Witter If it is however he said that Fed probably has just nudged up its funds rate goal to around 625 to 635 pct from six to 610 pct previously
16072	Todays turmoil in the US Financial markets with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollars wake is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology that is likely to spell more turbulence ahead economists said For two years the markets had hailed the dollars decline as the cure-all for the US Trade deficit Interest rates fell sharply and Wall Street became a one-way street up But that confidence is now cracking as the financial markets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volckers often-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse Volckers been saying for a long time that a dollar freefall would be extremely dangerous - now hes got it said David Jones economist at Aubrey G Lanston and Co Inc The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in 40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances short of further depreciation of the dollar Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid worries that the dollars slide will rekindle inflation scare away foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12 dlrs to a 1987 high of 4322070 dlrs an ounce while the spike in interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down by 33 points to 2339 Norman Robertson Mellon Bank chief economist called the markets instability frightening He believes economic fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that once you start the ball rolling its difficult to stop Theres a stark possibility that you could get a destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates and drives us into recession The markets are in a panic Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics in Washington has been warning for a long time that the controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 347 marks and 264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare Were still more or less on track for a hard landing But the agony may be fairly drawn out Marris told Reuters Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this year but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it would take very little to touch off what he calls the second phase of the hard landing whereby a loss of confidence in the dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession The stock markets reaction today and its sharp drop on March 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with historical experience which teaches that domestic markets are not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its decline Marris said He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollars latest weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling below 150 yen the floor that the market believes was set as part of the G-7 Paris agreement in February Robertson at Mellon by contrast said the loss of confidence was triggered last week when Washington announced plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic imports raising the specter of a debilitating trade war Many economists believe that long-run stability will not return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is addressed - excessive consumption in the US Reflected in the massive budget deficit But in the short term given the failure of the G-7 and of central bank intervention some feel that the Fed will have no choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a substantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding cut abroad at least by Japan said Lanstons Jones Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest rates even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for American farmers Latin American governments and others But Robert Giordano chief economist at Goldman Sachs and Co scoffed at the notion Its ridiculous to think the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak against just one currency This is yen strength not dollar weakness he said Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being made toward reducing the US Budget deficit Were going to have one of the biggest reductions in the budget deficit relative to GNP in history this year and nobody cares he said noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69 will have been greater He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year But for now market psychology has changed so abruptly that a further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out Put on your helmets Giordano said

16565	Major US banks may lift prime lending rates again within days due to recent increases in their borrowing costs and speculation the Federal Reserve is nudging up interest rates to help the dollar economists said In what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984 most banks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to 7-34 pct citing a reduced gap between the prime and their own cost of money That spread has narrowed again A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct is justified because the spread between banks cost of funds and the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a percentage point He said that spread had averaged around 14 percentage points since last October until it fell below one point and triggered the April prime rate rise at most banks We could easily have another prime rate increase as soon as this week said David Jones of Aubrey G Lanston and Co Weve got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the near future said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp Based on the spread between the prime rate and funding costs you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now said Harold Nathan economist at Wells Fargo Bank However he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan demand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintain recent upward pressure on money market interest rates Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures lift short-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar He said if there is widespread belief money market rates will stay high a prime rate rise could occur at any time Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a dollar drop could help rekindle US inflation As the dollar fell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday currency traders said the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar In addition to buying dollars outright another way to stabilize the US currency would be for the Fed to push US interest rates higher relative to overseas rates Based particularly on the Feds reserve management actions on Friday and today Nathan of Wells Fargo said it has become clear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure in the market It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interest rates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculation that the Fed is gently firming monetary policy That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in the market than most economists had expected On Friday the Fed added reserves indirectly and in small amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements with the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another high at 6-516 pct With funds trading even higher at 6-12 pct today the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 15 billion dlr round of customer repurchase agreements The Feds actions on Friday and today show that it is offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures said Jones of Lanston The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the need to defend the dollar Jones said He believes it is merely shading policy toward restraint now but to have a major impact on the dollar the Fed will have to tighten policy overtly at some point Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and within four to six weeks to raise its discount rate from 5-12 pct Jones said a US discount rate increase to six pct might well be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to further aid the dollar Given likely Fed policy firming he said both the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds about 830 pct now and the prime rate may be at 8-12 pct at end-June and nine pct by years end The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening policy to defend the dollar said Leslie of Discount Corp He said tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressures abate will show whether or not it is firming policy

17620	A cut of about half a percentage point in Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect although economists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank encouraged by a strong guildermark relationship and wide premiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German might lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first Last month the Central Bank lowered its special advances rate to 51 pct from 525 pct after the Bundesbank dropped its repurchase tender rate to 355 pct from 38 pct That rate has remained in force just holding above the five pct official secured loans rate which governs commercial bank borrowings Given a strong guilder a further fall in the West German repo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff forcing an official Dutch rate cut analysts said In February when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate to three pct from 35 pct the Central Bank only lowered money market rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loans rate on lending under its three month credit quota Since then however both the Central Bank and Finance Ministry have made it clear they favour lower official rates In April Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said he would follow any Bundesbank cut and last week the Finance Ministry expressed satisfaction when it raised 225 billion guilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 10010 pct for an effective yield of 598 pct the lowest since 1965 Technically analysts said there has to be a difference between the secured loans rate which applies to lending under the credit quota and the tariff on special advances which add extra liquidity to the money market Bank economists and dealers said a West German move to further lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts would result in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate provided the guildermark relationship permitted The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around its parity value within the European Monetary System of 112673 guilders per 100 marks Today foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10 guilder cents to 112705 guilders per 100 at the fix a level that would not permit a change in the interest rate differential between West Germany and the Netherlands dealers said An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German and Dutch interest rates to ease in the short term However he said new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation expectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates in the longer term In the Netherlands the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil or even negative while the latest official economic forecasts point to a falling rate of economic growth It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement negotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation the ABN economist said He said Dutch money supply growth which ran at 34 pct in January could also contribute to some inflation At Amro Bank a leading analyst said inflation could run to two pct next year The bank expects Dutch capital market rates currently averaging around 61 pct to stop easing in the second half of this year and stabilize around 56 pct Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying spree on the bond market which would bring yields down probably only temporarily while money rates could fall below five pct Currently all periods are traded at 512 to 525 pct in the money market

17883	Bundesbank vice president Helmut Schlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now With money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down in May and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark Schlesinger told Reuters that he was not convinced that a further cut in interest rates was needed The economy is picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted 12 to one pct in the first quarter from the fourth he added We may have an increase in gnp starting in the second quarter he said in an interview Concerned by the first quarter downturn the US Has been pressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost its imports either through fiscal or monetary policy Schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was mainly due to adverse weather conditions just as occured in 1986 Year-on-year growth was thus about two pct He estimated that economic growth for the year as a whole would probably be between one and two pct It is not a question of monetary conditions if domestic demand does not grow strongly he said noting that interest rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money stock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year pace of 7-12 to eight pct well above the Bundesbanks three to six pct target He said the target could still be achieved but much will depend on the direction of long-term capital flows Heavy inflows particularly in January around the time of the EMS revaluation boosted domestic money supply There is still a certain hope that the net inflow of foreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bit reversed Schlesinger said A major reason for the inflows was the markets conviction that the mark was headed higher As we can see from the market expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark have diminished Schlesinger said The recent widening of interest rate differentials the fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined towards stabilizing the dollar he said Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollar rise as the US Did in March when the dollar rose above 187 marks he said this would depend on the circumstances At midday here the dollar stood at 1834045 marks Central banks are always in contact about these fluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react Schelsinger said One has to look at how it the market is moving he said adding It is not only our own case it is also the American case He said that the West German export industry has been hit hard by the dollars sharp fall and would probably like to see some correction now But it wouldnt be good to have short-term fluctuations he said Let us wait and see It is mainly the strength of the dollar fall in a very short period which was a little bit of a shock than the level of rates as such Schlesinger said The sharp rise of the mark coupled with weak prices of such key commodities as oil had a favourable impact on West German inflation down year Although there have recently been signs of inflation picking up he said that this was due to changes in key commodity prices The underlying inflation rate this year would be unchanged at about one to 1-12 pct he said Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth was longer term in that the economy was building up the potential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation The above-target growth of money supply over the past 16 months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of targets themselves a matter which might be taken up at the mid-year meeting of the Bundesbanks council Schlesigner said But he added I dont see any great pressure to go away from it

17966	The record 49 billion dlrs rise in UK Reserves in May to a total 347 billion has lifted hopes for a further cut in bank base lending rates after the June 11 general election market analysts said Sterling would have risen on the much better than expected number but for market nerves about the poll outcome they said But the weight of foreign currency and gold reserves now available to the authorities to support the pound should curb any market tendency to panic if UK Opinion polls show the ruling Conservative Partys lead slipping they added We have been intervening to a very much greater extent than we have done hitherto Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said at a news conference today commenting on the news of the record reserves rise He put the UK Intervention in the context of the Louvre accord between leading industrial nations to stabilise the dollar partly through direct intervention on foreign exchanges We have been playing a very full part ourselves he said But market analysts see the recent upward pressure on sterling and consequent need for official sales to damp down its rise more in the light of local factors Steven Bell chief economist at Morgan Grenfell Securities said that corporate money has been flowing back into Britain amid hopes of another Conservative government after fears last autumn of a Labour election victory sent it flooding out UK Portfolio investment is also returning while foreign buyers see UK Growth propects and high bond yields as attractive They will be strong buyers of UK Assets notably equities once the election is out of the way Bell said Analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lower interest rates as the government is expected to try to reverse the loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound Today however the pound hardly moved on the reserves news dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket of currencies from 731 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 GMT to 730 pct at 1100 GMT half an hour after the figures were released The market doesnt want to do anything because of the election commented an economist at a big US Investment bank Several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts of a rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs had overestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely to have been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on the forward market The market also seemed to have overestimated the amount of sterling the Bank of England bought at the end of May to smooth the pounds sudden downturn while some of the intervention reported in May probably occurred in April they said The key three months interbank money market rates eased about 18 point reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrend in UK Interest rates will be revived following the reserves news analysts said Government bond prices initially firmed but the market was muted as traders worried about the funding implications of another huge rise in reserves they added Morgan Grenfells Bell forecast a half point base rate cut from the current nine pct level soon after the election so long as poll projections of another Conservative victory prove accurate with another half point later Justin Silverton equity economist at Credit Suisse Buckmaster and Moore said a full point reduction might be possible Sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts in future rather than this active intervention he predicted Kevin Boakes of Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged cautioned against over-optimistic forecasts but agreed a half point cut looked likely A cut before the election has been virtually ruled out The Bank of England is both worried about the political problem of cutting rates during an election campaign  And has signalled some worry about broad money growth said Robin Marshall chief UK Economist at Chase Manhattan Securities He said the 10 billion dlrs increase in total reserves in the past seven months may foreshadow full UK Entry into the European Monetary System But Bell said the authorities would like to see another 10 or 15 billion dlrs in the reserves before joining if they did so But unlike many analysts he doubted the UK Will go in

18086	The Bundesbank is unlikely to change credit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursday for its last session before the Venice summit banking economists and money market dealers said The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts and is unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates in the near future they said The council will meet in Saarbruecken and the meeting will be followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was usually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt and did not necessarily herald any policy moves Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger said today there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply growth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar was stable against the mark Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo where the Bundesbank has opened a representative office that the West German economy was now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted 12 to one pct in the first quarter Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in a 35070 pct range for most of this month after the Bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a minimum bid rate of 350 pct allocating funds at 355 pct They have set this signal and indicated they could maybe lower market rates even further but not with the discount or Lombard Winfried Hutmann chief economist of Schroeder Munchmeyer Hengst Investment GmbH said Werner Chrobok managing partner at Bethmann Bank said German rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and around historical lows for West Germany A further cut in rates would have little impact on the economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand with companies swimming in liquidity Chrobok said The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move on interest rates when this would be better held in reserve The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder he said A cut in the discount or Lombard rates to bring them in line with the new structure of money market rates since last month would have little practical significance dealers said The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a diplomatic gesture before next weeks Venice summit But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made it clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere eyewash Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government to cut taxes rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetary policy to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced tax cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget deficit it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further The Bonn government will be in a very weak position in Venice because they cant risk increasing the deficit further said Schroeder Muenchmeyer Hengsts Hutmann Bethmanns Chrobok said if anything is to happen before Venice it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy But I dont expect any convincing measures he said Money market dealers noted that call money continued to normalize today falling to 36070 pct from 37585 yesterday and as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up by month-end distortions Call money could come under upwards pressure later this month because of a major round of tax payments by banks on behalf of customers starting in the week beginning June 15 Two public holidays that week could also distort the market Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate funds tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 355 pct after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 350 pct and to fully replace the 55 billion marks in an outgoing pact But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank would allocate funds at 36 pct rather than 355 That would not represent a tightening of policy however Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates at the minimum accepted rate some banks may try to get a full allocation by bidding heavily at 36 pct dealers said On another issue Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely to lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency Unit ECU at one of its meetings soon Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement on this gesture to European unity as it is the capital of the Saarland bordering France and was twice under French occupation this century But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come this week as a number of technical and legal matters had still to be resolved for instance how German ECU accounts would be treated for minimum reserve purposes
18142	Paul Volckers decision not to go for a third term as Federal Reserve Chairman and the nomination of Alan Greenspan to replace him have revived deep concerns about the US ability to prevent a further dollar decline and stem rising inflation financial market analysts said Although Greenspan is known as a committed anti-inflation fighter in the Volcker mould doubts are already surfacing in the US financial markets as to whether he has enough political clout and monetary experience to wage a tough campaign against inflation over the next year or two The critical issue is how Greenspan will deal with inflation said Stephen Axilrod Vice Chairman of Nikko Securities Co International Inc and former staff director for monetary and financial policy at the Fed A lot of questions have been raised by Volckers departure Until Greenspan answers them the markets will remain nervous added Stephen Slifer money market economist at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc This mornings announcement sent the dollar into a tailspin which was halted only by concerted central bank intervention in the open currency market
18185	Henry Kaufman managing director of Salomon Brothers Inc said the nomination of economist Alan Greenspan to replace Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker is bearish in the near term for the fixed income and currency markets The basic direction of interest rates is not changed The fundamental direction of interest rates continues to be upward interrupted by intermittent rallies Kaufman said in a statement He said the implication for equity markets in neutral to bullish Kaufman said Unlike Paul Volcker who entered the office of the Federal Reserve chairman with strong credibility both domestically and internationally Mr Greenspan will have to demonstrate both his competence and policy independence before he can gain full confidence of the financial markets Greenspan is most knowledgeable on the behavior of the US economy while his professional skills in the international area are much more limited Kaufman noted Consequently although he is well known abroad his views on issues such as the Less Developed Country Debt may initially carry less weight than have those of Mr Volcker

18672	Todays UK Economic data have pushed the chances of another base lending rate cut from the current nine pct further into the distance analysts said A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturing production data showed that the economy is still strong and does not need a fillip from lower rates News that underlying earnings are rising 775 pct annually taken together with higher than expected bank lending and money supply growth revived inflation worries and monetarist arguments against easier credit they said The timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed back all the while The strength of the economy and broad money growth are making it more difficult to see one in the near term said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterdays mortgage rate cuts for new borrowers which building societies said were a sign of the expected near term trend for UK Rates It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week that a post-general election cut was imminent supported by such optimistic economic news as Mays record reserves rise which mirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterlings strength The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasm about Mays 64300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate to 295 mln or 106 pct of the workforce was rapidly replaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlying average earnings in April dealers said The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lending rose 27 billion stg in May above forecast and that the Bank of England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offset the impact on domestic money supply of its current intervention The gilt market reaction was correct said Bill Martin chief UK Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew Thats very important  It shows the economy in a very good state indeed Skeoch said Theres no reason to get worries about inflationary pressures because theyre very subdued Unit wage cost rises were better than expected just one pct higher in the year to April and it was these costs rather than average earnings which were potentially inflationary he added I dont think these average earnings numbers are a major problem agreed Chase Manhattans Marshall But he said the gilts market was likely to remain worried about the funding implications of recent intervention He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assets earlier this year attracted by growth prospects and hopes that the ruling Conservatives would win last weeks election now looks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities try to prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system However David Owen UK Economist at Kleinwort Grieveson Securities said any fresh sterling strength would still trigger a base rate cut and that todays figures did not signal higher inflation this year Wage increases are being offset by productivity growth As long as that continues were okay he added

19167	Bank of England governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton said lowering interest rates too fast could jeopardise recent economic achievements in the UK In remarks prepared for delivery to businessmen in Birmingham he said prospective returns on real investment are more favourable relative to those on financial assets than for a good number of years It would surely be foolish to put that favourable conjuncture at risk by lowering interest rates prematurely or excessively he said We might enjoy a short-term boost to activity but at the risk of a damaging return to the uncertainty and acrimony of high inflation he added Leigh-Pemberton said he recognised there are some who would argue that interest rates are still too high and deter investment in industry But we should not forget that less than a year ago we were intervening to support sterling and had some temporary difficulty in persuading the markets that a one pct increase in base rates to 11 pct was a sufficient tightening of policy at the time he added Base rate is currently nine pct
19191	More UK Lenders are offering homebuyers fixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes the same monthly payment no matter what happens to other interest rates And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in years the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers trying to lock into cheap money The decision to offer fixed rate loans industry officials said reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home mortgage business While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the UK They were the mainstay of the business in the US Up until only a few years ago But in the early 1980s interest rates soared US Lenders mostly savings and loan associations were earning rates as low as three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to induce them to retain their accounts As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were forced to merge The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose rates would move in line with the cost of funds We very much have the example of the US Thrifts in mind said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society explaining why his institution for the time being is only offering variable rate mortgages The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders concede they are being forced to undercut each other still more Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier this week by the nations two largest building societies and by National Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition for new business officials at all three institutions said The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even below those on the variable rate loans Of course they are less profitable than other variable rate mortgages said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc which earlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate new mortgage loans But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable loans because It was just another way to attract people to our mortgage product Trustee Savings Bank Plc TSB was offering five year fixed rate mortgages at 99 pct earlier this year The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans was exhausted within just a few days according to a spokeswoman Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage she said noting that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct of its 1986 volume In short the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest rates If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the lender is earning an above average return on assets But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won the benefit of cheap money Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed rate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumption that a Conservative Party victory would help money market rates fall further according to Duncan Young managing director Young explained that the company had planned to protect itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a complicated hedging instrument But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations and the company has shelved its plans for the time being He said money market rates were too high to arrange both the mortgages and hedge profitably However he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them This means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond and selling them to an investor For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate mortgages In the US Where fixed rate mortgages are popular again securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money over the past few years

19483	The six basis point rise of the past month in US debt futures may be extended next week by a series of US economic reports analysts said as long as the dollar holds firm Interest rates have declined by approximately 50 basis points over the last month largely over indications that inflation is not as high as people had feared and the narrowing US trade balance in nominal terms Samuel Kahan chief financial economist with Kleinwort Benson Government Securities said Kahan said recent government reports have shown strength in the economy during the first quarter but his concern is whether the US economy will sustain that strength in the longer term Weak US economic growth could hurt the dollar which has become more important to the direction of debt futures than the beneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy The median trade expectations for Tuesdays US Consumer Price Index and Durable Goods reports are up 04 pct and down 15 pct respectively Meanwhile the eight billion dlr drop in the M-1 money supply announced this week was surprising much larger than expected according to Kahan Unless quickly reversed such a trend will ensure that June M-1 growth will be negative Kahan said Taken in conjunction with M-2 and M-3 aggregates which Kahan said have slowed to a crawl below Federal Reserve Board annual targets the consequences could be a hint of economic weakness down the road he said Based on chart formations T-bond futures may be poised for further gains although the advance has been slowed recently analysts said September T-bonds are up almost six points since about May 18 Merrill Lynch debt analyst Jim Duggan noted September bond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93 in mid-June Duggan said While follow-through buying has aided the advance so far and bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide through chart support the rally in September T-bonds has been thwarted above the 93 level The 93 level is formidable resistance and must be taken out before this activity is anything other than a trading range market Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures debt analyst Brian Singer said The dollar remains the key fundamental factor and the US currency has made little headway of late analysts said The critical variable remaining in the market is the value of the dollar Kahan said Additional influences next week will be possible developments ahead of an OPEC members meeting and the impact and size of the US budget deficit although these will not be in the forefront of the market early next week Kahan said In looking ahead to the US Treasury mini-refunding auctions of 2425 billion in T-notes on Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday Singer said the market will likely greet the results with little excitement However a successful auction could prove to be a turning point depending on prevailing market psychology
19511	The Bank of Japan bought 100 billion yen in certificates of deposit CDs via repurchase agreements today to show its determination to maintain an easy money policy central bank officials said Todays CD buying operation was designed to seek an announcement effect in which we would reassure the market of the fact that we have not changed our policy stance a senior central bank official told Reuters The bank also bought 400 billion yen in two-month commercial bills to smooth out tight credit conditions in the interbank market today the officials said The central bank was concerned about growing market expectations of higher interest rates which were in part responsible for the recent plunge in stock and yen bond prices the officials said But money traders said the market generally shrugged off the banks CD operation because it was small and at a rate far below prevailing market rates The rate on the key three-month CDs in the primary market was 40800 pct while the banks bid was 375 pct they said The banks bill buying operation also had little impact because it was regarded as a routine operation they said The money traders said they regarded the central banks CD buying operation as simply a gesture to live up to Japans pledge to guide interest rates lower and stimulate the economy We did not expect the central bank to ease its credit grip any further a bank manager said adding that the prevailing market expectation of higher rates will remain If this is the case the three-month CD rate will stay above four pct for the time being he said

19557	Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said West Germany would be badly advised to lower interest rates and that he believed the economy would continue to recover after a six-month lull Asked by the newspaper Bild am Sonntag if lower interest rates could boost the domestic economy Poehl said We would be badly advised if we forced further interest rate cuts This could under certain circumstances release new inflationary fears which would then be more likely to lead to higher interest rates he added Poehl said Germany had practically no growth in the past six months because of the marks surge and the cold winter But since April statistics clearly show that the economy finds itself on a course of growth he said I expect this development to continue in the coming months Asked about his expectations of a US-European Community trade war Poehl said such an event would be disastrous For this reason we in Europe must avoid everything used by protectionist forces in the US As pretexts he added This includesEliminating existing restrictions in the EC as far as possible Protectionism is not found only in the US

20048	Plunging Tokyo stock prices will prevent the Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could even force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues government and private economists said A rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark further selling of shares that could ultimately have a major deflationary impact on the real economy they said Although Bank of Japan officials have consistently maintained that they had no plans to raise the 25 pct discount rate many in the markets have thought otherwise Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the central banks apparent decision last week to countenance higher rates on commercial bills dealers said But todays stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15 pct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed to raise the discount rate now despite its concerns about a renewed outbreak of inflation dealers and economists said Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the markets concluded that the stock markets collapse precluded the central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discount rate increase A senior government economist suggested that both the US And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a further drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices They need to support the stock and security markets he said But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to change policy for the moment although one admitted that the central bank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock prices continue to plunge during the rest of the week Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed the economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago With the economy recovering strongly the steep drop in stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and business confidence one government economist said There will be some impact on the real economy but it wont be that big said another Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their own although they do participate through trust funds and other investment vehicles And while many manufacturing firms turned to financial market investments for profits during last years economic downturn the recent rebound has allowed them to refocus their attention on their core businesses he said Paradoxically it is the pick-up in the economy that is partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have shifted funds away from financial investments to increase inventories and step up capital spending one government economist said In deciding what response to make to the steep stock price drop the Bank of Japan must first determine whether prices will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation one central bank official said That will at least take a couple of days if not weeks he said

21508	Karl Otto Poehl head of West Germanys central bank and Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg are normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the central banks independence But a rare public row between the ebullient Poehl president of the Bundesbank and Stoltenberg over a controversial investment tax proposal has added to the woes of the countrys already nervous financial markets bankers said Poehl told an investment symposium in Frankfurt last Thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and interest rates Stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting Poehls criticism saying West Germany would remain an attractive place for foreign investors The obvious lack of coordination between the Bundesbank and Finance Ministry does not instil confidence in foreign investors said one economist for a London broker who asked not to be identified Bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial policy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship to steer the economy through a particularly difficult time There are plenty of objective pressures which will result in things getting back to normal again after a period of ill feeling said Commerzbank AG chief economist Juergen Pfister News on October 9 that the government was planning a 10 pct withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in a market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and abroad Bankers said the Bundesbank was angered by the way the finance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting the Bundesbank adequately and allowing apparently conflicting details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market Both Poehl 57 and Stoltenberg 59 have been under extraordinary pressures lately Poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his deputy Helmut Schlesinger jacking up interest rates to fight inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had pursued so far this year to promote currency stability In recent statements Poehl has sounded more like Schlesinger For years the softly-spoken economist has been warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply growth would eventually lead to rising prices Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbank council and since late summer Poehl has had to represent his views bankers said Poehl is in a minority in his own house said Commerzbanks Pfister Poehl is in a dilemma He must follow a policy that is not entirely his own said another economist The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far they will attract funds into the country pushing up the mark and hurting West German exporters The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the Bundesbanks new tack became clear in early October Since last Thursday United States Treasury Secretary James Baker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986 war of words between the US And West Germany in which US Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany to stimulate its economy and thus suck in more US Exports One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a round of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990 But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for Stoltenberg than he had bargained for The cool unflappable northerner who was regularly voted most popular government politician last year had to face resistance from local barons in the government coalition parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising 43 billion marks But it has caused an outcry among bankers who say it will push up borrowing costs The extra amount this costs the government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row which has turned into the countrys worst political scandal Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington last month early to sort out a row in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein where he heads the ruling CDU party The states CDU premier Uwe Barschel had to resign after allegations of a dirty tricks election campaign led to heavy losses for the CDU in state elections Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva last weekend Police say the death appears to have been suicide Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the more remarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats and was appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt When Poehls contract came up for renewal earlier this year Chancellor Helmut Kohls CDU-led coalition government gave Poehl another eight-year term Werner Chrobok managing partner at Bethmann Bank said he hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again But when Poehl criticized Stoltenbergs tax plans he was not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the Bundesbanks independence of government Chrobok said

16158	The five leading West German economic research institutes have failed to agree about how strongly the domestic economy will expand this year but revised down forecasts contained in a report published six months ago The three research groups of Kiel Hamburg and Essen predicted in the institutes joint spring report that gross national product GNP would rise by two pct in 1987 compared with 24 pct in 1986 The five institutes had jointly forecast three pct 1987 growth in October last year Taking a dissenting view the DIW institute of West Berlin and Munichs Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth The joint report said that the estimates of economic development made by the DIW and Ifo were markedly less favourable than those of the other three The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a slow start to the year In the second half of 1987 there will however only be a weak upward movement they said The two institutes said external economic factors which were currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would dominate the economic environment throughout the year They saw exports falling by a real 2-12 pct in 1987 and predicted no marked improvement in the course of the year The other three institutes however wrote The decline in demand and production seen in the winter months does not indicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate uncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans But they expected that many investments had not been cancelled but only put off It can be presumed that the braking actions on the economy will diminish markedly this year They added The domestic prerequisites for a continuation of the economic uptrend are still favourable These three institutes said diminishing external burdens combined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in demand and production could be expected by the spring However this projection was clouded by risks including the further development of the mark against the dollar Contrary to the DIW and Ifo the three institutes said that while exports would continue to be the weak point of the economy in 1987 there is good reason to believe that exports will soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during the course of the year They predicted an overall 05 pct fall in exports in 1987 the same as in 1986 The three more positive institutes saw private consumption rising by four pct in 1987 compared with 42 pct in 1986 while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase They saw the climate for equipment investment improving but predicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 46 pct in 1986 Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in unemployment The Kiel Hamburg and Essen institutes said the jobless total would average 217 mln in 1987 compared with 223 mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in work of about 200000 These three institutes said new jobs would be created mainly in the private services sector and also by the state in the context of job creation measures The construction industry was likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980 but they predicted either no rise in employment in the manufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur only in the tertiary sector while the number employed in the manufacturing industry will decline The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to 220 mln in 1987 from 223 mln in 1986 They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58 billion marks from 78 billion in 1986 The other three saw a current account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marks and predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around 100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986 The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start to rise in 1987 after they declined in 1986 and all five predicted an average increase over the year of 05 pct

18672	Todays UK Economic data have pushed the chances of another base lending rate cut from the current nine pct further into the distance analysts said A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturing production data showed that the economy is still strong and does not need a fillip from lower rates News that underlying earnings are rising 775 pct annually taken together with higher than expected bank lending and money supply growth revived inflation worries and monetarist arguments against easier credit they said The timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed back all the while The strength of the economy and broad money growth are making it more difficult to see one in the near term said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterdays mortgage rate cuts for new borrowers which building societies said were a sign of the expected near term trend for UK Rates It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week that a post-general election cut was imminent supported by such optimistic economic news as Mays record reserves rise which mirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterlings strength The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasm about Mays 64300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate to 295 mln or 106 pct of the workforce was rapidly replaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlying average earnings in April dealers said The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lending rose 27 billion stg in May above forecast and that the Bank of England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offset the impact on domestic money supply of its current intervention The gilt market reaction was correct said Bill Martin chief UK Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew Thats very important  It shows the economy in a very good state indeed Skeoch said Theres no reason to get worries about inflationary pressures because theyre very subdued Unit wage cost rises were better than expected just one pct higher in the year to April and it was these costs rather than average earnings which were potentially inflationary he added I dont think these average earnings numbers are a major problem agreed Chase Manhattans Marshall But he said the gilts market was likely to remain worried about the funding implications of recent intervention He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assets earlier this year attracted by growth prospects and hopes that the ruling Conservatives would win last weeks election now looks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities try to prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system However David Owen UK Economist at Kleinwort Grieveson Securities said any fresh sterling strength would still trigger a base rate cut and that todays figures did not signal higher inflation this year Wage increases are being offset by productivity growth As long as that continues were okay he added

18990	Italys economic outlook for 1987 and 1988 is likely to be less favourable than last year with slightly lower growth higher unemployment and an increased trade deficit the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD said But the OECD in its half-yearly report forecast a slightly lower inflation rate over the next two years Last year Italy ranked as one of the OECDs fastest growing economies with Gross Domestic Product GDP growth at 27 pct The OECD said Italys GDP may grow by three pct in 1987 but will then fall back to 25 pct in 1988 The inflation rate will probably stabilise at around five pct during the projection period as a result of a turnaround in import prices particularly oil an acceleration in labour costs and the effects of domestic demand pressure the report said This year and to a lesser degree in 1988 domestic demand should be stimulated by buoyant growth in household consumption made possible by wage increases following pay negotiations Domestic demand pressure coupled with the deterioration in Italian competitiveness is likely to stimulate imports and adversely affect exports in 1987 and 1988 This could result in a sharp negative contribution to the currrent account
18993	Economic growth will remain sluggish in the Netherlands and Belgium next year and unemployment may rise the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast Belgiums GDP growth may slow down to 15 pct this year and next year bringing a rise in the number of jobless the OECD said in its semi-annual survey Belgian inflation could stabilise at 15 to 20 pct while the current account surplus will probably remain large at about three pct of GDP While the Belgian government has made progress in trimming its borrowing requirement it will probably be insufficient to check the self-sustaining nature of the deficit the OECD said In the Netherlands real GDP growth will also slip to 15 pct this year and one pct in 1988 with Dutch exports becoming less competitive and imports rising Employment is forecast to decelerate as well reflecting more sluggish growth in the private sector and budgetary cuts the report said Dutch consumer prices are set to fall by 05 pct in 1987 and stay stable in 1988 partly as a result of declining domestic gas prices Luxembourgs economy by contrast will see slightly faster growth in GDP this year as a result of an upward movement in wages But real growth in consumption will ease next year
18996	The United States should take urgent action to cut its crippling budget deficit including possible reductions in non-defense spending higher taxes and curbs on growth of the defense budget the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said The OECD in its semi-annual review of the world economy said a failure of the Reagan Administration and Congress quickly to agree on measures to cut the deficit could seriously affect confidence both in the United States and elsewhere It predicted that the federal deficit in fiscal 1987 running until September 30 this year would substantially overshoot both the Balanced Budget Acts target of 144 billion dlrs and official US Estimates in February of 175 billion The OECD projection which is based on assumptions of slower growth higher interest rates and actual data for the first half of the financial year is for a deficit of about 190 billion dollars it said While this would be 30 billion lower than last years deficit much of the improvement would be due to corporate tax increases being introduced before income tax cuts take effect The US Economic growth rate is expected to edge up to 275 pct next year from 25 pct this year and last In contrast to the last two years more competitive exports boosted by the fall in the dollar should help GNP growth Unemployment should continue to fall slowly as the service sector continues to create jobs But inflation appears to be heading higher partly due to the lower dollar with consumer prices forecast to rise four pct this year and 45 pct next year after just 21 pct in 1986 Monetary and fiscal policy appear to be the key factors behind the avoidance of recession the report said The current account balance of payments deficit is expected to be still around a high 125 billion dlrs next year after hitting a projected record 14725 billion this year it said In Canada economic growth is expected to pick up slightly to around 275 pct in 1988 from 25 pct this year but will still be below levels seen in recent years Inflation is expected to slow to 35 pct next year from 375 pct this year unemployment should edge down to nine pct in 1988 from 925 pct this year Canadas current account deficit is projected to shrink to around four billion US Dlrs this year and to remain at about that level in 1988

20462	The United States is prepared to pull out all the stops to defend its agricultural trade rights under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade GATT US Ambassador to GATT Michael Samuels said Those rights are now being challenged by the European Communitys EC agricultural support policies he told a conference sponsored by the American Soybean Association He reiterated Washingtons firm intention to retaliate if the EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef without the issue being investigated by a GATT special committee The US claims the EC directive due to come into effect on January 1 threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of US meat shipments into the EC The US also will oppose all EC efforts to impair US trade via the EC oilseeds regime which supports EC oilseed prices over the current market level and which may be extended to include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax Samuels said Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral trade negotiations is meaningless if import barriers continue to be erected Samuels said Samuels called the US plan to eliminate world farm subsidies by the year 2000 proposed at GATT in July visionary and very serious  The EC and Japan have said it is unrealistic The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposal on farm trade reform expected to be tabled at GATT formally next week The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reduce tensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals substitutes dairy and sugar It also calls for reduction of farm subsidies The US Is not opposed to short-term measures as long as they are directly linked to long-term commitments to end major trade distortions Samuels said Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formally submitted and respond to it officially then We will consider its relation to the Punta del Este declaration to correct trade problems and expand market access the US Ambassador said The US can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignores the US plan when it tables its own proposal he added The key difference between the two approaches is that the US wants farm subsidies eliminated while the EC is pushing only for a reduction in farm suppports Samuels said If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze there would be little incentive for the Community to work to correct the international trade situation he added Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint the EC oilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports to third countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the US wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT

17670	A trade bill before the United States House of Representatives is a very dangerous bill for Canadian industry Canadian Forest Industry Council chairman Adam Zimmerman told reporters By changing the definition of subsidy under US countervailing duty law House of Representatives Bill 3 removes protection for companies that take advantage of widely used government programs Zimmerman told a media briefing Clearly any industry to which Canadian governments grant rights to fish mine cut timber or produce power could be vulnerable to a finding of a subsidy under this language he said The Canadian forest lobbys Zimmerman also said the House of Representative Bill would adopt a new way of measuring subsidies that would greatly increase the size of any countervailing duties that might be imposed on Canadian resource exports to the US Under the bill any difference between Canadian prices and US or world market prices would constitute a subsidy he said Such a method would make Canadian resource industries vulnerable to similar penalties like a 15 pct export tax imposed last January on shipments of Canadian softwood lumber to the US Zimmerman added Canadian negotiators agreed to levy the new tax if a US forest industry lobby would drop its request for a countervail duty on imports of Canadian softwood lumber We represent the first victim of the move to price other countries natural resources according to the US system Zimmerman said If were an example than other resource industries had better watch out he added Zimmerman said the Canadian Forest Industry Council plans to discuss concerns about the US trade bill with lobby groups from other Canadian resource industries

16146	A major animal feed producer Cehave NV Veghel CHV has begun legal proceedings against the application of the European Community grain co-responsibility levy with the full backing of the Dutch animal grain and feed trade association Het Comite association chief executive Peter Pex told Reuters Oral proceedings were held in the Hague on Friday and the court said it would give its verdict within six weeks However that is the normal wording and we expect the Hague court to refer questions on the interpretation and application of the levy to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg Pex added Het Comite claims the way the levy is applied does not take account of currency cross-rates of exchange and can mean a compounder in one country being asked to pay a higher levy in its own national currency than it received down the chain from the original producer of the grain We would like the Business Administration Court in the Hague to ask the Luxembourg Court of Justice not only whether the Dutch Grain Commodity Board the levy collection agency has interpreted the levy regulations correctly but also whether the regulations themselves may contravene European law Pex said It is only with great regret that we have taken this route but we have had no political help and therefore have no option even though it could take years Pex added Het Comite asked CHV to act as a test case against the grain levy because the bill the company received from the commodity board included grain from a wide variety of origins and was therefore considered to be the best general basis for a legal challenge to the levy Pex noted Het Comites actions will run in tandem with questions on the levy already posed to the Luxembourg Court in a case brought by the Association of European Animal Feed Manufacturers FEFAC

17477	Philippine Coconut Authority PCA chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later this month to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community EC levy on vegetable oil imports I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is putting up this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countries like the Philippines Romero said in an interview He said he did not know how much support the levy had within the EC but he said he believed those originally opposed to the tax were under pressure to change their position Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany the Netherlands Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax But there was a danger some of them would be persuaded to change sides and if that happened opposition could crumble Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warning that copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained dangerous levels of aflatoxin a carcinogenic chemical He said the EC standard of 002 parts of aflatoxin per million parts of meal which EC countries had been asked to apply by October 1988 was too rigid He said Philippine copra cake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it is not properly dried or ground Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in London that the Philippines was doing its best to meet EC standards It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally but this was likely to take several years of research Copra meal exports were 817641 tonnes or 35 pct of total coconut exports in 1986 The meal was worth 735 mln dlrs Romero said he would also visit Oxford Universitys department of agricultural economics to discuss ways of avoiding the copra process altogether There are ways of producing coconut products outside of copra Romero said We can process fresh coconut without drying the meat in the sun Through the wet process we can process coconuts into other food or non-food products or we can go to the chemical root He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries to become more protectionist and he expected export prices of coconut products to drop In the long term we will be getting less and less for more and more production and Im not comfortable with that he said With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping up production of palm oil a coconut oil substitute palm oil output had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971 Romero said To add to that the US Soybean Association is spending billions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by saying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart he said Romero said he expected coconut product export prices to stay up for the rest of the year They would probably touch a high of 20 centspound from the current level of 1859 cents and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 1050 cents Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-year coconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall after two successive years of good harvests He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year to add to the production fall drought had affected output Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought the prices will start declining again The only sure way to keep prices stable is by processing adding more value he said Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by planting other cash crops between coconut trees he said A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on 10000 square metres of land Thats a lot of space Romero said He said the governments proposed land reform program would exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because they had less than the proposed seven-hectares of land If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels production and employment then it wont happen he said PCA figures show about one-third of the countrys population is dependent on the coconut industry Coconuts are planted on about 32 mln hectares or one-fourth of total agricultural land
18177	Nearby months in soybean and soymeal futures could post a short-term rally on tightening supply of livestock feed even if favorable growing conditions keep the new crop outlook bearish traders said A lot of soymeal dealers are just getting very worried about where processors will get their soybeans this Summer one Illinois soyproduct dealer said Processors are competing vigorously with river dealers for the few soybeans being offered by country elevators with a Decatur Illinois processor raising its spot soybean basis bid another two cents today to 10 over July futures Farmer marketings of old crop soybeans continue very light with flat prices apparently well below levels they are willing to sell dealers said Some terminal elevator operators are coming to the belief that even if futures rally back to last months highs country movement may remain light because farmers in many areas are sold out of old crop soybeans particularly in the eastern half of the Midwest Soybean processors will continue to take seasonal downtime for maintenance if soybeans remain difficult to buy reducing the weekly soybean crush rate still further and keeping the spot soymeal basis strong dealers said Futures traders said tight cash supplies should help July soybeans and soymeal gain on deferreds July soymeal has already moved to a premium over the August through October months and old crop Julynew crop November soybeans may also move to a July premium later this month they added
18482	Japanese compound feed output rose 23 pct to 2580 mln tonnes in 198687 ended March 31 from 2523 mln a year earlier the Agriculture Ministry said The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand for poultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beef cattle raising Ministry officials said Compound feed sales totalled 2601 mln tonnes in 198687 against 2540 mln a year ago while end-March stocks were 217554 tonnes against 224101 Corn use in feed output in 198687 rose to 1171 mln tonnes from 1102 mln a year earlier due to low import prices The officials said corn imports rose because the world surplus and the yens strength against the dollar reduced Chicago prices The corn compounding ratio rose to 452 pct in 198687 from 434 pct a year earlier Sorghum use rose marginally to 480 mln tonnes in 198687 from 479 mln but the compounding ratio fell to 185 pct from 189 pct because of greater corn use Higher import prices due to poor harvests last year in major producing nations such as Argentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum Soybean meal use fell to 258 mln tonnes from 263 mln and the compounding ratio declined to 100 pct from 103 pct The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted from increased use of cheaper rapeseed meal the officials said Rapeseed consumption in 198687 was 563889 tonnes against 528152 a year earlier The compounding ratio rose to 22 pct from 21 pct

14890	Australian markets are booming as foreign fund managers redirect capital away from the United States and other traditional markets analysts said High short-term interest rates a bullish stock market and an increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of fresh funds in the last two months largely from Japanese and US Investors analysts polled by Reuters said Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in and have settled on Australia Britain and Canada as they diversify from volatile US Dollar instruments they said A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in the past month record share prices and a 10-month high for the currency of 071 US Dlrs all illustrated the inflow Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital are not available but brokers said they received almost daily inquiries from Japan and the United States These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about and they dont know what to do with it Some of that is ending up here with the attraction of high interest rates and reasonable currency stability National Australia Bank Ltd economist Brian Hamley said There is a flight to quality Hamley said Australia may not be in the best economic position but there arent too many other countries where youd want to put your money The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against the volatility of the US Unit analysts said Were looking a more favoured market than perhaps the US Where some people would be concerned about the value of the US Dollar Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose said Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap and the currency looks stable But turning that capital into more permanent productive investment depends on government economic policy he said It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the direction in the economy Buttrose said adding that offshore investors would carefully watch the governments promised tough economic statement on May 14 While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding interest unobtainable elsewhere fund managers could just as easily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese who were badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar and hefty jumps in bond rates analysts said It will remain very edgy money If something was not to be delivered if the statement wasnt considered tough enough one might see a substantial outflow Buttrose said Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and stubborn current account deficit analysts said They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think they would like to leave the money here Buttrose said Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased interest in investment in Australia and the need to shield Japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency policy when he said authorities could not take their eyes off the yen because of the crucial role of Japanese investors Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked successfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar within the range of 100 to 103 yen Apart from its recovery against a weak US Dollar the Australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a trade-weighted basis in the last three weeks Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming Australian share market It has followed Wall Street and other markets but is also setting its own trend in response to the weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into equities particularly in the gold sector The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 17583 today nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986 while the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 30810 in the same period The property sector is also sought after with Japanese companies that have invested heavily in the United States in recent years turning their attention to undervalued real estate particularly in the tourism field Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydneys five-star Regent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs as indicative of the type of property being sought They think they find good value real estate here which with long term and fixed capital investment is the kind of investment Australia needs Buttrose added

14931	Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German economic growth In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs here Poehl said It would be an extremely risky policy to aim for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit He said the United States could face a vicious circle of depreciation inflation and more depreciation if it took that route Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet US Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy accelerating tax cuts cutting interest rates and tolerating above-target money supply growth He said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to the beginning of this year but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the West German parliament But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could accept on exports from a rising mark he said Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about one-third of its gross national product so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home A further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth he said Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade had given some extra leeway But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct not the reported negative inflation rates last year and West Germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments For the time being we will have to focus our policy more on the external side and we can live with a more expansionary money supply But we must be very careful he said He said he shared some of the US Concern about Japans trade surpluses which affected European countries as well as the United States Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries saying the importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level and that further changes would damage growth he said This was a remarkable change in attitude especially on the part of our American colleagues he said But he said there was still a danger that the correction of the dollars value could overshoot

15212	The relatively high level of real US interest rates suggests that there is scope for further declines in money market rates but the Federal Reserve is unlikely to promote such a drop as long as the dollar remains volatile said JP Morgan and Co Inc chairman Lewis Preston He said in response to a reporters question after the banks annual meeting that money market rates could decline further but I dont think the Fed is going to encourage that as long as the exchange markets are as volatile as they are On the other hand he said that barring a collapse of the dollar he did not see rates going much higher He said that Morgans recent rise in its prime lending rate was purely a reflection of an increase in a whole spectrum of rates Preston reiterated earlier company forecasts that the US economy should show roughly 25 to three pct real growth this year He also said that as a consequence of the dollars decline and oil price rises inflation would rise moderately to a 35 to four pct rate in 1987

15364	Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler called on central banks of major industrialised nations to cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies In a lecture at the University of Surrey pre-released here Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was protectionism and control on capital movements Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have them he said He added that West German growth forecasts would have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop to 180 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987 Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets had parted company with transactions in goods services and investments It was the scale of speculative transactions that determined market trends Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to grow To reverse such a rise in the money stock interest rates would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off In other words the monetary policy measures required are different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity Koehler said The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive US Current account deficit But attempts to keep the depreciation going by talking the dollar down posed problems The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep rise in the cost of US Imports and a sharp fall in the cost of European imports But the volume effect of falling imports to the US And rising imports to Europe would take time to make itself felt compared with the price effect Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going further than would be necessary to adjust the current account over the medium term Koehler said A reduction in the US Current account deficit would occur only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand In Japan and West Germany by contrast domestic demand should rise faster than GNP In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986 Koehler said If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be prevented the US Current account deficit could be offset by an inflow of foreign funds into the US But only if there was an appropriate interest rate differential would Europe and Japan look for financial investment in the US When selecting monetary policy instruments a central bank had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market and its substantial impact on exchange rates It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of price stability economic growth and full employment but also to tackle international problems like the exchange rate problem the debt problem and the current account problem A strategy had to be designed that helped the safeguarding of non-inflationary economic growth in an international monetary system largely free of disruptions Koehler said Given the system of floating exchange rates it was necessary for central banks to agree to intervene It sufficed to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over the next few years and intervention points should not be set because they were only testing points for the market he said In order to keep the international monetary system free of disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but also cooperate on interest rate policies Koehler said

16072	Todays turmoil in the US Financial markets with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollars wake is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology that is likely to spell more turbulence ahead economists said For two years the markets had hailed the dollars decline as the cure-all for the US Trade deficit Interest rates fell sharply and Wall Street became a one-way street up But that confidence is now cracking as the financial markets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volckers often-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse Volckers been saying for a long time that a dollar freefall would be extremely dangerous - now hes got it said David Jones economist at Aubrey G Lanston and Co Inc The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in 40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances short of further depreciation of the dollar Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid worries that the dollars slide will rekindle inflation scare away foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12 dlrs to a 1987 high of 4322070 dlrs an ounce while the spike in interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down by 33 points to 2339 Norman Robertson Mellon Bank chief economist called the markets instability frightening He believes economic fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that once you start the ball rolling its difficult to stop Theres a stark possibility that you could get a destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates and drives us into recession The markets are in a panic Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics in Washington has been warning for a long time that the controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 347 marks and 264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare Were still more or less on track for a hard landing But the agony may be fairly drawn out Marris told Reuters Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this year but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it would take very little to touch off what he calls the second phase of the hard landing whereby a loss of confidence in the dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession The stock markets reaction today and its sharp drop on March 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with historical experience which teaches that domestic markets are not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its decline Marris said He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollars latest weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling below 150 yen the floor that the market believes was set as part of the G-7 Paris agreement in February Robertson at Mellon by contrast said the loss of confidence was triggered last week when Washington announced plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic imports raising the specter of a debilitating trade war Many economists believe that long-run stability will not return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is addressed - excessive consumption in the US Reflected in the massive budget deficit But in the short term given the failure of the G-7 and of central bank intervention some feel that the Fed will have no choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a substantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding cut abroad at least by Japan said Lanstons Jones Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest rates even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for American farmers Latin American governments and others But Robert Giordano chief economist at Goldman Sachs and Co scoffed at the notion Its ridiculous to think the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak against just one currency This is yen strength not dollar weakness he said Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being made toward reducing the US Budget deficit Were going to have one of the biggest reductions in the budget deficit relative to GNP in history this year and nobody cares he said noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69 will have been greater He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year But for now market psychology has changed so abruptly that a further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out Put on your helmets Giordano said

16565	Major US banks may lift prime lending rates again within days due to recent increases in their borrowing costs and speculation the Federal Reserve is nudging up interest rates to help the dollar economists said In what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984 most banks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to 7-34 pct citing a reduced gap between the prime and their own cost of money That spread has narrowed again A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct is justified because the spread between banks cost of funds and the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a percentage point He said that spread had averaged around 14 percentage points since last October until it fell below one point and triggered the April prime rate rise at most banks We could easily have another prime rate increase as soon as this week said David Jones of Aubrey G Lanston and Co Weve got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the near future said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp Based on the spread between the prime rate and funding costs you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now said Harold Nathan economist at Wells Fargo Bank However he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan demand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintain recent upward pressure on money market interest rates Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures lift short-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar He said if there is widespread belief money market rates will stay high a prime rate rise could occur at any time Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a dollar drop could help rekindle US inflation As the dollar fell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday currency traders said the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar In addition to buying dollars outright another way to stabilize the US currency would be for the Fed to push US interest rates higher relative to overseas rates Based particularly on the Feds reserve management actions on Friday and today Nathan of Wells Fargo said it has become clear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure in the market It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interest rates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculation that the Fed is gently firming monetary policy That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in the market than most economists had expected On Friday the Fed added reserves indirectly and in small amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements with the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another high at 6-516 pct With funds trading even higher at 6-12 pct today the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 15 billion dlr round of customer repurchase agreements The Feds actions on Friday and today show that it is offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures said Jones of Lanston The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the need to defend the dollar Jones said He believes it is merely shading policy toward restraint now but to have a major impact on the dollar the Fed will have to tighten policy overtly at some point Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and within four to six weeks to raise its discount rate from 5-12 pct Jones said a US discount rate increase to six pct might well be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to further aid the dollar Given likely Fed policy firming he said both the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds about 830 pct now and the prime rate may be at 8-12 pct at end-June and nine pct by years end The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening policy to defend the dollar said Leslie of Discount Corp He said tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressures abate will show whether or not it is firming policy

17915	For currency dealers Karl Otto Poehl is the scourge of speculators for bankers he is the man who has played a key role in shaping the worlds financial destiny for the last seven years and for Germans he is the guardian of the mark President of the powerful and independent West German central bank the Bundesbank Poehl is likely to have his contract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the end of this year government officials say Index of economic spotlights see page ECRA But no official announcement has yet been made raising eyebrows in West Germanys business community The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in top ministerial posts under the Social Democrats now in opposition before he moved to the Bundesbank There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohl would try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his own Christian Democrats But officials noted that Poehl has worked closely and successfully with Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg since Kohls government took office in 1982 Poehl the most senior central banker apart from Paul Volcker of the United States enjoys a strong international reputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up Given these circumstances Kohl will probably overlook Poehls past as an adviser to former Social Democrat Chancellor Willy Brandt and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he was Finance Minister bankers said It was Schmidt who as Chancellor appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980 In recent months with the marks strong rise against the dollar Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of the Bundesbanks council a highly conservative institution which has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent inflation catching hold Older Germans can remember two bouts of galloping inflation this century But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986 and inflation negligible so far this year Poehl thinks it is safe to relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the dangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the dollarmark rate have reached a high priority also for the Bundesbank because a further massive revaluation of the mark would endanger the economy in West Germany he told business journalists in Frankfurt recently Ute Geipel head of research at Citibank AG says that Poehls reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy Poehls policy has always been a policy which does not focus so rigidly on domestic factors but also on the external economy she said An economist at a German bank who declined to be identified said If Poehl is confirmed in his post it will certainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so rigidly oriented towards money supply One of Poehls great struggles recently has been to persuade the United States to stop talking down the dollar For Poehl the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that the United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise currencies The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency dealers who said they would soon put it to the test But in fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact This is because the markets know - or perhaps because they dont know - what the central banks can do Poehl says of intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates round making a speculators position worthless Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist in the 1960s before starting his ministerial career A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over a glass of beer he is hardly a stereotype central banker He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and play golf Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute for correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount if you strike at the right moment he said Bundesbank dealers are very professional and skilled Theyve burnt the fingers of many people he said And unlike the speculators Poehl notes the Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit

17980	The Louvre agreement by the Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencies has worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at the economic summit in Venice on June 8-10 UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said Previewing the summit which he expected would not produce any major new economic initiatives Lawson told reporters work remained to be done on improving the conditions for lasting world economic growth530side measures to boost growth he said I think it is possible that there may be scope for a further reduction in interest rates in Germany he added but stressed that he had had no indication that such a move was likely He made no mention of Japanese interest rates Lawson said the US Should embark on a gradual reduction of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced satisfactory exchange rate stability in part thanks to heavy coordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks and he was content with sterlings exchange rate Pointing to the record 48 billion stg rise in UK May currency reserves announced today he said we have been playing a very full part ourselves  We have been intervening to a very much greater extent than we had done hitherto Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement may falter if member states did not implement the macro-economic commitments underlying the accord Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their commitments in Paris  In this respect He said the US Budget deficit was very important Noting the 6000 billion yen economic package announced by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawson said what is really needed in Japan is an increase in merchandise imports Supply side measures are critical There is a specific range of consumer and agricultural goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is wholly unjustified he said Lawson doubted that Tokyos partners would indulge in Japan bashing at the summit especially after the economic stimulation package and the announcement of Nakasones plans to increase Japanese development aid over the next three years Japans more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchange membership would also help deflect criticism he said He said he thought West Germany would instead come under pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to jack up faltering economic growth In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bring forward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts scheduled for 1990 He also called on Bonn to push ahead with the privatisation of German national industries On debt Lawson said he expected a three point British plan to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries to make progress in Venice The plan involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign debt in the Paris Club was first proposed at the IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington earlier this year Lawson said he would seek to consolidate political backing for the plan at the Venice summit and hoped the programme would be finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and Chase Manhattan to increase sharply their Third World debt provisions First it is a blow for realism Second because the market response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this sort of move than they felt before Citicorp he said UK Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions They have done it to some extent they need to do it more Lawson said adding it was up to the banks themselves to determine the appropriate size of provisions He also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be discussed at the summit There is a consensus which we have to push further

18086	The Bundesbank is unlikely to change credit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursday for its last session before the Venice summit banking economists and money market dealers said The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts and is unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates in the near future they said The council will meet in Saarbruecken and the meeting will be followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was usually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt and did not necessarily herald any policy moves Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger said today there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply growth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar was stable against the mark Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo where the Bundesbank has opened a representative office that the West German economy was now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted 12 to one pct in the first quarter Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in a 35070 pct range for most of this month after the Bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a minimum bid rate of 350 pct allocating funds at 355 pct They have set this signal and indicated they could maybe lower market rates even further but not with the discount or Lombard Winfried Hutmann chief economist of Schroeder Munchmeyer Hengst Investment GmbH said Werner Chrobok managing partner at Bethmann Bank said German rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and around historical lows for West Germany A further cut in rates would have little impact on the economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand with companies swimming in liquidity Chrobok said The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move on interest rates when this would be better held in reserve The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder he said A cut in the discount or Lombard rates to bring them in line with the new structure of money market rates since last month would have little practical significance dealers said The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a diplomatic gesture before next weeks Venice summit But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made it clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere eyewash Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government to cut taxes rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetary policy to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced tax cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget deficit it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further The Bonn government will be in a very weak position in Venice because they cant risk increasing the deficit further said Schroeder Muenchmeyer Hengsts Hutmann Bethmanns Chrobok said if anything is to happen before Venice it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy But I dont expect any convincing measures he said Money market dealers noted that call money continued to normalize today falling to 36070 pct from 37585 yesterday and as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up by month-end distortions Call money could come under upwards pressure later this month because of a major round of tax payments by banks on behalf of customers starting in the week beginning June 15 Two public holidays that week could also distort the market Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate funds tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 355 pct after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 350 pct and to fully replace the 55 billion marks in an outgoing pact But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank would allocate funds at 36 pct rather than 355 That would not represent a tightening of policy however Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates at the minimum accepted rate some banks may try to get a full allocation by bidding heavily at 36 pct dealers said On another issue Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely to lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency Unit ECU at one of its meetings soon Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement on this gesture to European unity as it is the capital of the Saarland bordering France and was twice under French occupation this century But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come this week as a number of technical and legal matters had still to be resolved for instance how German ECU accounts would be treated for minimum reserve purposes
18136	Fritz Leutwiler chairman of BBC AG Brown Boveri und Cie and a former Swiss National Bank president urged the National Bank to declare its intent of achieving a rising rate for the mark against the Swiss franc In a speech to shareholders Leutwiler said A gradually rising rate for the mark in relation to the franc would be desirable from the standpoint of industrial exports and with regard to sustaining Swiss industry Simply an appropriate declaration of intent by our bank of issue Swiss National Bank could have a positive effect he said Leutwiler who served 10 years as head of the Swiss central bank said such a step would not contradict the National Banks target of monetary stability Bringing the franc close to the mark would of course have to be done step by step under the watchful eye of monetary policy he told shareholders Realistically there is in fact no persuasive reason why the German currency is quoted almost 20 pct lower than the Swiss A National Bank spokesman said the relation of the mark and Swiss franc was an example of stable currency parities over a long period of time The spokesman said exchange rates were made by the market not the central bank and it would be impossible to influence individual parities separately Leutwiler said the Swiss National Bank could not support the value of the dollar even in conjunction with other central banks without putting monetary stability in jeopardy I would be the last to recommend that The key to a stronger dollar lies in the United States itself Leutwiler said
18142	Paul Volckers decision not to go for a third term as Federal Reserve Chairman and the nomination of Alan Greenspan to replace him have revived deep concerns about the US ability to prevent a further dollar decline and stem rising inflation financial market analysts said Although Greenspan is known as a committed anti-inflation fighter in the Volcker mould doubts are already surfacing in the US financial markets as to whether he has enough political clout and monetary experience to wage a tough campaign against inflation over the next year or two The critical issue is how Greenspan will deal with inflation said Stephen Axilrod Vice Chairman of Nikko Securities Co International Inc and former staff director for monetary and financial policy at the Fed A lot of questions have been raised by Volckers departure Until Greenspan answers them the markets will remain nervous added Stephen Slifer money market economist at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc This mornings announcement sent the dollar into a tailspin which was halted only by concerted central bank intervention in the open currency market
18185	Henry Kaufman managing director of Salomon Brothers Inc said the nomination of economist Alan Greenspan to replace Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker is bearish in the near term for the fixed income and currency markets The basic direction of interest rates is not changed The fundamental direction of interest rates continues to be upward interrupted by intermittent rallies Kaufman said in a statement He said the implication for equity markets in neutral to bullish Kaufman said Unlike Paul Volcker who entered the office of the Federal Reserve chairman with strong credibility both domestically and internationally Mr Greenspan will have to demonstrate both his competence and policy independence before he can gain full confidence of the financial markets Greenspan is most knowledgeable on the behavior of the US economy while his professional skills in the international area are much more limited Kaufman noted Consequently although he is well known abroad his views on issues such as the Less Developed Country Debt may initially carry less weight than have those of Mr Volcker

21561	An income tax surcharge and capital gains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of the NZ Dollar independent economist Len Bayliss said Bayliss a former economist with the Reserve Bank and the Bank of New Zealand said a major depreciation is needed to restore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by current government policies The taxes would help cut the budget deficit which in turn would lower the value of the NZ Dollar he said in a speech He added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 could be much higher than the governments 13 billion dlr forecast Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product a major tax increase was probably unavoidable Bayliss said He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct value-added goods and services tax introduced in October 1986 but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact Import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary impact of a currency depreciation The government had failed to bring inflation down despite lower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency he added New Zealands inflation rate was 169 pct in the year to end-September against 189 pct in the year to end June The major deficiency in the governments anti-inflation policies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and insufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit Bayliss said The government had also failed to reduce overseas debt and debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit The widespread belief that New Zealands problems are going to take much longer to solve than was originally thought is soundly based -- primarily because the governments macro-economic policies have been unsuccessful Bayliss said

15246	Robert Heller a member of the Federal Reserve Board said he expects more modest levels of growth in the money supply this year In my view this would not only be a logical but also a most desireable development he said in a speech prepared for delivery to an economic forum at Chapman College in Orange Calif A text was released in Washington He said the effect of lower inflation and financial deregulation on monetary aggregates was now largely finished Consequently monetary growth may return to more modest levels Heller said He noted growth in the money supply slowed after mid-January I would not be surprised at all if the monetary aggregates were to grow rather slowly during the balance of the year as well he added Heller said there was a danger of renewed price inflation The pricing behavior of American producers in response to price increases of their foreign competitors will be crucial for our economic future he said Widespread domestic price rises in response to rising import prices would generalize the inflationary forces emanating from the foreign trade sector and might not gain more market share for US producers A return to the stagflation of the late 1970s may well be the result of such a behavior pattern Heller warned He said we at the Federal Reserve will have to be disciplined in our conduct of monetary policy Heller said said the government should also exercise fiscal discipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint rather than new taxes The imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindle inflation and certainly would not make us more competitive in international markets Heller said He said the US economy should expand by nearly three pct during 1987 aided by higher exports to Europe and Canada A free trade agreement currently being negotiated with Canada would be exceedingly helpful in allowing American producers to compete more effectively in that country Heller said

16268	Four of West Germanys five leading economic research institutes warned that excessive monetary growth threatened a resurgence of inflation But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin echoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials said the expansion seen over the last 1-12 years did not necessarily threaten stability The five institutes issued a joint spring report in which three -- Kiel Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise in GNP in 1987 while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome in view of the slowdown in economic activity But experience has shown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a price rise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears may seem exaggerated they said But it has often turned out in the past that the price climate can quickly deteriorate forcing the central bank into a restrictive policy they said The economic costs of a preventive stability policy are less than fighting inflation once it has taken hold they said The four institutes disputed the view that monetary expansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domestic investors switch liquidity into longer term capital market investments following lower interest rates Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion of central bank money stock but do not automatically lead to a smaller expansion of money supply they said A return to growth and stability did not require spectacular central bank moves but could be done quietly with open market operations and repurchase pacts which would avoid an interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations The DIW institute said monetary policy should not be focused simply on growth of production potential Because of uncertainty about exchange rate developments and economic weakness other factors should be taken into account Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cuts and avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluation speculation Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threat in itself to price stability The 197981 inflation following strong 197778 money growth reflected other causes such as rising oil prices and the falling mark

17036	US banking data released today are too distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetary policy but they do support the markets assumption that the Federal Reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit economists said Its clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat Discount window borrowings net free reserves the Fed funds rate average and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent with a modest tightening said Dana Johnson of First Chicago Corp Johnson and several other economists now estimate that the Fed funds rate should trade between 6-14 and 6-38 pct Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were 935 mln dlrs a day producing a daily average for the two-week statement period of 689 mln dlrs the highest since the week of December 31 1986 and up from 393 mln dlrs previously Moreover banks were forced to borrow a huge 52 billion dlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total this year - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at the Fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in reserves than the Fed had anticipated However economists said it is almost certain that the Fed is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than witnessed this week They pointed to two factors that may have forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week First economists now expect M-1 money supply for the week ended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to pay annual income taxes As banks checking-account liabilities rise so do the reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 25 billion dlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday but economists said the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the projected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started to add reserves too late Second an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparently left Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with which to enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed economists said Thus although there were 103 billion dlrs of repos outstanding on Wednesday night the Fed may have wanted to add even more reserves but was prevented from doing so Its not at all inconceivable that the Fed didnt add as much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targetting discount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-38 pct After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has not tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging overnight injections of reserves until the last day of the statement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced that the Fed was tightening policy But after reviewing todays figures he said Its fair to say that the Fed may be moving toward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-14 and 6-38 pct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate unless the dollars fall gathers pace Johnson at First Chicago agreed citing political opposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a time when Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to reducing the US trade surplus with Japan

19028	New US Banking data suggest the Federal Reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady path and is not signalling any imminent change of course economists said But they also said that if money supply growth remains weak as this weeks unexpected eight billion dlr M-1 decline suggests it may this could influence the Fed to loosen its credit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetary policy A Reuter survey of 17 money market economists produced a forecast of a 600 mln dlr M-1 decline for the week ended June 8 with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to a decline of four billion Instead M-1 fell eight billion dlrs to 7457 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate Coming on the heels of a 43 billion decrease in M-1 for the week ended June 1 this means the nations money supply has fallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks economists said M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator of economic growth Sullivan said Fed officials might be concerned the latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growth in the broader monetary aggregates M-2 and M-3 which are seen as better gauges of economic growth Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May both measures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Feds 5-12 to 8-12 pct target ranges If money growth does not accelerate Fed officials concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging could turn toward easier monetary policy economists said Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current open market position No Sullivan said But does this mean the end of tightening for the time being Definitely yes Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings of 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement period were lower than they had expected Most believed the Fed had targetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs But they said that if it had not been for a large one-day net miss in the Feds reserve projections the higher borrowings target would probably have been reached A drop in May US Housing starts and continued weakness in auto sales show key sectors of the US Economy are lagging while a recent modest 03 pct gain in May producer prices has helped dispel inflation fears Slifer said If this continues we can entertain the notion of Fed easing at some point he said Other economists said the Fed would probably pay little attention to weak money supply growth It has been a number of years since M-1 has given good signs of whats going on in the economy one said I dont think M-1 shows that the economy is falling apart and the Fed should ease Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a prerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetary policy They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term rates for fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and higher inflation which would push up long-term yields and choke off econmomic growth But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late April The Fed has to determine if this represents a fundamental change for the dollar If it does then this gives them more room to ease he said

19471	Tenneco Inc said Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co its largest interstate natural gas pipeline will transport natural gas under the open access rules of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC In open access gas pipelines serve purely as a transport company moving gas from suppliers to customers Pipelines also transport its own gas to customers Earlier this week Transco Energy Co ltT rejected the FERC guidelines saying it would not offer open access until the regulatory body offers a solution to the exposure it faces for gas it has bought but could not sell The exposure faced by the industry stems from take or pay contracts under which pipelines bought gas on long-term contracts they could not sell The problem grew severe as customers won cheaper sources of gas because of open access Some industry analysts speculated earlier this week that Tenneco might follow Transcos lead and close its pipelines to open-access because of the take-or-pay issue But Tenneco today said open access is one of the steps FERC is taking to restructure the gas industry in the US FERC is moving the industry through this restructuring now even before all transitional problems are solved A spokesman said Tenneco faces 17 billion dlrs in exposure under the take-or-pay contracts but he had no specific figure for Tennessee Gas which runs 2000 miles of pipelines from Louisiana and Texas up to New England We remain convinced that the most critical transitional issue facing the industry--take-or-pay--must be resolved by FERC in the near future A failure to do so could have grave consequences for the industrys continued ability to provide its customers with reliable natural gas said Tennessee Gas Transmission Co president RC Thomas

18625	Analysts said they were surprised at the governments announcement of a forecast budget surplus for fiscal 1988 but said it was consistent with previous policy statements and positive for the economy Finance Minister Roger Douglas predicted a budget surplus for the year ending March 1988 of 379 mln New Zealand dlrs against a 195 billion deficit last year Analysts polled by Reuters said the forecast budget surplus was even more positive than the most bullish analysts forecasts and that this was good news for financial markets Market expectations among analysts questioned by Reuters before the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a 23 billion dlr deficit But none predicted a surplus The forecast initially looks positive for both the bond and the foreign exchange markets one analyst said Paradoxically the New Zealand dollar could rise in the medium term despite lower interest rates as overseas investors became more confident about investing in New Zealand he said However some foreign exchange dealers disagreed saying the local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and will move lower The local dollar dropped to 0594050 US Dlrs in after hours trading against 0597077 just before the budget release Analysts said the budget was also positive for the share market despite an increase in the contribution of company taxation to revenue figures One equities analyst predicted that the budget surplus announcement could push the share market up by 50 points tomorrow The Budget statement was broadly as expected with a continuation of existing policies and the absence of traditional pre-election incentives would be viewed positively by overseas investors another said But one merchant bank economist said that certain anti-tax avoidance measures could damage some sectors of the share market particularly multi-national companies The government is also lowering its borrowing requirements through bond tenders as a result of the surplus The requirement for the rest of the year is now down to 950 mln NZ Dlrs from a predicted 175 billion Predicted revenue in the Budget looked sustainable and there appeared to be no holding back on expenditure another economist said He added that the document seemed entirely credible Altogether it looks good for Labours election prospects he said An election is due before the end of September
21561	An income tax surcharge and capital gains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of the NZ Dollar independent economist Len Bayliss said Bayliss a former economist with the Reserve Bank and the Bank of New Zealand said a major depreciation is needed to restore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by current government policies The taxes would help cut the budget deficit which in turn would lower the value of the NZ Dollar he said in a speech He added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 could be much higher than the governments 13 billion dlr forecast Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product a major tax increase was probably unavoidable Bayliss said He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct value-added goods and services tax introduced in October 1986 but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact Import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary impact of a currency depreciation The government had failed to bring inflation down despite lower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency he added New Zealands inflation rate was 169 pct in the year to end-September against 189 pct in the year to end June The major deficiency in the governments anti-inflation policies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and insufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit Bayliss said The government had also failed to reduce overseas debt and debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit The widespread belief that New Zealands problems are going to take much longer to solve than was originally thought is soundly based -- primarily because the governments macro-economic policies have been unsuccessful Bayliss said

14858	Japans Agriculture Ministry angered by US Demands that Japan open its farm products market will tell US Officials at talks later this month that liberalisation would harm existing US Farm exports to Japan a senior ministry official said Imports from the US Would drop due to active sales drives by other suppliers the official who declined to be named said Japan is the largest customer for US Farm products and it is not reasonable for the US To demand Japan liberalise its farm import market he said Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the US Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open its wheat market where volume and origin are regulated to protect local farmers Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat exports as they are more competitive than the US He said End-users would also buy other origins grain traders said US Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who is due to visit Japan for talks between April 16-27 has said he will ask Japan to offer a share of its rice market to US Suppliers and remove quotas on US Beef and citrus imports Other countries are already cutting into the US Market share here Australia the largest beef supplier to Japan has been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year beef accord next March 31 Imports of US Corn have fallen due to increased sales from China and South America while Japanese soybean imports from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year although the US Will remain the largest supplier US Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its beef imports since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain imports mainly from the US Japanese officials said An indication of the US Position came last December when Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to US Agricultural exports with the beef market alone representing some one billion dlrs in new business The US Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import controls on 12 other farm products including fruit juices purees and pulp tomato juice ketchup and sauce peanuts prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans To help calm heated trade relations with the US Japans top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove residual import restrictions on agricultural products But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional reaction and the senior ministry official said the farm issue should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the industrial sector Japan is the largest buyer of US Farm products and these issues should not be discussed on the same table the official said
14892	Malaysia is unlikely to meet its targeted output of five mln tonnes of oil palm in calendar 1987 oil palm growers told Reuters Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 45 mln tonnes unchanged from 1986 because of drought low use of fertiliser and overstressed palms they said The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil World newsletter report that Malaysias oil palm output is likely to drop sharply this year Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne or about 115 ringgit less than soybean oil but Malaysia must sell more palm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage the industry a leading grower told Reuters The countrys palm oil stocks now total some 500000 tonnes against about 800000 last March the growers said The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this year due to pressure from South American and US Soybean output The current South American oilseed harvest mainly soybean is likely to be around 257 mln tonnes against the previous 217 mln tonne crop they said In addition new US Soybean plantings are also expected to enter the market around November when Malaysian palm oil output peaks They said new planting of palms is also likely to slow with some 50000 hectares expected to be planted with new trees against 100000 in 1986 although the effects of this reduction will not be felt for about another three years
15043	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 198687 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April trade sources said They said sunflower maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm dry weather which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas However as showers fell intermittently after last weekend producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province 83 mm in Cordoba 41 in Santa Fe 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones 95 in Corrientes eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops including soybean However as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 21 mln to 23 mln tonnes against 22 mln to 24 mln forecast last week and down 439 to 488 pct on the 198586 record of 41 mln Area sown to sunflowers was two to 22 mln hectares 299 to 363 pct below the record 314 mln hectares last season Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 95 mln to 98 mln tonnes against 96 mln to 99 mln estimated previously This is 222 to 234 pct below the 124 mln to 126 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 198586 crop and 219 to 258 pct down on the official figure of 128 mln tonnes Maize was sown on 358 mln to 378 mln hectares two to seven pct down on last seasons 385 mln Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba Santa Fe and Chaco Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April The total area sown was 123 mln to 130 mln hectares 103 to 152 pct down on the 145 mln sown last season The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 29 mln to 32 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 33 mln forecast last week and is 238 to 293 pct down on last seasons 41 mln to 42 mln tonne crop The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted remaining at a record 75 mln to 77 mln tonnes up 42 to 55 pct on the 72 mln to 73 mln estimated by private sources for 198586 and 56 to 85 pct higher than the official figure of 71 mln The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 37 mln to 38 mln hectares 108 to 138 pct up on the record 334 mln sown in 198586 The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available Preparation of the fields for the 198788 wheat crop which will be sown between May and August or September has so far not been as intense as in previous years
15106	Storage problems with Brazils record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito speaking from Brasilia told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this years estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting but that most of it would stem from storage problems Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes theoretically sufficient for the crop But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed The states of Sao Paulo Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nations capacity but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions where rising production has outpaced storage capacity Brito said the Centre-West whose crops include soya and maize had between 30 and 40 pct of the nations grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space In addition to the poor distribution of storage units there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain Brito said Finally there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries

15686	Based on field travel in the Brazilian state of Parana soybean yields should be about average or 20 to 22 tonnes per hectare the US Agriculture Departments officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report The report dated March 24 noted Parana accounts for about 20 to 24 pct of Brazils total soybean crop It said generally favorable weather from early December through February helped compensate for earlier dryness However hot dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days followed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the second week of march has raised concern about late planted soybeans which are still immature but the impact may be localized the report said The corn crop is expected to be a record and will create serious storage problems the report said Due to favorable support prices corn area increased by more than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans and yields are expected to be above average it said Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn crop crop has been harvested During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grain elevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn the report said New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Parana accounts for about 60 pct of total production Major reasons for the decline are expected reduced government support price and good summer crop harvests

17477	Philippine Coconut Authority PCA chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later this month to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community EC levy on vegetable oil imports I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is putting up this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countries like the Philippines Romero said in an interview He said he did not know how much support the levy had within the EC but he said he believed those originally opposed to the tax were under pressure to change their position Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany the Netherlands Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax But there was a danger some of them would be persuaded to change sides and if that happened opposition could crumble Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warning that copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained dangerous levels of aflatoxin a carcinogenic chemical He said the EC standard of 002 parts of aflatoxin per million parts of meal which EC countries had been asked to apply by October 1988 was too rigid He said Philippine copra cake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it is not properly dried or ground Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in London that the Philippines was doing its best to meet EC standards It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally but this was likely to take several years of research Copra meal exports were 817641 tonnes or 35 pct of total coconut exports in 1986 The meal was worth 735 mln dlrs Romero said he would also visit Oxford Universitys department of agricultural economics to discuss ways of avoiding the copra process altogether There are ways of producing coconut products outside of copra Romero said We can process fresh coconut without drying the meat in the sun Through the wet process we can process coconuts into other food or non-food products or we can go to the chemical root He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries to become more protectionist and he expected export prices of coconut products to drop In the long term we will be getting less and less for more and more production and Im not comfortable with that he said With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping up production of palm oil a coconut oil substitute palm oil output had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971 Romero said To add to that the US Soybean Association is spending billions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by saying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart he said Romero said he expected coconut product export prices to stay up for the rest of the year They would probably touch a high of 20 centspound from the current level of 1859 cents and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 1050 cents Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-year coconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall after two successive years of good harvests He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year to add to the production fall drought had affected output Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought the prices will start declining again The only sure way to keep prices stable is by processing adding more value he said Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by planting other cash crops between coconut trees he said A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on 10000 square metres of land Thats a lot of space Romero said He said the governments proposed land reform program would exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because they had less than the proposed seven-hectares of land If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels production and employment then it wont happen he said PCA figures show about one-third of the countrys population is dependent on the coconut industry Coconuts are planted on about 32 mln hectares or one-fourth of total agricultural land

15063	Cheap oil feedstocks the weakened US dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined US petrochemical industry to record profits this year with growth expected through at least 1990 major company executives predicted This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp ltGAF privately-held Cain Chemical Inc and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc ltASH the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period said Paul Oreffice chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co ltDOW adding Theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones Analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics are expected to buy quantities this year US petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year said John Dosher managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct he said Oreffice speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history In 1985 when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong US dollar Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it Oreffice said GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the US chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987 Last year the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs a 54 pct leap from 1985 The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning said Paces John Dosher Dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies That helped boost US chemical exports Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s Finally virtually all major US chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts GAF which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp ltUK recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp ltBOR a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals Another industry powerhouse WR Grace ltGRA has divested its retailing restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities such as ethylene in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers Companies like DuPont ltDD and Monsanto Co ltMTC spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated Dosher said But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market Some top chemical executives share the concern The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes GAFs Heyman cautioned The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised Specialty businesses do not stay special long Houston-based Cain Chemical created this month by the Sterling investment banking group believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend Chairman Gordon Cain who previously led a leveraged buyout of Duponts Conoco Incs chemical business has spent 11 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous high-margin business Cain said adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually Garo Armen an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum wood and steel products Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years provided the US economy continues its modest rate of growth

17966	The record 49 billion dlrs rise in UK Reserves in May to a total 347 billion has lifted hopes for a further cut in bank base lending rates after the June 11 general election market analysts said Sterling would have risen on the much better than expected number but for market nerves about the poll outcome they said But the weight of foreign currency and gold reserves now available to the authorities to support the pound should curb any market tendency to panic if UK Opinion polls show the ruling Conservative Partys lead slipping they added We have been intervening to a very much greater extent than we have done hitherto Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said at a news conference today commenting on the news of the record reserves rise He put the UK Intervention in the context of the Louvre accord between leading industrial nations to stabilise the dollar partly through direct intervention on foreign exchanges We have been playing a very full part ourselves he said But market analysts see the recent upward pressure on sterling and consequent need for official sales to damp down its rise more in the light of local factors Steven Bell chief economist at Morgan Grenfell Securities said that corporate money has been flowing back into Britain amid hopes of another Conservative government after fears last autumn of a Labour election victory sent it flooding out UK Portfolio investment is also returning while foreign buyers see UK Growth propects and high bond yields as attractive They will be strong buyers of UK Assets notably equities once the election is out of the way Bell said Analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lower interest rates as the government is expected to try to reverse the loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound Today however the pound hardly moved on the reserves news dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket of currencies from 731 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 GMT to 730 pct at 1100 GMT half an hour after the figures were released The market doesnt want to do anything because of the election commented an economist at a big US Investment bank Several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts of a rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs had overestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely to have been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on the forward market The market also seemed to have overestimated the amount of sterling the Bank of England bought at the end of May to smooth the pounds sudden downturn while some of the intervention reported in May probably occurred in April they said The key three months interbank money market rates eased about 18 point reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrend in UK Interest rates will be revived following the reserves news analysts said Government bond prices initially firmed but the market was muted as traders worried about the funding implications of another huge rise in reserves they added Morgan Grenfells Bell forecast a half point base rate cut from the current nine pct level soon after the election so long as poll projections of another Conservative victory prove accurate with another half point later Justin Silverton equity economist at Credit Suisse Buckmaster and Moore said a full point reduction might be possible Sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts in future rather than this active intervention he predicted Kevin Boakes of Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged cautioned against over-optimistic forecasts but agreed a half point cut looked likely A cut before the election has been virtually ruled out The Bank of England is both worried about the political problem of cutting rates during an election campaign  And has signalled some worry about broad money growth said Robin Marshall chief UK Economist at Chase Manhattan Securities He said the 10 billion dlrs increase in total reserves in the past seven months may foreshadow full UK Entry into the European Monetary System But Bell said the authorities would like to see another 10 or 15 billion dlrs in the reserves before joining if they did so But unlike many analysts he doubted the UK Will go in

21486	Saudi Arabia is likely to remain the key supplier of liquefied petroleum gas LPG to Japan for at least the next five years oil industry sources said Japan while diversifying its supply sources of propane and butane for stable supplies will continue to bank on Saudi Arabian LPG the sources said They said Saudis supply capabilities of LPG an associate of crude oil is guaranteed by its crude output capacity Saudi is a reliable supplier in that sense said one trader Japan imports about 50 pct of its LPG from Saudi Arabia No single nation could substitute for Saudi Arabia as an LPG supply source to Japan the sources said Saudi Arabia has committed itself to Japanese LPG buyers which has quelled fears that LPG supplies from the Mideast Gulf could easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilities in that area said another trader Saudi Arabia cut LPG shipments to Japan and elsewhere by 20 pct in September after a fire put a major gas plant at Al-Juaimah out of operation October shipments were back to contractual volumes as Saudi was able to boost exports from other ports Attacks on Gulf shipping by Iran and Iraq centered on crude rather than products carriers which has lulled fears of LPG supply disruptions traders said They said an Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz was unlikely because it would block Irans oil shipments Industry sources said Japans LPG imports will not greatly rise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at a moderate 21 pct a year from 1986 through 1991 Japanese term buyers of Saudi LPG are expected to lift slightly lower volumes from January 1987 when imports from Indonesia are slated to increase the sources said The customers are unlikely to slash Saudi term purchases in large scale when Japan increases annual imports of Indonesian LPG to 195 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319000 tonnes in the year ended March 1987 the sources said But when demand is sluggish in summer they will phase down term purchases of Saudi LPG and secure lower-priced cargoes on the spot market they said Japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of LPG a year of which 53 mln tonnes are supplied by Saudi Arabia 33 mln under term contracts and two mln through spot purchases Some 80 pct of Japans LPG imports are from the Middle East Saudi Arabias state owned oil company Petromin has made some concessions on term prices to Japanese customers in the recent round of contract renewal talks and it is likely the Japanese will accept the offer the sources said The Japanese term customers however have so far been unsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula to replace the existing unilateral monthly price notice Japanese buyers pay Saudi Arabia a price notified by Petromin each month Most recently the FOB price was set at 87 pct of the 1752 dlrs per barrel government selling price GSP of Arabian Light Buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftings should the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of Arabian Lights GSP Petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the 95 pct for contracts with Japanese customers from next January the trade sources said Petromin also suggested that a sellers option of supplying up to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject to seller-buyer agreement Under the present contract Petromin can automatically cut supplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume If you want to import LPG from Saudi Arabia on a profitable basis you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct said an official at a major importer Freight costs are higher for cargoes coming from the Gulf than Southeast Asia due to a longer haul and war risk insurance payments Japanese customers will visit Saudi Arabia this month to finalise their separate contract talks now focusing on contractual period and volume which could be very similar to current levels the sources said When we talk business we would seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability of high dependence on a single supplier said one

18482	Japanese compound feed output rose 23 pct to 2580 mln tonnes in 198687 ended March 31 from 2523 mln a year earlier the Agriculture Ministry said The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand for poultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beef cattle raising Ministry officials said Compound feed sales totalled 2601 mln tonnes in 198687 against 2540 mln a year ago while end-March stocks were 217554 tonnes against 224101 Corn use in feed output in 198687 rose to 1171 mln tonnes from 1102 mln a year earlier due to low import prices The officials said corn imports rose because the world surplus and the yens strength against the dollar reduced Chicago prices The corn compounding ratio rose to 452 pct in 198687 from 434 pct a year earlier Sorghum use rose marginally to 480 mln tonnes in 198687 from 479 mln but the compounding ratio fell to 185 pct from 189 pct because of greater corn use Higher import prices due to poor harvests last year in major producing nations such as Argentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum Soybean meal use fell to 258 mln tonnes from 263 mln and the compounding ratio declined to 100 pct from 103 pct The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted from increased use of cheaper rapeseed meal the officials said Rapeseed consumption in 198687 was 563889 tonnes against 528152 a year earlier The compounding ratio rose to 22 pct from 21 pct

18177	Nearby months in soybean and soymeal futures could post a short-term rally on tightening supply of livestock feed even if favorable growing conditions keep the new crop outlook bearish traders said A lot of soymeal dealers are just getting very worried about where processors will get their soybeans this Summer one Illinois soyproduct dealer said Processors are competing vigorously with river dealers for the few soybeans being offered by country elevators with a Decatur Illinois processor raising its spot soybean basis bid another two cents today to 10 over July futures Farmer marketings of old crop soybeans continue very light with flat prices apparently well below levels they are willing to sell dealers said Some terminal elevator operators are coming to the belief that even if futures rally back to last months highs country movement may remain light because farmers in many areas are sold out of old crop soybeans particularly in the eastern half of the Midwest Soybean processors will continue to take seasonal downtime for maintenance if soybeans remain difficult to buy reducing the weekly soybean crush rate still further and keeping the spot soymeal basis strong dealers said Futures traders said tight cash supplies should help July soybeans and soymeal gain on deferreds July soymeal has already moved to a premium over the August through October months and old crop Julynew crop November soybeans may also move to a July premium later this month they added

14892	Malaysia is unlikely to meet its targeted output of five mln tonnes of oil palm in calendar 1987 oil palm growers told Reuters Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 45 mln tonnes unchanged from 1986 because of drought low use of fertiliser and overstressed palms they said The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil World newsletter report that Malaysias oil palm output is likely to drop sharply this year Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne or about 115 ringgit less than soybean oil but Malaysia must sell more palm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage the industry a leading grower told Reuters The countrys palm oil stocks now total some 500000 tonnes against about 800000 last March the growers said The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this year due to pressure from South American and US Soybean output The current South American oilseed harvest mainly soybean is likely to be around 257 mln tonnes against the previous 217 mln tonne crop they said In addition new US Soybean plantings are also expected to enter the market around November when Malaysian palm oil output peaks They said new planting of palms is also likely to slow with some 50000 hectares expected to be planted with new trees against 100000 in 1986 although the effects of this reduction will not be felt for about another three years

18781	The rate of increase in world palm oil use is likely to slow next season despite an expected 800000 tonne production rise to 813 mln tonnes Siegfried Mielke editor of the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said He told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days that in the next OctSept 198788 season palm oil use will rise to 825 mln tonnes from 771 mln below the five-year average increase of 550000 tonnes Opening stocks at the start of next October are expected to be about 14 mln tonnes 300000 tonnes below year-earlier levels bringing total supplies to 95 mln tonnes he said The anticipated total supplies will be about 500000 tonnes above this seasons available amount Mielke said The increase in mature palm tree areas in Malaysia will slow down from this year on but that will be offset by area expansion in Indonesia he said He estimated the combined rise in Malaysian and Indonesian mature area at 87 pct next year after 95 pct this year and at 67 pct in 1989 and 50 pct in 1990 Malaysia also is shifting plantings to Sabah and Sarawak where the rate of expansion is higher than in the Peninsula but where yields are lower he said The stocksusage ratio of seven major oils is also expected to decline Mielke said The oils are soybean cottonseed sunflowerseed coconut rapeseed palmkernel and palm At the start of October 1986 stocks of these oils were unusually high and represented 68 weeks of the current seasons prospective demand compared with six weeks a year ago and with 54 weeks in 1984 he said Mielke expects the ratio to fall to 59 weeks by the start of next October and to the unusually low level of 54 weeks by the end of next season The stocksusage ratio for palm oil was 114 weeks last October and is likely to be 87 weeks next October and 77 at the end of next season Mielke said World oilseed stocks also are expected to fall in the course of the next season with the biggest reduction seen in soybean stocks which Mielke expects to decline by 50 mln tonnes or by one fifth Almost all of the decline is expected to occur in the US for which he estimated ending stocks next season at 107 mln tonnes or 393 mln bushels against anticipated ending stocks of 15 mln tonnes or 551 mln bushels at the end of this season
14858	Japans Agriculture Ministry angered by US Demands that Japan open its farm products market will tell US Officials at talks later this month that liberalisation would harm existing US Farm exports to Japan a senior ministry official said Imports from the US Would drop due to active sales drives by other suppliers the official who declined to be named said Japan is the largest customer for US Farm products and it is not reasonable for the US To demand Japan liberalise its farm import market he said Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the US Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open its wheat market where volume and origin are regulated to protect local farmers Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat exports as they are more competitive than the US He said End-users would also buy other origins grain traders said US Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who is due to visit Japan for talks between April 16-27 has said he will ask Japan to offer a share of its rice market to US Suppliers and remove quotas on US Beef and citrus imports Other countries are already cutting into the US Market share here Australia the largest beef supplier to Japan has been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year beef accord next March 31 Imports of US Corn have fallen due to increased sales from China and South America while Japanese soybean imports from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year although the US Will remain the largest supplier US Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its beef imports since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain imports mainly from the US Japanese officials said An indication of the US Position came last December when Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to US Agricultural exports with the beef market alone representing some one billion dlrs in new business The US Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import controls on 12 other farm products including fruit juices purees and pulp tomato juice ketchup and sauce peanuts prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans To help calm heated trade relations with the US Japans top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove residual import restrictions on agricultural products But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional reaction and the senior ministry official said the farm issue should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the industrial sector Japan is the largest buyer of US Farm products and these issues should not be discussed on the same table the official said
14892	Malaysia is unlikely to meet its targeted output of five mln tonnes of oil palm in calendar 1987 oil palm growers told Reuters Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 45 mln tonnes unchanged from 1986 because of drought low use of fertiliser and overstressed palms they said The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil World newsletter report that Malaysias oil palm output is likely to drop sharply this year Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne or about 115 ringgit less than soybean oil but Malaysia must sell more palm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage the industry a leading grower told Reuters The countrys palm oil stocks now total some 500000 tonnes against about 800000 last March the growers said The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this year due to pressure from South American and US Soybean output The current South American oilseed harvest mainly soybean is likely to be around 257 mln tonnes against the previous 217 mln tonne crop they said In addition new US Soybean plantings are also expected to enter the market around November when Malaysian palm oil output peaks They said new planting of palms is also likely to slow with some 50000 hectares expected to be planted with new trees against 100000 in 1986 although the effects of this reduction will not be felt for about another three years
15043	Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 198687 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April trade sources said They said sunflower maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm dry weather which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas However as showers fell intermittently after last weekend producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province 83 mm in Cordoba 41 in Santa Fe 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones 95 in Corrientes eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops including soybean However as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again The seasons sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 21 mln to 23 mln tonnes against 22 mln to 24 mln forecast last week and down 439 to 488 pct on the 198586 record of 41 mln Area sown to sunflowers was two to 22 mln hectares 299 to 363 pct below the record 314 mln hectares last season Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 95 mln to 98 mln tonnes against 96 mln to 99 mln estimated previously This is 222 to 234 pct below the 124 mln to 126 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 198586 crop and 219 to 258 pct down on the official figure of 128 mln tonnes Maize was sown on 358 mln to 378 mln hectares two to seven pct down on last seasons 385 mln Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba Santa Fe and Chaco Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April The total area sown was 123 mln to 130 mln hectares 103 to 152 pct down on the 145 mln sown last season The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 29 mln to 32 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 33 mln forecast last week and is 238 to 293 pct down on last seasons 41 mln to 42 mln tonne crop The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted remaining at a record 75 mln to 77 mln tonnes up 42 to 55 pct on the 72 mln to 73 mln estimated by private sources for 198586 and 56 to 85 pct higher than the official figure of 71 mln The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 37 mln to 38 mln hectares 108 to 138 pct up on the record 334 mln sown in 198586 The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available Preparation of the fields for the 198788 wheat crop which will be sown between May and August or September has so far not been as intense as in previous years
15106	Storage problems with Brazils record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito speaking from Brasilia told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this years estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting but that most of it would stem from storage problems Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes theoretically sufficient for the crop But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed The states of Sao Paulo Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nations capacity but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions where rising production has outpaced storage capacity Brito said the Centre-West whose crops include soya and maize had between 30 and 40 pct of the nations grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space In addition to the poor distribution of storage units there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain Brito said Finally there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries

15686	Based on field travel in the Brazilian state of Parana soybean yields should be about average or 20 to 22 tonnes per hectare the US Agriculture Departments officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report The report dated March 24 noted Parana accounts for about 20 to 24 pct of Brazils total soybean crop It said generally favorable weather from early December through February helped compensate for earlier dryness However hot dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days followed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the second week of march has raised concern about late planted soybeans which are still immature but the impact may be localized the report said The corn crop is expected to be a record and will create serious storage problems the report said Due to favorable support prices corn area increased by more than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans and yields are expected to be above average it said Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn crop crop has been harvested During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grain elevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn the report said New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Parana accounts for about 60 pct of total production Major reasons for the decline are expected reduced government support price and good summer crop harvests

17731	European free market tin traders made a somewhat muted response to plans for a Kuala Lumpur dollar-based tin futures market due to be launched in October Traders said the new market would probably be a useful trading medium for Japan and other South East Asian tin interests although European traders generally appear to be reasonably satisfied with the current free market system which has been operating since London Metal Exchange LME tin trading ceased in October 1985 Dealers here will also want to see how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market and what sort of demand develops for forward deliveries There is also a view among European traders that while the proposed Kuala Lumpur tin futures market would provide another useful reference point a market inaugurated by the Malaysian government -- in the past viewed as a major player at times by the trade -- would make participants uncomfortable Some traders expressed a preference for a resumption of trading on the London Metal Exchange but they added that while there has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subject a definite move is unlikely until outstanding High Court litigation actions have been resolved Spot tin prices on the European free market are currently around 4200 stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouse Rotterdam Over the past 18 months the price moved to a ten year low of 3400 stg in March 1986 and rebounded to as high as 4680 stg in December 1986 This compares with 8140 stg last paid when LME trading ceased in October 1985 and a record high tin price of 10350 stg traded for Cash Standard Grade metal in June of that year LME warehouse stocks are now near a two-year low at 28065 tonnes having fallen steadily from a record high of 72485 tonnes reached in February 1986 Traders said the free market turned bullish during late last year based on producer forecasts of a supplydemand deficit of some 2800029000 tonnes Analysts were predicting prices of up to 5000 stg per tonne during 1987 However the trend was reversed following a strong upswing in sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to 4100 stg last month after approaching 4700 stg in December The decline accelerated as producers who had sold very little metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers There was also a lack of significant demand from major steel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year Traders say the 15 ITC creditor banks original tin holdings of nearly 45000 tonnes have now been almost halved and the bulk of material still available is being held by Malaysian and Japanese firms which are reluctant to depress the market with unwanted metal Some 80000 tonnes were held by banks and brokers after the International Tin Councils ITC buffer stock manager halted support operations on the LME on behalf of the 22 members nations of the International Tin Agreement The overhang of metal was reduced further by broker Shearson Lehman Brothers which earlier this year reported having sold its ITC-related holdings and halved its overall tin position Analysts see no immediate sign of a rally in European tin prices and movements are still expected to be largely related to currency fluctuations unless significant consumer demand emerges for the third quarter The Association of Tin Producing Countries ATPC has made efforts since the collapse of the ITA to achieve higher world prices by attempting to bring all major producers under an export control umbrella but to date Brazil and China two major producers remain unaffected by the ATPC argument and apparently are continuing to offer material at discounts to consumers in main European trading centres dealers said
18924	The International Tin Council ITC intervened in a High Court hearing in an attempt to prevent the presentation of internal Council documents as evidence The intervention in Shearson Lehmans action against the London Metal Exchange over its ring out of tin contracts in 1986 is likely to have implications for other cases in which the Council is involved following the collapse of its buffer stock operations in October 1985 ITC delegates said The ITCs case is being presented by Professor Rosalyn Higgins and is expected to take a further one or two days next week Court does not sit tomorrow In essence the Council is claiming that its status is similar to that of a foreign embassy and that its archives can therefore not be used in an English court of law The Council ended its quarterly session today ahead of schedule The meeting had been expected to go on until tomorrow when the European Communitys legal advisers were due to attend but delegates reviewed the progress of the various legal actions today Otherwise the meeting was occupied with internal administrative matters delegates said The ITC will continue to operate with a reduced staff after June 30 following the two year extension of the sixth International Tin Agreement As well as dealing with the ongoing litigation the Council will continue with its statistical work and carry out some research studies although staffing in the research department is being cut to one from two previously At this weeks session the Council elected Philip Sparkes of Australia as first vice-chairman for the producing members and Heinz Hofer of Switzerland as second vice-chairman for the consumers for the year from July 1 Future quarterly sessions are scheduled for October 57 and December 1416
19065	Thailands major tin exporter and producer ltThailand Smelting and Refining Co Thaisarco said it may be unable to meet all its overseas orders because of insufficient supplies of tin concentrates from Thai mines Local mines cut combined daily tin concentrate sales to Thaisarco a Royal DutchShell Group ltRDAS unit to less than 20 tonnes earlier this month from a previous 40 to 45 tonne average commercial manager Yoot Eamsa-ard told Reuters He said the cuts resulted from a government decision to let the temporary business and municipal tax reductions on exported tin lapse on June 3 The taxes levied on the tin mines rose to 44 pct this month from 11 pct ad valorem over the past year The lower levels had been introduced last year as a temporary move to aid the tin industry after prices collapsed in late 1985 Yoot said Thaisarco had to dig into its stocks to meet a large portion of new overseas orders which were averaging 100 tonnes per day As a result he said Thailand could fail to fill some 3000 tonnes of its 19000 tonne tin export quota allocated by the Association of Tin Producing Countries ATPC for the year ending February 1988 Reduced tin exports this year could cause the ATPC to allocate a lower quota next year Yoot said The supplies shortage should prove temporary however because the Thai cabinet is expected to review a Mineral Resources Department proposal to reinstate the low taxes late this month Yoot said The department said Thailand exported 7715 tonnes of tin during JanuaryMay compared with 8462 tonnes a year ago

15352	Financial analysts say they are pleased with congressional moves to trim next years federal budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help improve the US trade deficit or buoy the economy The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrow to approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the coming fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs Similarly the Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next year In terms of the economy 37-38 billion dlrs is infinitesimal so cuts of this magnitude will have little impact on the economy and the trade deficit said Stanley Collander a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst At best it will have a small positive effect Collander said in an interview Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedly told Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar The US government has attempted to remedy the trade imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar But Volcker has warned that a further fall in the dollars value is fraught with danger Such a decline he has said could refuel inflation as imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit In addition in February US officials meeting with other major industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates should be stabilized at around current levels As part of that agreement Japan and West Germany agreed to take steps to stimulate their economies and the United States agreed to cut its budget deficit The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a way to deal with the trade deficit Volcker said recently is to reduce US consumption particularly federal spending If you dont deal with the budget deficit everything else you do is going to be counterproductive Volcker said in recent testimony before the Senate Banking Committee Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the governments purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United States Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed that any deficit reduction was better than none But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar from plunging further in world exchange markets Theres no doubt that some deficit reduction helps but if your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the Feds flexibility to conduct monetary policy then the answer is its not enough Silvia told Reuters The US trade deficit has become one of the governments most vexing and persistent problems The 1986 deficit was 1698 billion dlrs and there is as yet little indication that this years figure will be any lower though administration officials have predicted it will drop by about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by years end In the past Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep worrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the federal budget On the other hand he also has made it clear he is not attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for the 1986-1991 period by last years Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for next years federal deficit both the House and Senate Budget Committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs For political reasons 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the most youre going to get out of Congress at the present time said Touche Rosss Collander To do something more than that would be extraordinary remarkable and very very difficult Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up short of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels To an extent this has become the minimum acceptable reduction level he explained Anything less than that will now look like a failure to Wall Street The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year beginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their anticipated spending levels for next year The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 185 billion dlrs in new taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts
15372	Japans little-known Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications MPT has emerged as an international force to be reckoned with political analysts said MPT thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the US And Britain is in a position of strength due to its control of a lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians they said The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of a key industrial sector telecommunications and information said one diplomatic source They are a potent political force the diplomatic source said But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy analysts said The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not so internationalized said Waseda University professor Mitsuru Uchida Suddenly theyre standing at the centre of the world community and in that sense theyre at a loss as to how to face the situation Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with London over efforts by Britains Cable and Wireless Plc to keep a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in Japans lucrative overseas telephone business The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival groups arguing the market cannot support more than one competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd which now monopolizes the business It has also opposed a major management role in the planned merger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on the grounds that no such international precedent exists The ministrys stance has outraged both London which has threatened to retaliate and Washington which says the merger plan is evidence of Japans failure to honour pledges to open its telecommunications market Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it says have limited access for US Firms to Japans car telephone and satellite communications market Much of MPTs new prominence stems from the growth of the sector it regulates What has been happening is an important shift in the economy which makes the ministry a very important place said James Abegglen head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory Service Inc A decision to open the telecommunications industry to competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted rather than lessened MPTs authority analysts said With the legal framework eased they became the de facto legal framework said Bache Securities Japan analyst Darrell Whitten Close links with the powerful political faction of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party LDP nurtured by former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPTs influence the analysts said Other factions ignored MPT in the 1970s but the Tanaka faction was forward looking and  Recognized the importance of MPT Uchida said Many former bureaucrats became members of the influential political group he added The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to the more than 100000 billion yen worth of deposits in the Postal Savings System analysts said MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate interest rates on small deposits a key element in financial liberalisation since the change would remove the Postal Savings Systems ability to offer slightly higher rates than banks they said Diplomatic sources frustrated with what they see as MPTs obstructionist and protectionist posture have characterized the ministry as feudal Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf limiting competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its wing Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest price takes a back seat to such considerations they said But many of the ministrys actions are not unlike those of its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world including Britain several analysts said The United States is really the odd man out Abegglen said For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order in utilities markets is not an unusual andor unreasonable view he said

16139	Member states of the European Community are starting to run out of patience with Japan which they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open its market to imports but as often made only minor moves Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the willingness or at least the ability of the Japanese government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC However they said an all-out trade war may be far off as EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the US Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17 The EC tariffs which would involve renouncing obligations entered into with the world trade body GATT would be designed to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of the US The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the ECs trade deficit with Japan reached a record 213 billion dlrs in March up from 194 billion in February In 1986 Japanese exports to the EC totalled 3067 billion dlrs up 45 pct from 1985 while EC exports to Japan fell one pct to 1243 billion dlrs In Paris trade minister Michel Noir said France has decided to give Japan a taste of its own medicine Burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozen Coquilles St Jacques will be restricted by a strict application of French quality standards -- something EC states say often happens to their own exports entering Japan Britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of Japanese banks and insurance companies to operate in the City of London because the British Cable and Wireless company lost out in competition for a Japanese telecommucations contract However British officials in London have said that the government may have gone too far in implying that it would take immediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened By contrast West Germany with the ECs most successful economy has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions preferring to rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its own industries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recent years substituting general calls for action by Japan to open its market with specific demands for moves in key areas At present it is for instance pressuring Japan to end allegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines and spirits to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contracts for the building of a new international airport and to simplify certification and safety checks on imported cars EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits but often the Japanese announce modifications of their non-tariff barriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount They stress however that any action must be taken by the EC as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action One of the problems Britain could face if it were to withdraw licences for Japanese banks would be that the bankers would be welcomed with open arms in Frankfurt or Amsterdam they point out

16777	Basic reform of Japans protected farm sector is a key to shifting its economy away from export to domestic-led growth a vital step if it is to trim its trade surplus securities analysts said The farm sector which is protected by import tariffs and quotas propped up by subsidies and price supports and sheltered by the tax system has ample room for change they said In economic terms reform would be a plus said Christopher Chew of brokerage firm James Capel and Co The ultimate cost of the existing system is food prices twice those in Europe and two to three times those in the US The analysts said Spending on food accounts for about one quarter of the average households budget and roughly 10 pct of the gross national product GNP according to a study by Chew Reducing these prices could increase household spending power by five pct his study said The money could be spent on products which would have a more direct impact in boosting domestic growth it added Theres a lot of slack a US Government official in Tokyo said All that money could be spent on something else Direct central government subsidies to the farm sector amount to some five billion dlrs per year Independent estimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37 billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farm on weekends to put their land up for sale for residential development would also give a boost to domestic spending economists said Housing construction is the key strategic variable in the expansion of domestic demand wrote Chihiro Nakajima professor at Kyoto Gakuen University Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reform to shift some of the burden of trade friction and economic restructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto the farm sector Employers groups also want change If you really want to expand domestic demand the way to do it is not to raise wages recklessly but to reduce commodity prices Bumpei Otsuki President of the Japan Federation of Employers Associations told a recent press conference External pressures are rising as the US And Europe seek removal of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their trade deficits with Japan But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain well entrenched dimming prospects for quick reform analysts said Although the full-time farm population is falling and there are signs the LDP is paying more attention to urban constituencies the ruling party remains heavily dependent on farm votes in the rural areas One rural vote is worth several city votes due to the pattern of constituency borders The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reform plan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon the analysts said Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept the traditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay for national food security they said Powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed to import liberalisation but are more flexible about reforms aimed at stepping up productivity they said Reform when it comes will be in response to specific pressure rather than an all-embracing program said Chew

16794	President Reagan today is to announce a decision on tough new tariffs on Japanese exports to retaliate for what he calls Japans failure to end its unfair practices in semiconductor trade The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs of Japanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel of experts headed by the US Trade Representatives Office Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffs on certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computors and television sets to power tools and photographic film The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some 20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to Santa Barbara where Reagan is vacationing In his March annoucement Reagan said I am committed to full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade opportunities He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored the pact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in world markets and opened its home market to US products US officials said Japan had done nothing since the March announcement to alter Reagans plan to invoke the sanctions White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday  we do not want a trade war but we feel that this is the kind of action that requires meaningful action Reagans move follows steadily rising US trade deicits with last years hitting a record 1698 billion About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president to retaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices He has opposed the legislation saying it would prevent negotiated solutions to trade disputes and in any case that existing law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese was as much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did not need any new trade legislation The Japanese have complained that they have been honoring the semiconductor pact but that it would take time before the results showed up US officials however have said their monitoring of Japanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries and Western Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that the Japanese home markets remained shut to American exports Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs it would file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade GATT It said hoped GATT would find the US retaliation had violated the regulations of the global trading group and would approve compensation or Japanese retaliation US officials have said they did not think Japan would retaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war with the United States

16871	The Commerce Department said on that insurance and freight costs for imported goods of 145 billion dlrs were included in the February trade deficit of 151 billion dlrs reported on Tuesday The department is required by law to wait 48 hours after the initial trade report to issue a second report on a customs value basis which eliminates the freight and insurance charges from the cost of imports Private-sector economists emphasized that the Commerce Department was not revising down the deficit by 145 billion dlrs but simply presenting the figures on a different basis A report in the Washington Post caused a stir in the foreign exchanges today because it gave the impression dealers said that the underlying trade deficit for February had been revised downward The Commerce department would like to have the law changed to permit it to report both sets of figures simultaneously My feeling is the second one is a better report but theres legislation that requires us to delay it two days said Robert Ortner Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs But this has been going on for a long time and no one pays any attention to the second figure The 151 billion dlr February trade deficit compared with a revised January deficit of 123 billion dlrs The law requiring a 48-hour delay in publishing the monthly trade figure excluding freight and insurance was passed in 1979 Reportedly the feeling was the first figure which includes customs freight and insurance allowed a better comparison with other countries that reported their trade balances on the same basis The second figure which would always be lower by deducting freight and insurance presents the deficit in a more favorable light for the Reagan administration Ortner said he would like to see the law changed to eliminate the 48-hour delay in reporting the two figures Were considering it he said Its one of those dinosaur laws and I think its time has come The second figure which would always be lower by deducting freight and insurance presents the deficit in a more favorable light for the Reagan administration Ortner said he would like to see the law changed to eliminate the 48-hour delay in reporting the two figures Were considering it he said Its one of those dinosaur laws and I think its time has come
16926	The tough trade sanctions President Reagan imposed on Japanese exports are not only a shot across Japans bow but also a sign Reagan will attack unfair trade practices worldwide US officials said But Robert Crandall a trade specialist at Brookings Institution a think tank said a shot across their bow can often result in a shot in our stern He said it left the United States open to retaliation The US officials said the 100 pct tariffs Reagan ordered on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods will also show Congress that a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws and no new protectionist legislation is needed In the past year tough trade action had been taken against the European Community over corn and sorghum Taiwan over beer and wine South Korea over counterfeiting of copyrights patents and trademarkets and Japan on tobacco White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the tariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a serious signal to other nations on the need for fair trade practices Reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers television sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honor an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its markets to US products The tariffs were placed on items which were available from other sources so there would be little effect on the American consumer Fitzwater said Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action - especially against Japan - to end global unfair trade practices and reverse the growing US trade deficit The alternative was that if he did not Congress would The US trade gap last year was a record 1698 billion dlrs and continues to rise with Japan accounting for about one-third of Americas overall deficit But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada West Germany Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said the president is ready to fight them all Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that I regret that these actions are necessary but that the health and vitality of the US semiconductor industry was essential to American competitiveness in world markets We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading practices Reagan added in the statement from his California vacation home at Santa Barbara He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japan abided by the agreement US officials say the action today will show Congress -which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that he already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade The White House aide said of the tariff action it wasnt done to appease Congress but because there was an unfair trade practice The aide added however on another plane it was an example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight unfair practices an that it is not necessary to make a major overall of our trade laws But the analyst Crandall said the tariff action was not in the best interests of the United States and that negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue Its very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route he said because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in trade Crandall said the administration is doing this for its political impact across the country and therefore its impact on Congress He said I dont think it makes a lot of sense But other analysts said it made little difference whether the tariffs were aimed at US trading partners or Congress and that the main point was that the trading partners were on notice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use Spokesman Fitzwater said we dont want a trade war but the imposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated Crandall said the administration is doing this for its political impact across the country and therefore its impact on Congress He said I dont think it makes a lot of sense But other analysts said it made little difference whether the tariffs were aimed at US trading partners or Congress and that the main point was that the trading partners were on notice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use Spokesman Fitzwater said we dont want a trade war but the imposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated
16929	US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he was almost sure Japan would not retaliate against tariffs President Reagan slapped on 300 mln dlrs of Japanese electronic goods today Id say its 99 plus pct sure that it the tariffs will not provoke a retaliation on American products Yeutter told Cable News Network Japan has far too much at stake in this relationship with the United States to seriously entertain thoughts of retaliation Yeutter said Earlier today Reagan imposed 100 pct tariffs on a range of Japanese goods in retaliation for Japans alleged violation of a bilateral pact governing semiconductor trade Yeutter did say that US farm products would be targeted if Tokyo decided to hit back If they Japan were to retaliate it would probably be on something like American agricultural products he said But I really think the chances of that happening are between slim and none he added

17452	The use of tariffs and quotas to reduce the flow of foreign goods into the United States will do little to cut the nations swelling trade deficit a government study said In fact the Federal Trade Commission FTC report said such protectionist policies could make US Products less competitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost of imported products that are re-exported in different forms Such policies are much more likely to hurt rather than help the productive capabilities of the US Economy it said The 218-page report written by FTC economists John Hilke and Philip Nelson blamed the rising trade shortfall which climbed to a record 1663 billion dlrs last year on shifting currency exchange rates and growing US consumer demand Other factors commonly blamed for the deficit such as foreign trade practices deteriorating US Industrial competitiveness high labour costs and government restrictions on mergers added little to the problem it said Although each industrys competitiveness affects the level of imports and exports in that industry in general we find that there have been no significant industry-specific changes affecting competitiveness that would explain the increase in the overall trade deficit the study said To the extent any government action is needed to deal with the trade deficits policies should focus on economy-wide phenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth the FTC study said Supporting its conclusion that broad-based economic shifts were the cause of the increase in the trade deficit the report said it found that nearly all US Industries lost some domestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s It also said it found a fairly direct relationship between the increased trade deficit and the influence of shifting currency exchange rates US Economic growth and domestic demand for goods and services which has outpaced foreign consumer demand The study examined seven factors which have been commonly blamed for the trade deficit foreign government subsidies and trade barriers to protect foreign industries a lack of investment in US Industry declining research and development in US Industry high labour costs union work rules the oil prices rises of the 1970s and US Antitrust regulations In each case the study found little or no evidence that the factor had any impact on the trade deficit

17670	A trade bill before the United States House of Representatives is a very dangerous bill for Canadian industry Canadian Forest Industry Council chairman Adam Zimmerman told reporters By changing the definition of subsidy under US countervailing duty law House of Representatives Bill 3 removes protection for companies that take advantage of widely used government programs Zimmerman told a media briefing Clearly any industry to which Canadian governments grant rights to fish mine cut timber or produce power could be vulnerable to a finding of a subsidy under this language he said The Canadian forest lobbys Zimmerman also said the House of Representative Bill would adopt a new way of measuring subsidies that would greatly increase the size of any countervailing duties that might be imposed on Canadian resource exports to the US Under the bill any difference between Canadian prices and US or world market prices would constitute a subsidy he said Such a method would make Canadian resource industries vulnerable to similar penalties like a 15 pct export tax imposed last January on shipments of Canadian softwood lumber to the US Zimmerman added Canadian negotiators agreed to levy the new tax if a US forest industry lobby would drop its request for a countervail duty on imports of Canadian softwood lumber We represent the first victim of the move to price other countries natural resources according to the US system Zimmerman said If were an example than other resource industries had better watch out he added Zimmerman said the Canadian Forest Industry Council plans to discuss concerns about the US trade bill with lobby groups from other Canadian resource industries
17871	The dollars recent signs of stability have raised hopes that its 27-month decline may be nearly over but most currency analysts refuse to commit themselves until after the June 12 release of US trade data for April The trade data will be a deciding factor to see if the dollar has bottomed out said Jim McGroarty of Discount Corp Since February 1985 the dollar has nearly halved its value against the yen and the mark as part of an officially orchestrated campaign to make US goods more competitive on world markets and redress gaping world trade imbalances On April 27 the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 13725 yen but has enjoyed a modest recovery over the last few weeks topping 145 yen today for the first time in nearly two months Many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen far enough to ease the trade deficits drag on the US economy The US trade gap narrowed to 136 billion dlrs in March from 151 billion in February and is expected to show continued improvement in April in volume if not in real terms Keiichi Udagawa of Bank of Tokyo in New York said that if further progress is reported the dollar would head back up towards 150 yen There is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomed out for the medium term added Tom Campbell of First National Bank of Chicago Other factors supporting this bullish view were growing expectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker would be reappointed for a third four-year term in August Japans larger-than-expected economic stimulus package last week and more favorably technical chart signals analysts said The dollar was also aided by Japans moves to dampen speculative selling in Tokyo and by reports of active central bank intervention to support the dollar The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last week that the US monetary authorities bought more than four billion dlrs during the February-April period -- the largest amount since the dollar crisis of the late 1970s Discount Corps McGroarty described the Feds intervention volume as impressive James ONeill of Marine Midland Bank was not so positive however the dollar has not yet bottomed out After the trade data are released the dollar could fall towards 177 marks and 140 yen Similarly Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank in New York warned I dont think the dollar has bottomed out yet Although the dollar could rise as high as 14650 yen Okada said market impatience about the painstakingly slow decline of the US trade deficit may lead to renewed pressure Currency analysts also warned about an unfavorable reaction to the seven-nation economic Summit on June 8 to 10 in Venice which is likely to focus on the implementation of previous commitments rather than yield any fresh initiatives President Reagan said today economic policy decisions made last year in Tokyo and at this years meetings of Group of Seven finance ministers in Paris and Washington cannot be ignored or forgotten The commitments made at these meetings need to be translated into action he added in a speech celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Marshall aid plan for Europe Now that Tokyo has unveiled its fiscal stimulus package analysts expected Bonn and the dollarmark rate to bear the brunt of US calls for further action Marine Midlands ONeill said pressure will build up on Germany to take stimulative action like Japan Some Japanese bank dealers warned that although the dollar could hold above 145 yen for some months it could also come under attack again if it seems the latest economic package is not having much impact on Japans economy and its trade surplus Reflecting a longer-term uncertainty some some trust banks and Japanese insurers are keeping their short dollar positons hedged against exchange losses in their foreign portfolios while some others have started covering those short positions Japanese bank dealers said

17948	Japan is disappointed at the recent threats of trade retaliation from the European Community EC just as the trade situation between the two is improving Japanese Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura said I am deeply concerned that the EC has moved to take a harsher line toward Japan despite this tangible improvement he said in a speech prepared for delivery at the opening of a new centre designed to improve understanding between the two sides Last week foreign ministers of the 12 EC nations agreed to impose tariffs on a range of unspecified Japanese electrical goods unless Tokyo opened its markets more to EC exports Tamura referred to a 55 pct rise in Japanese imports of EC manufactured goods in the year ended March 31 I feel this is a strong step on the road to balance through expansion While I do not deny the existence of the trade deficit between Japan and the EC I believe it should be rectified not by reducing trade through import restrictions or export restraints but by expanding the overall trade Tamura said

18257	President Reagan called for continued nondiscriminatory treatment for Romanian exports to the United States in the face of congressional opposition because of the Bucharest governments record on human rights A White House statement said Reagans decision to press for continuation of so-called Most Favored Nation MFN status for Romania had been exceptionally difficult and came after all options were seriously considered But the statement said that despite concerns about human rights abuses by the Bucharest government the president had decided that should be continued because it helped stimulate emigration from Romania and gave the United States influence on human rights practices there The statement was issued as Reagan sent to Congress requests for one-year extensions of MFN for Romania Hungary and China The House of Representatives has attached to a trade bill legislation that would temporarily deny MFN for Romania pending certification by Reagan that the country had made progress on human rights There is no controversy over continuation of MFN for Hungary and China
18302	With more private investment not more protection the US textile industry could become competitive with the most modern foreign producers analysts from two congressional agencies said today The Office of Technology Assessment a nonpartisan arm of Congress told a House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee hearing there was still concern for the future of parts of the US textile and apparel industry but there was more reason for optimism than a few years ago While textile producers are making significant investments they could do more OTA analyst Henry Kelly said The Congressional Budget Office CBO the nonpartisan budget analysis arm of Congress said federal loans or loan guarantees would be preferable options for Congress rather than increased trade protection which could lead to foreign retaliation CBO analyst Edward Gramlich said past trade protections first imposed in the 1950s have had only a small benefit for profits and investments of domestic firms Trade Subcommittee chairman Rep Sam Gibbons said the agencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion against congressional approval of protectionist textile quota legislation aimed mainly at Western Europe Japan and other Asian textile producing countries President Reagan last year vetoed a textile protection bill but it was reintroduced in this session of Congress and is expected to be voted on in the House this year However approval this year is in doubt because passage of a major trade bill without specific protections for textiles showed a weakening of support for the legislation Most US producers have fallen behind other foreign producers in the use of modern textile and apparel production equipment and net imports are growing faster than the domestic markets Kelly said He added that private investment in the textile and clothing industry in 1983 of 05 pct was less than one-seventh the average manufacturing investment of 39 pct Despite existing import quotas and tariffs imports of textiles grew 26 pct in 1986 and imports of apparel grew 14 pct while US production rose only 19 pct The traditional industry seems destined to be replaced by new technology imports or some combination of both While the industry may not be able to compete in all domestic markets that it enjoyed twenty years ago the results of our research indicate that portions of the domestic market can be recovered and that exports can be expanded Kelly said

18991	Japans trade surplus is likely to continue to grow in 1987 as sales of Japanese goods abroad increase while domestic demand remains sluggish the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD said In its latest half-yearly review of the world economy the OECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last year when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 while export markets rose by only two pct But it said this differential between the growth of domestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988 thus weakening the international adjustment process It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over two pct but with a rise in exports of 33 pct in 1987 and 36 pct in 1988 As a result the current account surplus in 1987 will rise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986 although in 1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6000 billion yen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand and increase imports to Japan However OECD officials said the measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand quite possibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects have worked through and thus will provide some stimulus to imports The OECD outlook said Continued large current account surpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantial net external asset position could well lead to upward pressure on the yen It said that further appreciation could then lead manufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus weaken domestic growth The OECD said Japans Gross National Product was likely to gorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988 below 1986s 25 pct growth But it said Japan would continue its good performance on inflation with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a 06 pct rise in consumer prices last year

16752	A 50 pct cut in the import tariff for soybeans should help boost 1987 US Soybean exports to Taiwan a spokesman for the joint committee of soybean importers told Reuters He said the cut to 35 from seven pct was approved by the cabinet yesterday and would go into effect within a week The cut will encourage local importers to increase 1987 soybean imports to 19 mln tonnes from 174 mln last year he said The previous target for 1987 was 181 tonnes Taiwan imports more than 90 pct of its soybeans from the US And the rest from South America The spokesman said the increase in imports from the US Is in line with government efforts to reduce Taiwans trade surplus with Washington which rose to 361 billion US Dlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from 278 billion a year ago The tariff cut is very helpful for American suppliers who want to boost their exports to Taiwan Steve Chen country director of the American Soybean Association told Reuters
17477	Philippine Coconut Authority PCA chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later this month to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community EC levy on vegetable oil imports I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is putting up this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countries like the Philippines Romero said in an interview He said he did not know how much support the levy had within the EC but he said he believed those originally opposed to the tax were under pressure to change their position Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany the Netherlands Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax But there was a danger some of them would be persuaded to change sides and if that happened opposition could crumble Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warning that copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained dangerous levels of aflatoxin a carcinogenic chemical He said the EC standard of 002 parts of aflatoxin per million parts of meal which EC countries had been asked to apply by October 1988 was too rigid He said Philippine copra cake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it is not properly dried or ground Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in London that the Philippines was doing its best to meet EC standards It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally but this was likely to take several years of research Copra meal exports were 817641 tonnes or 35 pct of total coconut exports in 1986 The meal was worth 735 mln dlrs Romero said he would also visit Oxford Universitys department of agricultural economics to discuss ways of avoiding the copra process altogether There are ways of producing coconut products outside of copra Romero said We can process fresh coconut without drying the meat in the sun Through the wet process we can process coconuts into other food or non-food products or we can go to the chemical root He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries to become more protectionist and he expected export prices of coconut products to drop In the long term we will be getting less and less for more and more production and Im not comfortable with that he said With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping up production of palm oil a coconut oil substitute palm oil output had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971 Romero said To add to that the US Soybean Association is spending billions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by saying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart he said Romero said he expected coconut product export prices to stay up for the rest of the year They would probably touch a high of 20 centspound from the current level of 1859 cents and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 1050 cents Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-year coconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall after two successive years of good harvests He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year to add to the production fall drought had affected output Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought the prices will start declining again The only sure way to keep prices stable is by processing adding more value he said Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by planting other cash crops between coconut trees he said A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on 10000 square metres of land Thats a lot of space Romero said He said the governments proposed land reform program would exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because they had less than the proposed seven-hectares of land If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels production and employment then it wont happen he said PCA figures show about one-third of the countrys population is dependent on the coconut industry Coconuts are planted on about 32 mln hectares or one-fourth of total agricultural land
17759	European Community EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen said his proposal for a tax of up to 330 European Currency Units per tonne on oils and fats was likely to go up for discussion at next weeks summit meeting of EC leaders EC farm ministers have been unable to agree the tax one of the main items proposed by Andriessen for the 1987-88 farm price package The tax which would apply on both domestically-produced and imported oils and fats has been fiercely opposed by the United States and developing countries vegetable and marine oil producers
18150	Developing countries said the European Community EC would breach two international agreements if it went ahead with its plans for an oils and fats tax Ambassadors to the EC from African Caribbean and Pacific ACP states told a press conference the tax would hit the exports of 26 ACP countries They said the EC failed to follow consultation procedures laid down in the Lome Convention which regulates relations between ACP states and the bloc for moves which could affect trade between the two sides They also said the EC would be in breach of an undertaking not to bring in new protectionist measures during the current Punta del Este round of world trade negotiations being held under GATT General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade auspices The EC Commission has proposed a tax of up to 330 European currency units Ecus a tonne on both imported and EC-produced vegetable and marine fats for human consumption which could raise up to two billion Ecus a year EC farm ministers who would have to approve such a tax are split on the issue and are expected to decide it at a marathon meeting on EC farm prices beginning in Luxembourg on June 15 Jamaican ambassador Leslie Wilson said ACP countries are convinced this would lead to EC industry substituting products made within the bloc for oil and fat imports The ACP estimates this would result in a fall of 160 to 185 mln Ecus in its member country exports We cant believe the EC would willingly take measures to undermine our countries but such would be the impact of these measures Wilson said The US and Malaysia say their exports would also be hit by the proposed tax and they may take retaliatory action if it is approved Wilson said the ACP would take such steps only as a very last resort but added that the ACP is in touch with other countries which oppose the plan Wilson who was chairing the news conference made it clear Jamaica itself would not be hit by the tax as it does not export oils and fats Among the worst hit countries would be Ivory Coast Senegal Nigeria and Papua New Guinea the ACP says
18565	Dutch parliamentary parties have re-affirmed their support for the governments opposition to the proposed European Community tax on oils and fats parliamentarians said A broad cross-section of members of parliament voiced their opposition to the tax during a debate in the lower house yesterday on the basis of possible retaliation from the US And on the potentially damaging effect on Third World countries State Secretary for Foreign Affairs Rene Van Der Linden said the government was against the tax although it noted deepening EC financial difficulties It is difficult to be against the tax and against extra finance The EC members have to make a choice Van Der Linden said However he denied the government had dropped its opposition to the proposed tax or altered its position
18599	A minority group of European Community countries strong enough to block the adoption of a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats is still intact after the EC Commission proposed changes to its proposals earlier today British agriculture minister John MacGregor told journalists He said Britain West Germany the Netherlands and Denmark continue to oppose the tax after the Commission proposed making it temporary and promising compensation to any third countries whose exports suffered
18700	Dutch consumers and food processors would be hit hard by the proposed EC tax on oils and fats Dick de Bruyn chairman of the commodity board for margarine fats and oils MVO said at the annual meeting The Dutch are the second largest consumers of margarine and fourth largest consumers of vegetable oils in the EC The fiercely contested tax would be a levy on consumers and steeply increase the costs of industries such as potato processing and cake and biscuit manufacturing de Bruyn said A move by these industries to countries outside the EC cannot be ruled out he added De Bruyn said the tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats would be wide open to fraud difficult to police and hugely expensive administratively He also said the proposed tax contravened not only article three of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade GATT the Lome Convention and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization FAO guidelines but also the ECs own Treaty The proposed tax would not only be inflationary but also have consequences for employment and investment he added
18744	A spokesman for the European Community Commission defended the controversial plan for a levy on oils and fats saying that consumers would have to help alleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax Norbert Tanghe head of division of the Commissions Directorate General for Agriculture told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days the Commission firmly believes that the sacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers in the oils and fats sector  Would justify asking consumers to make an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem within that sector by paying a levy The proposed tax is necessary because the level of budgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds production has become unacceptable Tanghe said Recent estimates put these costs at 40 billion European Currency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 20 billion Ecus he said In 1990 the Communitys standstill agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would then feel the full impact of its enlargement The Commission has proposed several cost and production cutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum guaranteed quantity system he added Under the Commissions system for stabilising consumer prices in the oils and fats sector a reference price of 700 Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced Tanghe said Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory amount when market prices are below or above this level He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory amount would be used to finance the Common Agricultural Policys oils and fats regime The Commission believes that hostile reactions to the proposed tax have for the most part been based on incomplete or an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal he said Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade GATT rules It would not be discriminatory because it would be applied to domestic and imported products and past experience showed it would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do under present aid arrangements he said The competitiveness between different oils whether EC produced or imported would remain unchanged and quantities imported from third countries would not be affected by the tax Tanghe said The proposed system would not alter the EC nations requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall effect would stabilise Community production levels without affecting demand he said It is one of the proposals objectives to maintain current import levels he said Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are imported primarily to satisfy the ECs cakes and meals requirements which are not covered by the stabilising system Furthermore more than half the oil produced from imported beans is re-exported to third countries Tanghe added

15893	The US Agriculture Department increased its estimate of 198687 grain purchases by the Soviet Union to 28 mln tonnes up two mln tonnes from last month In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation the USDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated because Soviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the last month USDA said the increased purchasing is somewhat surprising because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn USDA said Of the 28 mln tonnes total 15 mln tonnes will be wheat 12 mln tonnes coarse grains and the remaining one mln tonnes miscellaneous grains and pulses USDA said USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop suffered through a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed The severe winter is believed to have resulted in above average winter-kill USDA said Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter losses maybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buying grain recently USDA said Moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnes grain for delivery in 198687 including 14 mln tonnes wheat and 12 mln tonnes coarse grain

15549	The United States which has long sought Japanese action to stimulate its economy appears to be satisfied Tokyos latest package is a major development and allows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement to stabilize currencies Monetary sources said they believed that US Treasury Secretary James Baker considered Tokyos package announced yesterday to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy But yesterdays statement by seven leading industrial powers endorses the yens rise from around 153 to the dollar the level at the February 22 Paris Accord to about 145 today And the initial reaction of currency markets in the Far East demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced that currencies yet reflect economic fundamentals even though the countries appear to do so The yen sank below 145 at one point despite intervention by the Bank of Japan Kiichi Miyazawa Japans Finance Minister said the movement since Paris was consistent with currency trading ranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks I would say that what has happened to the yen in the past several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the discussions in Paris Miyazawa said yesterday The supplementary budget worth about 3448 billion dlrs was announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of Miyazawas departure for Washington to attend yesterdays meetings of leading industrial nations In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action extraordinary and urgent the meeting reaffirmed the Paris Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals or economic reality The Group of Seven -- the United States Japan West Germany France Britain Italy and Canada -- therefore repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to foster exchange rate stability The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central bank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the dollars fall While relatively unsuccessful the scale of intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent years Monetary sources also said they understood that Secretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely successful in the light of the Japanese announcement They also said there was a growing feeling among the finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over medium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term differences in past meetings West Germany whose currency has not risen anything like the yen since the Paris Agreement appears from the face of yesterdays statement to have won acceptance from other countries that its exchange rate is acceptable Bonns finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance between West Germany and Japans trade surpluses and Americas trade deficit have already taken place No mention was made however of the US commitment to cut the budget deficit even though it is implied in the reafffirmation of Paris European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are essential to curbing the record US trade shortfall that reached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this week by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker A further sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would clearly pose substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could undermine confidence in future financial stability he said Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the politically independent Fed to drive up interest rates Monetary sources said that privately West Germany welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own currency remained relatively stable against the US unit Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak dollar blunts Tokyos export drive to the United States the Japanese monolith will concentrate on European markets The ministers meanwhile also continued talks on making their policy coordination more binding and one Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson said good progress was made Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations The United States and France backed by the International Monetary Fund want the seven to agree on ranges or norms for a limited number of economic objectives such as growth inflation monetary conditions trade balances and current account balances Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in consultations between the countries on whether corrective action should be required But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives has Bonn and London worried monetary sources say because it implies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit currency fluctuations just before the February meeting The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges of the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the relatively free currency markets of recent years

19061	Japan could avoid a sharp rise in the value of the yen against the dollar if Japan the US And other nations succeeded in restructuring their economies an advisory panel to the governments Economic Planning Agency EPA said The advisory body said in its report that the yen would soar against the dollar if structural adjustments on a global basis were delayed An EPA official told Reuters the dollar could fall to slightly below 100 yen by 1993 if Japan and the US Failed to restructure their economies The dollars fall without structural adjustments would cut Japans current account surplus to two pct of gross national product GNP in 1993 the report said It said such a change would slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annually during the seven-year period to 1993 If the two nations restructured their economies the dollar would remain stable in real terms while reducing Japans current-account surplus to 21 pct of GNP in 1993 This scenario put Japans GNP growth at 35 pct a year It forecast real growth of three pct for the world economy and four pct for Japan by 2000 if the adjustments were made
