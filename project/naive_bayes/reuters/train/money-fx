247	Gulf money markets have grown reasonably well during the past decade but bond and stock markets remain to a large extent fragmented and lag behind ltGulf International Bank BSC GIB said The banks economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulf capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional investment vehicles such as real estate foreign currency bank accounts and precious metals Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the disclosure requirements on company accounts he said The GIB study reviewed capital markets under three categories -- money markets stock and bond markets Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use of short-term money market instruments and banks in the region had floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities Nevertheless bond and stock markets remain to a large extent fragmented and lagging behind he said Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of stock or bond issues Only Kuwait has an official stock exchange while other Gulf nations have yet to establish exchanges But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital markets and set up domestic stock exchanges Azzam said He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital markets in the region In addition family firms are reluctant to go public financial awareness among investors is still lacking and investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack depth A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some Gulf countries and authorities apparent reluctance to adopt financial innovations had also hampered capital markets He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments Azzam said capital market instruments should be made available to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation Council GCC states -- Bahrain Kuwait Qatar Oman Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates UAE Some moves had been taken in this direction with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depth from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain and the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in Saudi Arabia But he added there is no bond market to speak of in Saudi Arabia Qatar Oman or the UAE with the last Saudi riyal denominated bond issued in 1978 While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading in Saudi Arabia has picked up establishment of formal exchanges in Qatar Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent Azzam said

1553	The Federal Reserve Board voted unanimously to propose a formula for calculating the risk of interest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effort to come up with a new capital standard for US banks that takes into account the riskiness of a banks loans and other assets Fed officials said an identical proposal was being issues today by the Bank of England The Fed set a 60-day period for public comment on the plan The proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks associated with interest rate swaps forward foreign exchange contracts and similar financial instruments Previously the Fed Jan 8 proposed a series of guidelines for calculating the risk of other off-balance-sheet activities that banks would be required to take into account in calculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to maintain Both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans and other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk that would establish a banks minimum capital needs The additional guidelines proposed today would determine the amount of capital support required for a banks current exposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure The current exposure would be measured by the mark-to-market value of the asset which would reflect the replacement cost Potential future increases in the replacement cost would be calculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical analyses by the staffs of the Bank of England and US banking regulators Future exposure would rise over the life of the asset The Fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance conflicting needs for precision and simplicity They ignore for example the relative volatility of the particular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts Board officials said the new gauge could increase the capital required of the largest money center banks which are the principal participants in these types of activities They cautioned the Fed board to take account of the potential impact of the plan on the ability of US banks to compete in world financial markets However the staff concluded The credit risks inherent in such contracts now constitute a significant element of the risk profiles of some banking organizations The Fed proposal would exempt all but the 20-25 largest participants in this market on grounds the benefits of including the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs Also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange contracts traded on organized exchanges Governor Martha Seger said she was concerned that Japan was not involved in the UK-US effort to draft new capital rules
1560	The Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve Board have agreed new proposals for joint standards to measure the risk of an array of credit exposures that do not show up in bank balance sheets the Bank of England said The plan covering swaps forward contracts and options involving interest or exchange rates complements proposals agreed in January between the two central banks to make commercial banks in the US And Britain subject to similar standards for measuring capital adequacy the proposal said It said no final decisions had been reached yet and banks have until April 16 to comment on the trunk proposals The Bank of England and Fed said they had faced a dilemma On the one hand we are determined to require adequate capital support for potential future exposure -- on the other hand we are concerned that overly stringent capital requirements might unnecessarily affect the ability of US And UK Banking organisations to priceContracts competitively At the basis of the new proposals lies the concept of the so-called credit equivalent amount - the current value of a currency or interest rate contract and an estimate of its potential change in value due to currency or interest rate fluctuations until the contract matures In treatment similar to that agreed in January for balance sheet assets the credit equivalent will be assigned one of five risk weights between zero and 100 pct depending on the quality of the counterparty the remaining maturity of the contract and on collaterals or guarantees to the contract the plans showed The proposal showed that collaterals and guarantees would not be recognised in calculating credit equivalent amounts They would however be reflected in the assignment of risk weights The only guarantees recognised are those given by US And UK Governments or in the US By domestic national government agencies the proposals showed The paper said the proposed rules would not cover spot foreign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures and options exchanges It said US Regulatory authorities and the Bank of England were keen to encourage banks to net contracts -- consolidate multiple contracts with the same counterparty into one single agreement to create one single payments stream It recognised that such arrangements may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk and wish to encourage their further development and implementation and said some of the current proposals may be changed to take this into account The paper said the proposed rules would not cover spot foreign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures and options exchanges It said US Regulatory authorities and the Bank of England were keen to encourage banks to net contracts -- consolidate multiple contracts with the same counterparty into one single agreement to create one single payments stream It recognised that such arrangements may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk and wish to encourage their further development and implementation and said some of the current proposals may be changed to take this into account
1724	US and UK bank regulators are asking banks to set aside more reserves than is necessary to cushion them against the risks posed by the interest rate and currency swap transactions they carry swap dealers said After viewing proposed guidelines released jointly today by the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board dealers said that in effect regulators are asking them to set aside reserves twice for the same risk Market participants will have 60 days to respond to the proposals Adoption of stiffer capital requirements is especially significant in the eurobond markets which saw new issue volume of about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiled by Euromoney magazine While no firm figures exist dealers in eurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved in some swap arrangement Separately the ISDA estimates that about 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are outstanding Kenneth McCormick co-chairman of the International Swap Dealers Association ISDA and President of Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc said that the Association has no comment and will study the proposals What they are proposing is really double counting Patrick de Saint-Aignan managing director of swaps for Morgan Stanley and Co said Instead he argues banks should either be required to hold a percentage of the face value -- say one pct per year to maturity -- or to hold a percentage of the cost of replacing the contract in the event of a counterparty default The potential risk factors are very large relative to what we had expected said a director at one UK merchant bank What they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now --to borrow money now -- to cushion you against risk you might have 10 years from now he addedAdds title first paragraph Dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by the agreement such as those based in Japan will have a competitive advantage because they will not have to pass the costs on to customers Indeed regulators are apparently also concerned about the exclusion of other countries from the new requirements Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger following approval of the proposed guidelines by the Fed said she is concerned that Japan was not involved in the UK-US effort to draft new capital rules Dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank regulators recognized the concept of netting that is offsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a single counterparty against each other The paper said that regulatory authorities recognize that such arrangements netting may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk Furthermore the paper said if a netting agreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests it might be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly But dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an airtight netting agreement that is impossible to design One problem is that there has never been a major default in the swaps market So we dont know if any of the swap arrangements will really stand up in court said one bank official

1926	The highly visible drama involving the yens sharp rise against the US Dollar is obscuring the fact that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major European currencies thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions Japanese and European research officials said The officials looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the Group of Five G-5 industrial nations told Reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the Japan-US Trade axis into a Japan-European Community EC axis to the discomfort of Europe In many ways not least in terms of rare international cooperation the September 1985 New York Plaza pact between the US Japan West Germany Britain and France to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture in which the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance but not necessarily central significance the officials said The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took place the dollar was already on its way down The agreement simply helped it on its way Senior EC financial expert in Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely You have to look at the dollars peak compared with now and that was well before Plaza he said On February 25 1985 the dollar peaked against the yen at 26315 yen On September 20 the Friday before Plaza it was 242 Since then despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action the dollar trend has been down down down Yet the ECU is now around 1734 yen The historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story The European currencies are moving back up against the yen The close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing In 1986 Japanese imports and exports with the EC both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms five pct in yen This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus Last January Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of of sales to the US against about a third in recent years Trade with the US in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to Europe where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms which is what is important to them Suddenly instead of the US It is Europe that is laying the golden egg said de Hora The EC is worried EC business also had a remarkable year in Japanese sales but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base compared with total Japan-US Trade The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than US Firms a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance and which will cause problems This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries But therefore Japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge said Azusa Hayashi Director of the First International Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry If you want my objective view I dont expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance Last year we asked for moderation in exports and this year we may have to do so again he said

10344	Recent slackness on Dutch capital markets has led some bankers to question the Central Banks policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the West German mark and to ask for more flexiblility in exchange rate policy While agreeing with the Banks commitment to defend the guilder strongly some bankers want the Bank to make more use of the range within which the guilder and the mark can fluctuate against each other in the European Monetary System EMS Roelof Nelissen chairman of Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV Amro said the Central Banks policy was overcautious I would like to suggest that the Bank use more freely the range given to the guilder in the EMS Nelissen said at the presentation of Amros 1986 annual report last week Within the EMS the mark is allowed to fluctuate against the guilder between 1101675 and 115235 guilders per 100 The Central Bank maintains a stricter policy and tries to keep the mark below the 11300 guilders per 100 It regards a stable exchange rate as its main target using interest rate policies to influence the exchange rate The preference of exchange rate goals above interest rate aims goes almost undisputed in the Netherlands Critics say the Bank keeps the reins unnecessarily short Rabobank Nederland said in its latest economic bulletin By maintaining the 11300 limit the Central Bank raises the expectation it will always intervene above that level If it suddenly needs more flexibility it will find it very hard to obtain Amros Nelissen said relatively small changes in interest rates and exchange rates could cause substantial flows of securities business and sharp fluctuations on the Dutch capital market Large interest rate changes were often needed to bring about small changes in the guildermark exchange rate he added Unlike Amro Algemene Bank Nederland NV ABN says this is a price the Dutch have to pay It fully agrees with the Central Banks policy director-general Julien Geertsema told Reuters noting a 1983 decision not to revalue the guilder fully with the mark in the EMS hurt confidence in the Dutch currency It is a pity we need such a wide interest rate difference between West Germany to maintain the exchange rate he added Interest rate differentials between West Germany and the Netherlands are the main factors that trigger capital flows between the two countries as the economic performance of the two does not differ much economists said Data on 1986 capital flows between West Germany and the Netherlands have not yet been released but in 1985 they accounted for only 10 pct of total trade flows between the two countries put at 110 billion guilders for 1986 by the Dutch-German Chamber of Commerce earlier this month Economists say capital flows are more sensitive to interest and exchange rates West Germany is the Netherlands largest single trading partner taking 28 pct of Dutch exports and providing 26 pct of imports in the last quarter of 1986 Central Bureau of Statistics figures show At the moment the rates for three month euromark deposits trade around 40 pct while the same deposits in guilders have a rate of around 5-716 pct Amro bank argues that the Dutch real interest rate will even rise further because of expectations of deflation here in 1987 contrasting with slight inflation in West Germany In the Netherlands the cost of living is expected to decrease by 15 pct at a GNP growth rate of two pct the Dutch Central Planning Agency said in its 1987 forecast last month German GNP is seen rising by two to 25 pct but with inflation between zero and 10 pct according to most German forecasts But despite this upward push on real Dutch rates money dealers do not expect the Central Bank to cut official rates independently without prior moves by the Bundesbank Following the West German interest rate cuts on January 22 the Dutch Central Bank did not lower its rates but set a 05 pct lower tariff for special advances and abandoned its credit surcharge Most traders were surprised by this move as they had expected the Bank to follow suit unconditionally they said The Bank said it lowered the rate with the largest impact on the money market as far as the exchange rate permitted While not entirely unsympathetic to critics of its policies the Central Bank keeps its grip firm and the range narrow The European Monetary System is not only a relationship between the guilder and the mark Many times widening of the margin between the two would implicate we have to buy or sell large amounts of a third currency Central Bank vice-director Jan-Hendrik Du Marchie Sarvaas said If we allowed the guilder to become a little cheaper the markets would start to believe it was weak We dont want that We want to make clear that the guilder is just as strong as the mark he said

10617	A leading US Banker said the dollar was likely to fall another five to 10 pct this year and an improvement in the huge American trade deficit would be only temporary at current world exchange rate levels Kurt Viermetz Worldwide Treasurer of ltMorgan Guaranty Trust Co told Arab currency traders meeting here that the steady depreciation of the dollar had not gone far enough to rein in US Deficits on a lasting basis Speaking at the 14th annual congress of the Interarab Cambist Association Viermetz said an agreement reached last month among major industrial nations to steady the dollar around current levels left many questions unanswered I cannot see any chance for a real turnaround rise in the dollar Viermetz said I believe there is room for a further fall of five to 10 per cent in 1987 The United States West Germany Japan France Great Britain and Canada -- G-6 -- agreed in Paris in late February to stabilise major currencies around current levels The accord came after months of transatlantic argument with Tokyo and Bonn claiming Washingtons policy of talking the dollar lower had made life impossible for West German and Japanese exporters The Paris accord also brought a pause to the continued slide of the dollar engineered by a meeting in New York in September 1985 when industrial nations agreed to depress the value of the currency to help redress global trade imbalances But Viermetz said Morgan Guarantys economic models showed that with no further change in exchange rates -- and continued sluggish growth in West Germany and Japan -- the US Trade deficit would improve only temporarily He said the deficit might fall to 145 billion dlrs this year from 165 billion in 1986 and further improve to 120 billion in 1988 but by 1990 it would be back around 160 billion dlrs This is clearly unacceptable for the monetary authorities and politicians in Washington he said Viermetz said it was only natural that markets should attempt to test the credibility of the Paris accord struck when the dollar was trading at about 183 marks and 15250 yen Immediately before the historic 1985 New York agreement or Plaza Accord the dollar had been trading at 284 marks and 240 yen Viermetz said he believed major nations in Paris wanted to see the dollar hold within a loose range of 175 to 190 marks and 145 to 155 yen with any attempt to push the US Currency lower being countered by central bank intervention The dollar ended in New York yesterday at 1471525 yen --its lowest level against the Japanese currency in roughly 40 years It closed at 1816070 marks Viermetz also said he did not see the US Federal funds rate falling below six pct for fear of provoking an uncontrolled fall in the dollar But at the same time worries about the international debt crisis would mean there was little chance of a rise above 6-34 pct since this would increase loan costs to the third world The Middle East foreign exchange conference brings together more than 200 traders and bank treasury chiefs from the Arab world and Arab banks in European and US Financial centres Formal discussions which end today have also centred on the role of Arab banks in world financial markets with bankers urging them to adapt to a new global trend towards securitisation of  business Hikmat Nashashibi President of the Arab Bankers Association said Arab banks have to shake off their old mentality of commercial banking and concentrate more on investment banking

10704	Bahrain is introducing a new domestic money market regime to provide dinar liquidity aid centred on the islands newly launched treasury bill programme The Bahrain Monetary Agency has issued a circular to all commercial banks outlining a new policy from April 1 which gives liquidity aid through sale and repurchase agreements in treasury bills or through discounting them The circular released officially to Reuters said current arrangements for providing liquidity aid will no longer be valid except in quite exceptional circumstances Under the current system the agency provides the islands 20 commercial banks with dinar liquidity by means of short-term swaps against US Dollars and less frequently by short-term loans secured against government development bonds The agency considers that it is now appropriate to replace these operations with short-term assistance based on Government of Bahrain treasury bills the circular to banks states The agency said it will repurchase treasury bills with a simultaneous agreement to resell them to the same bank at a higher price which will reflect an interest charge The agency said it envisages the repurchase agreements will normally be for a period of seven days Bahrain launched a weekly tender for two mln dinars of 91-day treasury bills in mid-December last year and has since raised a total of 26 mln dinars through the programme Bahrains commercial banks are currently liquid and have been making little use of the traditional dollar swaps offered by the agency But banking sources said the new regime from April 1 will mean banks cannot afford not to hold treasury bills in case they need funds from the central bank Banking sources said more than half of the 20 banks hold treasury bills although the need by others to take up paper could increase demand at weekly tenders and push down allotted yields slightly Last weeks yield was six pct although the programme had started at the end of last year with rates as low as 560 pct Banking sources said the cost of liquidity through repurchase accords will not differ much from that on dollar swaps But a bank using dollars to obtain liquidity would foresake interest on the US Currency while the underlying treasury bill investment is unaffected in a repurchase accord

10780	In a bid to hasten Japans promise to speed up its economic growth and open markets to foreign trade top US officials appear once again to have signaled their tolerance of a lower dollar Treasury Secretary James Baker and one of his top aides Assistant Secretary David Mulford said last week there was no target for the dollar a statement that sent the yen soaring against the dollar despite massive central bank intervention That was no slip of the tongue said one western monetary official who asked not to be identified For now the strategy appears to be working Japanese officials said late last week a package to bolster domestic demand will be ready in early April Until last week there were few indications the package would be ready anytime soon The Reagan administration facing an uproar in Congress over the apparent lack of progress in cutting the 1698 billion dlr trade deficit is learning now that to extract results from Japan dramatic action is required Last week the White House imposed unprecedented tariffs on certain Japanese electronic goods after Tokyo failed to adhere to a semi-conductor pricing accord between the two countries The shift in US strategy in part designed to appease mounting Congressional anger over Japanese policies comes just two weeks before industrial nations reconvene here to review the Paris agreement to stabilize currencies And news that Japan earned a record 18 billion dlr trade surplus in the first two months this year just underscored the need for urgent action in the view of US officials Nonetheless US officials see signs of improvement in the deficit Id be stunned if we were not going to derive some benefits from the lower dollar soon said one In Paris leading industrial nations agreed to cooperate closely to foster currency stability within ranges reflecting underlying economic fundamentals or economic reality The agreement envisages those fundamentals to include Japan and West Germany stimulating their economies and the United States cutting its budget deficit The three nations joined by France Britain and Canada agree these policies are essential to redress huge global trade imbalances But analysts say markets have signalled the underlying fundamentals imply a lower dollar rather than a stable one Markets in effect are less confident than governments that these measures -- including US budget deficit cuts agreed by Congress and the White House --will be carried out Nonetheless the dollars sharp fall has not undermined cooperation A US economic policymaker said the accord was on track and Tokyo and Bonn seem to want more stimulative measures which is what the Paris accord calls for International monetary sources said exchange market developments generally have not unsettled policymakers although Japan is an obvious exception Everybody feels it can still be managed one source said of market developments But last week the Bank of Japan spent an estimated five billion dlrs intervening to halt the rise in the yen and other central banks about one billion dlrs Another monetary source said Japan was upset with Americas half-hearted attempt to halt the falling dollar flouting the Paris accord outright The source close to the top levels of Japanese economic policymaking said Japans understanding of the accord was that the yen would be kept at around 154 to the dollar the level it stood at when the accord was struck The source said Tokyo was extremely worried by Washingtons use of the exchange rate to change Japanese policies It was a pointed reminder to Japan to do something about the trade issues the source said of the dollars fall against the yen By departing last Sunday from the language of the Paris accord -- that nations agreed to foster currency stability around current levels -- Baker triggered a run on the dollar Later in the week Mulford too said there was no target for the dollar and called on Japan and West Germany to live up to their international responsibilities and stimulate growth But US officials said recent market developments will not unravel the spirit of the Paris agreement Theres a realisation now that you cannot leave things alone everyone agrees that the external trade imbalances ought to be adjusted one official said While no-one is going to cede national sovereignty we certainly seem to be moving towards much closer co-operation another US official said The officials said the meeting here where the six will be joined by Italy will be a status report Japan will have to explain what the state of their program is and Germany will report on its plans Maybe theres a need to move faster one source said Mulford told Congress last week the Paris accord called in effect for currency stability for several months This would buy time for Japan and West Germany to speed up their economic growth and help bring down the US trade deficit His comments appeared to serve notice on other major nations that Washington cannot wait too long for action to reduce the gap between the Japanese and German trade surpluses and the US trade deficit

11753	The complex task of wielding control over monetary policy in an increasingly fast-moving global economy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices the newest member of the Federal Reserve Board says Commodity prices are already considered by the Fed in the making of monetary policy But they would be given a much greater role under an idea being floated by Governor Robert Heller who joined the board last August He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed but argues that such an arrangement particularly if it were adopted by other major industrial countries could reduce the volatility of exchange rates Moreover it could help stabilize of the prices of commodities themselves slowing changes in inflation His idea which many conservative economists find appealing has some backing among board members appointed in recent years by President Reagan It would complement the present system of opening or closing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation key indicators such as unemployment and the rise or fall of the money supply Changes in the money supply can lead to changes in interest rates and affect economic activity directly Discussed on and off for a long time the commodity concept is part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary policy and widely-fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid base What is needed is an anchor or reference point that can serve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary purposes says Heller In the past this anchor was gold but the United States went off the gold standard because the global economy had vastly outstripped gold supplies A return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of hand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest producers of gold are the Soviet Union and South Africa The so-called fixed rate system scuttled in the early 1970s is still considered unworkable in the present world But the current system of floating currencies in which currencies can fluxtuate widely adding vast pressures to the monetary system is also being widely questioned Some have suggested that the system might benefit from a formal approach that mandates intervention by countries when currencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are major problems with this also For one thing there is justifiable concern that countries might be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be detrimental to their own domestic economy Moreover some question whether concerted intervention can make much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree with the fundamental judgement The poorest countries have called for a monetary conference to work out a new system that not surprisingly helps them cope with their overpowering debt problems Treasury Secretary James Baker the Reagan administrations chief economic architect has preferred to use the so-called Group of Five industrial countries or sometimes Seven as a forum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other economic matters He appears convinced that officials from West Germany France Britain Japan Italy and Canada talking quietly behind closed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public posturing The Heller approach while extremely complex could have a profound impact on the system ideally stabalizing prices and international exchange rates As envisioned by Heller a basket of say 30 major commodities ranging from wheat to oil would be put together and prices would be measured on a regular basis In times of rising commodity prices monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices montary policy might be eased he says He notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction markets and a commodity price index can be calculated on a virtually continuous basis Moreover most commodity prices are produced consumed and traded on a world-wide basis so that an index has a relevance for the entire world he says In addition commodity prices are at the beginning of the production chain and serve as an imput into virtually all production processes Focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive indicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures the monetary authorities may take such an index into account in making their monetary policy decisions he says However he says that any major change in a basic commodity such as occurred in oil during the 1970s because of action by the OPEC cartel would have to be discounted in such a system He says the worst thing that could happen is to allow monetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity to the rest of the system and to other commodities

12136	The dollars recent decline despite massive central bank purchases is a forceful reminder that official intervention in the foreign exchanges can work only if it is well-timed to coincide with shifts in market fundamentals or sentiment dealers and analysts said Central banks may succeed in slowing a trend but without accompanying policy changes they stand little chance of reversing the direction of an ever-growing global market in which more than 200 billion dlrs is traded every day the sources said Timing and psychology are the key to successful intervention said Jim ONeill a financial markets economist with Marine Midland Banks Inc The importance of complementary changes in economic fundamentals was underlined yesterday when a change in interest rates boosted the dollar instantly achieving what the central banks had tried in vain to do for a week through open market intervention After Citibank raised its prime rate by a quarter-point to 7-34 pct the first change in the rate since last August the dollar started to advance and reached a high in Tokyo of 14750 yen up two yen from Tuesdays New York low By contrast monetary authorities spearheaded by the Bank of Japan are estimated to have bought as much as 10 billion dlrs in the last 10 days of March but could not prevent the dollar from skidding through 150 yen and plumbing a 40-year low Monday of 14470 yen Some experts worry the central banks have lost more than just a temporary battle to prop up the dollar The market is wary of being caught wrong-footed by a central bank foray but is no longer mesmerized Theyve lost their credibility The market feels it can take on the central banks and win said Michael Snow head of treasury operations at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York The relative failure of recent intervention stands in sharp contrast to the success that central banks scored when they joined forces to drive the dollar down following the September 22 1985 Plaza accord Then however central banks had an easy time of it because the markets and the Treasuries of the major industrial powers were agreed that the dollar needed to head lower to redress massive worldwide trade imbalances Now there is no such consensus The market is saying that the dollar must fall further because the US trade deficit is showing little sign of improvement while Japan is resisting in a bid to protect its export industries For its part the United States is apparently content to let the dollar fall gradually further and is paying little more than lip service to the February Paris agreement of the Group of Five plus Canada to foster stability dealers say Specifically they said the Feds dollar-buying intervention has been half-hearted designed more as a political gesture to Japan than to strike fear into the markets Its been pro-forma intervention said Francoise Soares-Kemp chief corporate trader at Credit Lyonnais Because of this discord and the markets momentum for a lower dollar analysts said intervention looks doomed to fail Its going to take a lot more than the central banks to hold the dollar at these levels said Snow who predicts another 10 to 15 pct depreciation There have to be structural changes that occur to make the market stop selling dollars added Buying six billion dollars in three weeks is not going to do it Late last decade during the presidency of Jimmy Carter when the dollar was last under heavy speculative attack central banks sometimes intervened to the tune of six billion dlrs in a single day but still failed to stop the dollar falling to a record low of 170 marks analysts said Snow said purchases on that scale now are unlikely I dont think anybody has the stomach for it because they saw the futility of it in the seventies Indeed because the market has grown in leaps and bound since then intervention on an even greater scale would probably be needed to impress the market Trading volume in London New York and Tokyo alone last year averaged nearly 188 billion dlrs a day according to a joint central bank study about double the previous estimate made just two years earlier by the Group of Thirty private research group There are signs that central banks too realize the futility of swimming against the tide Bank of Japan sources told Reuters in Tokyo earlier this week that they believed the limits of currency market intervention are perhaps being reached and that other methods for bolstering the dollar such as invoking currency swap agreements with other central banks are being considered In this era of financial liberalization its almost impossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan one senior official in Tokyo said

12447	Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawsons remarks yesterday suggesting there are precise exchange rate targets for the pound undermined sterling dashing hopes for an early cut in UK Base rates analysts said But the markets reaction testing exchange rate levels indicated by Lawson was probably overdone and the longer term outlook for sterling remained bullish they agreed In an apparent break with the previous policy of secrecy Lawson told a National Economic Development Council meeting he was comfortable with sterling exchange rates around current levels specifying rates of around 190 marks and 160 dlrs Lawson added the UK Government intended to keep sterling at about present levels using currency intervention and interest rates to achieve this The February 22 Paris agreement of the Group of Five and Canada to stabilise exchange rates is widely believed to include target ranges but all participants to the meeting had so far refused to specify these Markets were quick to react to the statement chopping about one US Cent and over one pfennig off the pound to match the levels mentioned by Lawson But most analysts polled said they did not believe Lawsons statement signalled a change in UK Policy Keith Skeoch chief economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co said the remarks have been blown out of proportion Lawson is paying now for a little bit of a slip of the tongue Barclays de Zoete Wedd economist Mark Brett said there is nothing great and fantastic in the Chancellors statement He said he did not believe the rates indicated by the Chancellor were precise targets but merely represented central rates around which sterling would be allowed to fluctuate perhaps by as much as 10 pct It would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of an election  I dont believe Lawson is mad enough to tie himself to a fixed rate Brett said Currency markets were keen for official statements to clarify the scope of the Paris accord and reactivate currency trading This mood easily led to over-reaction analysts said Making similar statements when the market is high strung and ready to bounce is perhaps a mistake one senior dealer with a US Bank said Capels Skeoch said it gives the foreign exchange markets something to shoot at It is obvious that the government as a member of the Group of Six has agreed exchange rate bands But they are not cut in stone they can change with time Skeoch said Brett said we think the 290 marks level is a central rate Give or take 10 pfennigs and all is fine Not all analysts played down the significance of the remarks however Chris Dunn economist at Royal Bank of Canada said the remarks may signal a decisive move to insulate sterling from the fortunes of the dollar Although about two-thirds of Britains trade is conducted with European countries sterling has traditionally shadowed the dollar rather than the mark analysts noted Britain must decide whether it wants to follow the US Or throw in its lot with Europe Dunn said It suggests that while the UK Is not actually applying to join the European Monetary System it is seeking protection by shadowing it  The Bundesbank has made it clear that it wants the UK To clarify its position relative to the mark he said Analysts said sterlings dip on currency markets following Lawsons remarks made an early half-point cut in UK Base rates from current 10 pct levels unlikely in the short term Over the next three weeks a cut is out unless we get some extremely good economic indicators Capels Skeoch said Base rates have been cut twice by one-half point in March the last after the March 17 budget presentation and analysts had been expecting another half point cut shortly afterwards

13053	A steep drop in goods-producing jobs detracted from US March non-farm payroll employment and makes it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy to defend the dollar economists said US March non-farm payroll employment rose 164000 less than the gain of 220000 to 290000 the financial markets expected Manufacturing employment fell 25000 compared with Februarys 50000 gain while March construction employment dropped 45000 after being unchanged in February The momentum of industrial activity is tapering off as we end the first quarter said Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc This sets the stage for more sluggish growth in the second and third quarters The Fed will view this as a caution flag on the economy he said They will not ease as long the dollar is weak but clearly they cant tighten David Wyss of Data Resources Inc said that the downward revision in February non-farm payroll employment to 236000 from 337000 means that employment gains in the first quarter were weaker than expected While Wyss left his first-quarter forecast of real US gross national product growth at 35 pct he said the March jobs data suggested a downward revision in his second-quarter growth forecast to 25 pct from 28 pct Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said the average monthly gain in non-farm jobs in the first quarter was only 237000 compared with 254000 in the fourth quarter of 1986 Theres momentum in first quarter labor force activity but less than assumed he said Gains in goods-producing jobs were subdued at best This rules out any possibilty of the Fed tightening for exchange-related purposes In March the average workweek fell back to its January level of 348 hours from 350 hours in February Manufacturing hours also fell back to their January level totalling 409 hours in March compared with 412 hours in February The Commerce Department noted that loss of manufacturing jobs in March was concentrated in automobile electrical and electronic manufacturing Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International said that a 13000 decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted for nearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs Economists said that a build-up in auto inventories resulting from a steep drop in sales has finally caught up with the labor force and may point to slower growth ahead Most expect an increase in inventories of as much as five pct to offset a steep four to five pct drop in final sales in the first-quarter GNP accounts Roach said he expects first quarter US GNP to rise two pct to be followed by a gain of 10-15 pct at best in the second and third quarters He said the March drop in industrial activity is a reasonable response in light of the inordinate contribution inventory accumulation made to GNP Economists said the employment data also suggest weak gains in industrial production and personal income for March They expect only marginal gains if not small declines for these indicators compared with a February increases of 05 pct in industrial production and 09 pct in personal income Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities said the drop in March construction employment may also signal a drop in March housing starts which rose 26 pct in February to 1851 million units at an annual rate from 1804 million units in January The rate of unemployment fell to 66 pct its lowest level since March 1980 from 67 pct in February But Wyss pointed out that this resulted from a drop in the labor force which fell to 1192 mln in March from 11935 mln in February This just means that there were fewer people looking for work so the drop in unemployment doesnt mean much he said He said the latest employment report will not concern the Fed because it does points to GNP growth in the first half of 25-30 pct but it does suggest they cant afford to tighten to quickly either The statistical factors used to smooth out seasonal fluctuations in the jobs data may have understated March labor force gains just as seasonal factors probably overstated them in January and February Slifer said but are consistent with his forecast of 18 pct first quarter GNP growth Economic growth remains sluggish but Silfer does not think that the Federal Open Market Committee changed policy at their meeting this week At some point they will be more inclined to ease he said For the time being however the March employment report increases the likelihood they wont tighten regardless of the dollar
13243	British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the next UK Election was not the only element standing in the way of full British membership of the European Monetary System EMS But he added that arguments against joining had weakened Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher widely believed to be the strongest government opponent of full EMS membership has made clear she does not expect to consider joining until after the next UK election due by mid-1988 at the latest But Lawson in answer to a question told reporters after an informal European Community finance ministers meeting here that other factors apart from the upcoming election stood in the way of full membership In addition to the question of the exchange rates at which Britain should enter the EMSs core exchange rate mechanism there was also the impact of sterling membership on the system to be considered he said British entry would change the EMS from a monopolar system based on the West German mark to a bipolar mark-sterling system he noted We have to make sure it would work But Lawson added that some of the considerations that had made it difficult for Britain to join in the past now posed less of a problem As an example he cited sterlings role as a petrocurrency which he said was diminishing That argument has clearly weakened he said Lawson restated that the government was keeping the question of membership under review

13903	Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said a further large drop in the value of the dollar could be counterproductive for world economic growth Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee Volcker said that Europe and Japan were slowing exports and that growth in those countries was also decreasing In that kind of situation further sizeable depreciation of the dollar could well be counterproductive he said Domestic expansion in foreign industrial countries has not been enough to offset the effects of slower exports Volcker said On the value of the dollar Volcker said he could not say whether it should be higher or lower to restore balance in trade What we do know is that a substantial exchange rate adjustment has already been made he said That adjustment should be large enough in a context of a growing world economy and fiscal restraint in the United States to support the widespread expectations of a narrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead he said Volcker said US exports were now growing substantially while import growth should slow Volcker said that to improve the trade deficit with a minimum of inflationary pressure the United States would have to slow its spending growth It would also have to achieve a better balance between investment and domestic savings if it wants to be able to dispense with foreign capital The constructive way to work in the needed direction would be to reduce our budget deficit year by year paving the way for improvements in our trade accounts he said Relying on depreciation of the dollar alone would risk renewed inflation he said

13949	Bundesbank council member Lothar Mueller said the bank has not given up its money supply policy and that restraining money supply growth does not always mean pushing up interest rates Mueller said in an article for the Boersen Zeitung financial daily that a monetary policy which took into account exchange rate expectations and capital flows could not be confused with an exchange rate oriented policy The article followed international press speculation that the Bundesbank had abandoned money supply targetting in favour of an exchange rate policy Mueller a member of the Bundesbank council in his position as president of the regional state central bank in Bavaria noted that the Bundesbanks decision in January to cut leading interest rates amid continuing strong monetary growth had led some people to think it was dropping monetary targetting Simply to ignore the external economic context would be risky and dangerous for monetary policy he explained Mueller said the cuts in official interest rates had put an end to interest rate speculation The Bundesbank could now assume that upward pressure on the mark would ease and currency inflows slow down Lower money market rates achieved by widening short and long term interest rate differentials also encouraged investors to re-invest funds parked in liquid accounts Mueller said The measures therefore aimed clearly at bringing monetary growth back onto the desired path he said Finally of course and there is no need to keep this quiet the cut in interest rates was also in line with the changed economic situation of the last few months he added All in all the Bundesbank in no way abandoned its money supply policy with the January discount rate cut despite suppositions to the contrary Mueller said Keeping money supply developments in check is not always synonymous with raising interest rates especially when excessive liquidity due to inflows from abroad rather than growth in bank credits is the cause of rising monetary holdings of non-banks Mueller said Now that West Germany no longer ran large external deficits other concepts were needed for monetary policy Mueller said it would be both difficult and dangerous for monetary policy to pursue a specific markdollar exchange rate In any case the exchange rate partly depends on US Currency and budgetary policy and the US Economy he said But an exchange rate orientation would also mean the end of a strict stability policy because both interest rates and liquidity would be affected by required currency intervention and could no longer be steered autonomously by the Bundesbank Even interest rates are not in the centre of the Bundesbanks considerations but reflect competition and other market conditions Mueller said A cut in bank liquidity will not directly influence central bank money stock the Bundesbanks main money supply indicator This does not reflect banking liquidity but the liquidity of industry and households which cannot be directly reached with the Bundesbanks instruments Mueller said The less dependent non-banks are on bank credits the harder it is to steer money supply This has increasingly been the case recently because non-banks have received considerable sums from current account surpluses and capital imports If the Bundesbank had tried to brake the money supply rise with higher interest rates as would have been appropriate if credit was growing excessively it would not only have missed its target but probably even set off further inflows he said Mueller said growth in money supply was still too high In the last three months money stock grew at an annual rate of seven pct down from 10 pct in the previous quarter The growth curve has therefore come closer to the three to six pct 1987 target corridor for central bank money stock growth pointing to the success of the current policy he said But high monetary stocks can be a warning sign and there should be no change in priorities Monetary policy must be first and foremost stability policy and successful stability policy is money supply policy -- nothing else he said

14767	News of an agreement among G-5 and G-7 finance ministers meeting in Washington this week will be key to the direction of currency futures at the International Monetary Market but any such agreement will need to go beyond the Paris accord to stem the recent rise in futures financial analysts said If they the finance ministers give the market something really new to look at -- that is some package that goes beyond the Paris agreement -- you could have a real boost in the dollar said Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Anne Mills On the other hand anything neutral would tend to be bearish for the dollar Mills said Traders and analysts agree a simple reaffirmation of the Paris accord will not be enough to halt the decline in the dollar nor will central bank intervention A lot of people are looking for a reason to buy currencies and sell the dollar said one trader for a large retail firm on the floor of the IMM If there is no concrete resolution they will be looking to sell the dollar possibly down to the 180 mark level he said Technically most currency futures are poised for another rise said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane Sloane noted that June yen futures set a new contract high on Tuesday and closed at its best level ever while June sterling set a new contract high on Monday Everything seems to be coming to a head right now and you dont need much to get things rolling Sloane said In particular the June Canadian dollar for which Sloane recently put out a buy recommendation has hovered in a range between 07600 and 07660 in recent weeks forming a triangle on the charts from which it may soon break out on the upside A close above the contract high of 07665 would signal a breakout Sloane said and would likely mean the nearby Canadian dollar contract would extend its advance to near the 07800 level June Canadian dollar closed at 07656 Tuesday Mills noted however that interest rate differentials between Canadian securities and US securities have narrowed dramatically recently with yields on 10-year Canadian bonds only about 80 basis points above US 10-year notes What has helped the Canadian currency she noted is an increasing proportion of foreign funds flowing into the Canadian equity market particularly from Japanese investors Other analysts however said currency futures may be near the top of their long-term rally Something will be done at the G-5 and G-7 meeting to calm people said David Horner of Merrill Lynch Economics The Paris accord has pretty much fixed where major European currencies will trade Horner said But sterling futures may still make another run for new highs up to 16300 to 16500 dlr in the June contract on the positive atmosphere that will prevail before British elections and possibly another interest rate cut Horner said The June British pound closed at 16080 on Tuesday Horner said that new boundaries for the trading range of the yen are likely to come out of the G-5 and G-7 meetings The most likely range will be a bottom for the dollar between 140 to 142 yen per dollar and a top near 150 to 152 yen Horner said In yen futures the bottom of the dollars range would be equivalent to 0007100 to 0007150 in the June contract June yen closed at 0006913 on Tuesday If such a range does emerge from the meetings we will have one more rally in the yen Horner said
14770	Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German economic growth In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs here Poehl said It would be an extremely risky policy to aim for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit He said the United States could face a vicious circle of depreciation inflation and more depreciation if it took that route Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet US Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy accelerating tax cuts cutting interest rates and tolerating above-target money supply growth He said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to the beginning of this year but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the West German parliament But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could accept on exports from a rising mark he said Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about one-third of its gross national product so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home A further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth he said Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade had given some extra leeway But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct not the reported negative inflation rates last year and West Germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments For the time being we will have to focus our policy more on the external side and we can live with a more expansionary money supply But we must be very careful he said He said he shared some of the US Concern about Japans trade surpluses which affected European countries as well as the United States Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries saying the importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level and that further changes would damage growth he said This was a remarkable change in attitude especially on the part of our American colleagues he said But he said there was still a danger that the correction of the dollars value could overshoot

2025	Responsibility for the appreciation of the Taiwan dollar and the South Korean Won lies soley with those countries said US trade representative Clayton Yeutter Speaking to the Asia Society Yeutter said that it is in those countries own long-term interest to raise the value of their currencies against the dollar Yeutter was responding to a question about what the US could do to encourage appreciation of those currencies against the dollar in order to reduce the large US trade deficits with Taiwain and Korea An undervalued currency will help those countries exports in the short term but in the long run they have to be concerned about how they are perceived in the international business community Yeutter said For Taiwan Yeutter said that with its per capita trade surplus with the US much larger than that of Japans and with huge foreign exchange reserves it was difficult to defend the high import tarrifs and other barriers that prevail in that country He also said that the south Korean Won should begin to move to reflect underlying economic fundamentals otherwise in two or three years time Korea will be in the same situation that prevails in Taiwan Turning to the US deficit with Japan of more than 50 billion dlrs Yeutter said that this situation was not sustainable Something must give soon If not there is a great threat of US legislative action to counteract that trend Yeutter said

2352	A reduction of the US federal budget deficit will be needed to help eliminate the nations huge trade deficit US trade representative Clayton Yeutter said Speaking to the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry Yeutter said Capital and trade flows are clearly inter-releated now Unless we get the budget deficit down we will not get the trade deficit down He did not elaborate on his views of the linkages between the two deficits Private analysts have said that the financing of large US budget deficits requires heavy capital inflows from overseas investors through purchases of US Treasury and to a lesser extent other US securities as well Well make some progress in reducing the 170 billion dlr trade deficit in 1987 but theres still a long way to go Yeutter said He said the problem must be approached on many fronts and focus most strongly on US and overseas fiscal and monetary policies to foster economic growth US competitiveness and the establishment of a level playing field for trade The US trade representative said the Federal Reserve under Chairman Paul Volcker has done its part to improve the trade situation by getting interest rates down On the fiscal side Yeutter said the budget deficit is still our biggest problem and there has not been enough progress toward reducing that deficit In the international area he said that our major trading partners could still do more to stimulate domestic growth Commenting on Japan which is running around a 80 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States Yeutter said Japan is just not doing the job on the import side Yeutter declined to comment on statements relating to the dollar made earlier today by Commerce Dept undersecretary of Economic Affairs Robert Ortner In a Washington address to an Export-Import Bank sponsored meeting Ortner said he believed the dollar at current levels was fairly priced against most European currencies but that the yen is 10 or 15 pct undervalued The market will determine the dollars proper value in the end Yeutter said However he added that if the US and other nations do not take the necessary steps to cut the US trade deficit the dollar will be the equalizer Yeutter said there is no quick fix to the trade problem and any resort to such tactics as protectionist trade legislation or trade restrictions poses real dangers He said theres relatively little that Congress can do to legislate a solution to the trade problem Protectionist legislation will only provoke retaliation by US trading partners Yeutter said There is no doubt in my mind about the willingness of our trading partners to retaliate against unfair trade legislation Yeutter said adding that policy flexibility is essential in solving international trade problems
2354	The highly visible drama involving the yens sharp rise against the US Dollar is obscuring the fact that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major European currencies thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions Japanese and European research officials said The officials looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the Group of Five G-5 industrial nations told Reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the Japan-US Trade axis into a Japan-European Community EC axis to the discomfort of Europe In many ways not least in terms of rare international cooperation the September 1985 New York Plaza pact between the US Japan West Germany Britain and France to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture in which the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance but not necessarily central significance the officials said The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took place the dollar was already on its way down The agreement simply helped it on its way Senior EC financial expert in Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely You have to look at the dollars peak compared with now and that was well before Plaza he said On February 25 1985 the dollar peaked against the yen at 26315 yen On September 20 the Friday before Plaza it was 242 Since then despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action the dollar trend has been down down down Yet the ECU is now around 1734 yen The historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story The European currencies are moving back up against the yen The close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing In 1986 Japanese imports and exports with the EC both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms five pct in yen This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus Last January Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of of sales to the US against about a third in recent years Trade with the US in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to Europe where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms which is what is important to them Suddenly instead of the US It is Europe that is laying the golden egg said de Hora The EC is worried EC business also had a remarkable year in Japanese sales but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base compared with total Japan-US Trade The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than US Firms a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance and which will cause problems This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries But therefore Japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge said Azusa Hayashi Director of the First International Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry If you want my objective view I dont expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance Last year we asked for moderation in exports and this year we may have to do so again he said

3267	USX Corp chairman David Roderick called for a lower value for the US dollar against other currencies to help speed a correction in the US trade deficit which last year reached 170 billion dlrs In remarks prepared for a speech before the Economic Club of Detroit Roderick said There should be total resolve that the dollar versus other major currencies as well as the currencies of other nations having a substantial trade surplus with us must continue to decline so that the correction in our trade deficit starts on the road to recovery Roderick said the US should be understanding of the economic pain our trading partners experience as a result of a falling dollar But he added As painful as the correction may be to our trading partners it is less painful than leaving the problem uncorrected because that would lead us into an inevitable lengthy and steep world recession Roderick said between February 1985 and December 1986 the dollar fell by more than 40 pct in real terms against major industrial currencies and by 30 to 35 pct against a broader group of currencies of nearly all developing nations At the end of 1986 he said the value of foreign assets in the US exceeded the value of US assets abroad by 240 billion dlrs compared to five years ago when the US had a surplus in assets of 141 billion A company spokesman said the data were provided by economic consultants to USX The primary reason for the trade imbalance was the 70 pct rise of the dollar between 1980 and 1985 although other factors were involved Roderick said But it is wrong he said to attribute the massive trade deficit to a fundmental deterioration of US productivity or of American product quality These areas need to be improved but they are not the root cause of the trade gap problem Roderick said He urged American manufacturers to become more competitive so they can compete in global markets In the speech the USX chairman also called for changes in securities laws to curb what he called abuses by corporate raiders and speculators Among his proposals which he presented to the Senate Banking Committee in testimony last week were a requirement that raiders give 24-hour notice for every one pct of stock they acquire in a company Roderick proposed that tender offers must be made for all cash to all stockholders on equal terms and that raiders be required to have financing in place before a tender is made Further raiders should be required to make an all-cash tender offer once they acquire 10 pct of a target companys stock he said And payment of greenmail or a preferential price by a target company to buy back a raiders stake should be prohibited under the revised laws Roderick said changes were necessary to curb abuses but that he did not want laws that would hurt the financial markets or discourage fair price to all takeovers

3593	National Bank of Hungary first vice-president Janos Fekete said he hoped a planned eight pct devaluation of the forint will spur exports and redress last years severe trade deficit with the West Fekete told Reuters in an interview Hungary must achieve at least equilibrium on its hard currency trade It is useful to have a devaluation he said There is now a real push to our exports and a bit of a curb to our imports The official news agency MTI said today Hungary would devalue by eight pct and it expected the new rates to be announced later today Fekete said the rates would come into effect tomorrow He said one reason for the devaluation was that Hungary had a higher rate of inflation over the past two years than its main partners around eight pct in 1985 and between five and 55 pct in 1986 This was partly an after-effect of action Hungary took to prevent inflation from soaring during the oil price shocks of the 1970s he added Hungary devalued by a similar amount last September and by between three and four pct early last year But the countrys hard currency trade balance nevertheless fell into a deficit of 5394 mln dlrs from a surplus of 2953 mln in 1986 and 12 billion in 1985 Fekete said Hungary was hoping for a hard currency trade surplus of between 200 and 300 mln dlrs this year but that a more likely outcome would be closer to equilibrium on total hard currency trade of around 10 billion dlrs One Western commercial attache here said Devaluation of itself will not change anything It will only be useful if they also make efforts to restructure industry and improve the quality of their export goods Fekete said he hoped to raise credits on good terms this year to invest in restructuring industry It would be his role to persuade international banks to cooperate in this process He noted Hungary had been given an AA rating enabling it to raise money on the Japanese Samurai bond market Hungarys net hard currency debt soared to 779 billion dlrs last year from 501 billion in 1985 partly because of a current account deficit of 142 billion dlrs and partly because the fall in the dollar increased the dollar value of debt denominated in marks or yen He said he feared net debt would also rise slightly this year but he was in favour of borrowing for the purpose of modernisation I am for credits to invest for that purpose he said I am against credits for consumption He forecast gross domestic product growth of two pct this year from one pct in 1986 Fekete said Hungary would continue to restructure its debt profile by prepaying high interest shorter and medium term loans with cheaper long term money for which it was looking more and more to the fixed interest rate bond market where he considered rates to be low Hard currency foreign exchange reserves would stay at around 35 billion dlrs he said On the budget deficit which tripled to a provisional 47 billion forints last year after quadrupling in 1985 Fekete said the finance ministry was working out measures to reduce an approved target deficit for this year of 438 billion forints to between 30 and 35 billion forints

4809	The European Monetary System marks its eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in Europe economists say But many economists say the system which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands remains in its infancy Its new currency the European Currency Unit Ecu has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar And on Wednesday the long term vision of the Ecu as Europes common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when Belgium minted the worlds first Ecu coin But economists say members such as West Germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the systems founding fathers ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French President Valery Giscard dEstaing Under this phase originally due to have started two years after the EMS was set up decision-making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous European Monetary Fund But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters The basic problem of the EMS is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common said one economist who has closely watched the systems development The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on third currencies accentuating what the economists say is the systems greatest weakness its vulnerability to a weak dollar Over the past 18 months as the US Dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies the resulting sharp rise of the West German mark severely strained the system MORE As the mark soared against the dollar it also rose against EMS currencies less favoured by international investors And as West Germany last year refused to give in pressure from several EC partners and the United States to cut interest rates to slow the marks rise the EMS had to be realigned twice to ease financial and trade strains within the community Two months ago the mark and the Dutch guilder were revalued by three pct and the Belgian and Luxembourg francs by two pct against other currencies in the system -- the French franc Italian lira the Irish punt and Danish crown Another frustration has been Britains failure to lend the EMS political support by keeping the pound still a major world currency outside the system No change in the British governments attitude is expected before the countrys next general elections due by mid-1988 Meanwhile the systems last realignment the 11th since it was set up prompted European finance ministers to ask the ECs highly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details They are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change Technical measures wont be enough to protect the EMS against external factors such as dollar weakness For that we must take the step forward to the institutional level said Leo de Corel of Kredietbanks economic research department Economists say the systems fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates If the dollar resumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence they predict

4882	US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said that whether the exchange rate of the dollar would fall or rise in the coming decade would depend on nations financial monetary and tax policies But he said in a speech and remarks to the Heritage Foundation that in the end the marketplace will ultimately rule the day Asked about the future of the dollar he said that whether or not it would rise or fall depended on economic policies and coooperation among trading nations Yeutter said if nations do the right kinds of things in financial monetary and tax policies then a lesser burden of adjustment is placed on exchange rates and one could envision a situation of the major trading nations moving back far closer to what most of us would consider equilibrium and exchange rates becoming relatively stable But he said on the other hand that if nations did not exhibit greater self discipline and international cooperation It is simply inevitable that the exchange rates will make that adjustment

market pushed the dollar sterling the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar higher But operators got their fingers burned as one by one the central banks signalled their displeasure So far G-6 has been a roaring successsaid James ONeill financial markets economist at Marine Midland Bank NA The central banks are sending strong signals that they wont tolerate any kind of momentum building behind currencies added a senior corporate trader at one UK bank On February 22 the finance ministers and central bank governors of the US Japan West Germany France and the UK -- the Group of Five -- plus Canada signed an accord under which they agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around prevailing levels The agreement was viewed by many in the market as an attempt to put a floor under the dollar after its sizeable two-year decline against major world currencies And initially traders indicated their respect for the accord by refraining from pushing the dollar lower But by Wednesday the dollar climbed to more than 187 marks about five pfennigs above its levels the Friday before the G-6 accord The move was aided by indications that the US economy picked up steam in February at the same time as the West German economy was regressing But dealers said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York gave traders a sharp reminder that the G-6 pact had encompassed the idea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines Dealers differed as to whether the US central bank actually intervened to sell dollars above 187 marks or simply telephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about trading conditions But the dollar quickly backed off It hovered today around 185 marks The market was surprised that the Fed showed its face so soon said Marine Midland NAs ONeill Also on Wednesday London dealers said the Bank of England intervened in the open market to sell sterling as the UK currency rose to 160 dlrs compared with 15355 dlrs before the G-6 pact Sterling along with the other high-yield currencies like the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar was in favor after traders surmised that the the chance of intervention pursuant to the Paris currency accord left limited room for profit plays on dollarmark and dollaryen The pound also was boosted by suggestions of an improving UK economy anticipation of a popular British budget on March 17

several months The dollar fell to 1523540 yen from 1533540 last night Analysts said the yen also gained as traders unwound long sterlingshort mark positions established lately Because of the change in perceptions about the health of the German economy the funds from those unwinding operations are ending up in yen a dealer at one UK bank said Recent West German data have shown falling industry orders lower industrial output and slowing employment gains Moreover the yen is benefitting as Japanese entities who have invested heavily overseas for example in Australian financial instruments repatriate their profits ahead of the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 Noting that the dollaryen rate is in a sense the most controversial one because of the large US trade deficit with

in January But the market has to bear in mind that time marches on and the situation changes said McGroarty of Discount

5201	German banking authorities are weighing rules for banks off-balance sheet activities in an attempt to cope with the growing volume of sophisticated capital market instruments banking sources said Interest rate and currency swaps and currency options are under closest scrutiny and if revisions are made they may resemble regulation jointly proposed by the US And UK To Japan Juergen Becker director of the Bundesbanks division of banking law and credit supervision said the US-British proposals were interesting but declined to elaborate But banking sources said West Germany was more likely to produce its own conclusions than to adopt foreign proposals There is no formal plan yet but talks are in the latter stages one representative of the German Banking Association in Cologne said Bankers expect rule changes this year All alterations must be approved by the Bundesbank West Germanys four major banking associations and the Federal Banking Supervisory Office Talks have been slowed by the fact that fundamental changes would require a revision of Germanys credit law which has been in effect since 1934 Authorities favour reinterpreting the credit law to fit present circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentary political process of changing it banking sources said Since the beginning of 1984 the banking law has limited banks lending to 18 times shareholders equity plus reserves on a consolidated basis But lending ratios do not extend to several newer instruments such as spot and forward currency contracts currency and interest swaps commercial paper programs currency options interest rate futures in foreign currencies and various innovative types of interest rate hedges The sources said the main value of the US-UK Proposals lay in differentiating between different types of risk factor and for instance in placing greater weight on currency swaps than interest swaps But even if German banking authorities agree with some of the assessments of swaps they disagree on how to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk US-British proposals include a complicated series of formulae for assessing the stream of payments involved in swaps whose ultimate risk is borne by the financial intermediary especially when counterparties remain anonymous This is the so-called market-to-market value But German authorities are likely to consider this much too complex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule of lending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness of the borrowers involved the sources said The weightings also likely if lending ratios are extended to include banks securities portfolios are zero for public authorities 20 pct for domestic banks 50 pct for foreign banks and 100 pct for other foreign and non-bank borrowers A further complication is that the more flexible definitions of equity allowed in the US And the UK May put German banks at a competitive disadvantage the sources said Stricter definitions here also mean the use of a version of the US-UK Proposals could far exceed the intent of the US And British authorities the sources said One specialist for Dresdner Bank AG said a long-dated foreign exchange forward transaction could for instance be brought under the same rule as a cross-currency swap despite the fact that the risk may be entirely different How new regulations will affect foreign banks here was uncertain Many have converted to full subsidiary status and applied for a full banking licence over the last two years in order to lead-manage mark eurobonds But as their equity capital is fairly small tight lending ratios will severely hamper foreign banks freedom of movement particularly in the growing business of currency swaps if they are required to include more transactions in the balance sheet the sources added

5394	The European Monetary System marks its eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in Europe economists say But many economists say the system which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands remains in its infancy Its new currency the European Currency Unit Ecu has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar And on Wednesday the long term vision of the Ecu as Europes common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when Belgium minted the worlds first Ecu coin But economists say members such as West Germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the systems founding fathers ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French President Valery Giscard dEstaing Under this phase originally due to have started two years after the EMS was set up decision-making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous European Monetary Fund But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters The basic problem of the EMS is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common said one economist who has closely watched the systems development The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on third currencies accentuating what the economists say is the systems greatest weakness its vulnerability to a weak dollar Over the past 18 months as the US Dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies the resulting sharp rise of the West German mark severely strained the system Another frustration has been Britains failure to lend the EMS political support by keeping the pound still a major world currency outside the system No change in the British governments attitude is expected before the countrys next general elections due by mid-1988 Meanwhile the systems last realignment the 11th since it was set up prompted European finance ministers to ask the ECs highly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details They are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change Technical measures wont be enough to protect the EMS against external factors such as dollar weakness For that we must take the step forward to the institutional level said Leo de Corel of Kredietbanks economic research department Economists say the systems fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates If the dollar resumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence they predict

6083	Zambia will reintroduce a modified foreign exchange auction at the end of this month as part of a new two-tier exchange rate central bank governor Leonard Chivuno said Chivuno told a press conference at the end of three weeks of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund IMF that there would be a fixed exchange rate for official transactions and a fluctuating rate decided by the auction for other types of business The Bank of Zambia previously held weekly auctions to distribute foreign exchange to the private sector and determine the kwachas exchange rate but these were suspended at the end of January President Kenneth Kaunda said at the time that he was suspending the auction system in view of the rapid devaluation and violent fluctations of the exchange rate which had resulted Business and banking sources said another reason for suspending the auction was that the central bank was low on foreign exchange and was 10 weeks behind in paying successful bidders    The kwacha stood at 22 per dollar when the auction system was first introduced in October 1985 but it slid to around 15 per dollar by the time it was suspended 16 months later Since then Zambia has operated a fixed exchange rate of about nine kwacha per dollar
6108	The dollar is near appropriate levels against European currencies and the yen and a further fall could damage confidence in the currency while endangering world economic growth a top Bundesbank official said Board member Leonhard Gleske also told a Forex Association conference current exchange rates of major currencies can be viewed as equilibrium levels in a medium-term perspective He said the recent Paris agreement on currency stabilisation and policy coordination between the Group of Five and Canada may herald an era of greater exchange rate stability The Paris agreement was not however an attempt to set up permanent target zones for exchange rates Gleske stressed adding such targets would be extremely difficult to agree and enforce on an international level At present levels the dollar can no longer be considered grossly overvalued in relation to the European currencies and the yen Gleske said He said the dollar had fallen much less against currencies of important trading nations such as Canada Korea Taiwan and Hong Kong and further falls there may still be necessary But a further dollar depreciation against major European currencies and the yen may not be the best way to restore the dollar to a fully competitive position as measured by its weighted external value he said In fact a further marked decline in the dollar rate would hold two major dangers Gleske said First in countries with large balance of payments surpluses such as Japan and West Germany it threatened to hamper economic growth and thus slow down the expansion of real income and domestic expenditure necessary to wipe out surpluses Second in the United States it could damage investors confidence in the dollar and thus reduce their willingness to finance huge fiscal and external payments deficits Gleske said Gleske also was strongly sceptical that an international system of binding target zones for currencies fluctuating in narrow bands against each other can be established Such targets threatened to cause policy conflicts both within countries and between them For instance the US Reliance on foreign capital to fund its deficits requires interest rates there be set at high levels but domestic considerations call for low ones If target zones were established this would put pressure on other countries to reduce their interest rates even more even though this may be in conflict with their own domestic situation and priorities he said Gleske added targeting the exchange rate even within a wide margin will meet with serious objections where there is a clearly perceived potential for conflict between domestic and external policy priorities Commenting on the Paris currency accord Gleske said its chances of stabilising exchange rates rested heavily on current interest rate differentials being maintained These chances seem to me to rest critically on the expectation that the current configuration of interest rates and the monetary policies behind them will assure smooth financing of current account imbalances in the months ahead Gleske said past experience of currency adjustments had learned that markets are inclined to be impatient and will thus tend to overshoot He said this would seem to be unnecessary and should be avoided if at all possible Monetary policies can help achieve this but only if markets believe that pledged changes in fiscal policies will lead to balanced international payments he said

6400	Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said he was content with the current level of sterling and welcomed todays announcement of a further half point cut in British bank base lending rates to 10 pct However he said he wanted to see a gradual approach to declines in domestic UK Interest rates although optimism in financial markets might push for big moves quickly He told a briefing of economic journalists that I dont think we should rush anything Lawson stressed the themes of gradualism and steadiness as economic policy Lawson acknowledged that todays fall in interest rates were in response to his budget for fiscal 198788 unveiled yesterday to Parliament and which set a lower target for the key Public Sector Borrowing Requirement PSBR of 10 pct of GDP Lawson said the two recent cuts in base rates both made this month in the form of half percentage point declines were perfectly consistent with monetary conditions now in Britain He supported that by saying the narrow M0 money supply aggregate was safely inside its flucuation band of two to six pct set for both 198687 and 198788 In his budget Lawson set no explicit target range for the broader sterling M3 Turning to the question of Britain eventually joining the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System EMS Lawson repeated that it is most unlikely we will enter before the next election He said Britain was keeping the subject of full EMS membership under constant review But he would not indicate what the chief considerations for this were for the government Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher late last year said a decision on whether or not to join depended on the strength of the UK Economy But she later said such a move depended on other EMS countries scrapping residual capital controls Although Lawson denounced what he said was the current wave of election fever in Britain he added  It is more likely that there will be an election this year than not He said he supported an early election only because it would clear the air Ideally we the government should have a full term but events could force a premature poll Lawson said The government which has been in power since 1979 must call an election by June 1988 Speculation is rising for either a June or an early autumn election political sources said The decision to cut basic tax by only two pence in 198788 was the right balance economically and politically he said Lawsons decision to restrict the fall in the standard rate of tax to two-pence surprised many analysts who had predicted that with Treasurys coffers full of tax revenue would have allowed the government to reach its goal of 25 pct in one move But it was being praised today by political analysts as a shrewd move which while advancing towards that aim could not be seized upon by opposition parties as overtly trying to bribe the electorate Lawson told journalists he had been surprised by how much the PSBR had undershot his original assumption of 71 billion stg for 198687 -- by some three billion stg Returning to changing levels of interest rates Lawson stressed that they are not an objective for the government -they are an instrument of policy Consequently the Treasury had no precise target for domestic borrowing levels he said But there may be interest rate consequences from changes in the level of government borrowing he added Lawson said he did not think that the UKs relatively high level of real interest rates had hurt investment in Britain He said conditions created by Londons role as a leading financial centre had caused sterling interest rates to be higher in real terms than in other countries Three factors had caused the higher level in relative interest rates in Britain Lawson said First control of credit in Britain rested on interest rates alone due to the freedom of its financial markets He said the second reason was political uncertainty caused by proposed spending plans of the opposition Labour Party Thirdly he said we do not have as long a track record of low inflation as did the US Japan and West Germany Lawson foresaw London becoming the worlds pre-eminent financial centre because it was more international in character and more favourably placed in time zones than New York or Tokyo
6426	The Bundesbank is likely to steer a steady monetary course over the next few weeks and a change in credit policies is not expected at tomorrows regular central bank council meeting bank economists and dealers said There is no need for action Hermann Remsperger chief economist of Berliner Handels- and Frankfurter Bank BHF said Others noted that exchange rates are stable after last months Group of Six agreement in Paris and central bank money stock growth is still well above the three to six pct target zone so a change in credit policies could be ruled out One money market dealer said comments by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl at a private seminar in Duesseldorf two weeks ago hinting at another interest rate cut only indicated the Bundesbank might act if conditions changed Bank economists said US Pressure on West Germany to further ease credit policies had receded since the Paris pact But such demands could re-emerge if West Germany failed to stimulate its economy enough to affect the massive US Trade deficit Remsperger said continued strong money supply growth also precluded a further cut in official interest rates Central bank money stock was growing at an annualized 75 pct in February unchanged from the 75 pct in January Economists said some of the 18 members of the central bank council were worried about the continued overshoot in the money supply target and were bound to resist any moves to cut rates But Poehl played down the risk of inflation Economists said the fact that money stock growth remained stable last month was a success Some said it was likely to return to within the target range later this year The special factors which boosted money supply growth last year are disappearing one economist said He said some 75 pct of the money supply increase in 1986 was caused by a sharp rise in the inflow of foreign funds This trend had been reversed recently and with domestic credit demand likely to remain at steady levels money stock growth was expected to narrow in the medium-term These developments were increasing the Bundesbanks scope for a rate cut in the medium-term economists said Money market dealers said period rates remained little changed indicating no change in credit policy was expected Call money rates declined to 37580 pct from 39095 yesterday with the market well stocked with liquidity Dealers said call money was soft because tax payments on behalf of customers had been less than expected so far But rates were likely to tighten again as soon as the full effect of this months major tax payment period is felt Payments for the federal railways bond are also likely to burden the market The Bundesbank did not inject liquidity via a securities repurchase agreement this week but countered a tightening in rates on Monday by injecting funds through government-owned banks Dealers said recent securities repurchase pacts had shown the Bundesbank clearly wanted call money rates stable at 380 One dealer said If the central bank wanted lower interest rates it would first of all drive call money rates down Banks remained relatively well stocked with minimum reserve assets They held 529 billion marks in minimum reserves on Monday averaging 537 billion marks over the first 16 days of March A requirement of around 51 billion is expected

6531	Todays modest half-point cut in UK Bank base lending rates to 10 pct signals the Bank of Englands determination to maintain a cautious monetary stance but financial markets appear set to force its hand analysts said They said a further half-point cut in base rates to 9-12 pct was bound to occur within the next week and rates may shed a further half point soon if markets remain buoyant Earlier markets were bracing for a one-point cut in rates after yesterdays budget set a sharp three billion stg reduction in 1987 government borrowing targets to four billion stg Sterling money market rates moved lower again with the key three-month interbank rate down to 9-58 12 pct at the start of business from 9-1116 916 yesterday and sterling rallied to four-year highs against the dollar in very active trading Government bond prices also surged on the budget with gains in excess of one point pushing yields on long-term paper below nine pct for the first time in nearly a year But todays smaller than expected rate cut appeared to have placated markets for now analysts said Money market rates recovered up to 14 point from earlier lows while both sterling and gilts came off highs as trading ground to a near halt Analysts said the slowdown was likely to be temporary and the reappraisal of sterling assets by international investors was set to resume as early as tomorrow leading to higher gilt prices exchange rate advances and lower money market rates Todays cut was slightly disappointing said Bill Martin chief UK Economist at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew The Bank of England is taking a very cautious line  To temper the markets first rush of blood to the head after the budget Analysts said the banks move today to lend two-week cash to UK Discount houses at a lower 10 pct suggested it hoped to maintain the new rates for about that period of time The analysts agreed success would depend largely on how sterling performs in the near term Sharp rises in the pounds value could be checked initially through Bank of England intervention but eventually the gains would force the bank to cut interest rates rates again The market seems to have accepted the modest cut for the time being said Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds But I am sceptical that the bank will be able to hold up rates for long Simmonds said he saw sterling rising another two US Cents this week from around 160 dlrs forcing a rate cut by Friday Robin Marshall chief economist at Chase Manhattan Securities said There is another half point to come in the near term this week or next week at the latestWe see a whole point off base rates in the next two or three weeks Analysts stressed that apart from prestige Britain had very little to gain from a sharp rise in sterlings exchange rate Martin of Phillips and Drew said the dampening effect of a sterling rise on consumer price inflation would not materialise for at least nine months while its hampering impact on manufactured exports would show almost immediately Analysts said the budget featuring income tax cuts as well as cautious plans for public finances had improved the chances of re-election for the Conservative government and probably advanced the election date One must be held before June 1988 Combined with overall good prospects for the UK Economy this was likely to fuel a foreign rush on sterling-denominated assets pushing the pounds value well above unofficial targets With mark-denominated investments largely out of favour because of low yields and a dull economic outlook Chases Marshall said Sterling is simply the best game in town especially after the budget and demand will remain strong

7043	The financial rand widely viewed as a direct reflection of foreign investor confidence in South Africa appears headed above 30 US Cents dealers and bank economists said The currency has risen about 25 pct in the past three months to its current rate of 2950 cents due partly to signs of a possible power shift with the appearance of a number of independent candidates in the whites-only election on May 6 they added It has risen about two cents this week alone Another factor is that banks in London where the main market is based are going long in the currency because of a general feeling that it will rise in the future one economist said Dealers described 30 cents as a psychological barrier that was expected to be broken soon after a brief consolidation phase from recent gains After reaching 30 cents There is a chance of appreciation to 32 cents in the next several weeks one dealer said There was a widespread feeling that both the commercial rand holding stable at 48 cents and the financial rand were staying firm banking sources said A Barclays National Bank executive who asked not to be identified said The rise of the independents appears to be indicative of a potential shift of power in the National Party and has created a favourable sentiment overseas One dealer said growing business and investor interest from West Germany and Switzerland were behind the financial rands rise Economists said foreigners also were being attracted by South Africas long-term government bonds and semi-gilts or securities in partly government-owned firms many with yields as high as 30 pct They could be purchased with financial rands with interest paid in commercial rands This has had a definite influence on the financial form of the rand a dealer said adding that at present demand is slightly in excess of supply The financial rand was reintroduced in September 1985 to help end capital flight from South Africa during a period of severe political unrest in the country

7313	Slower than expected growth in Britains narrow M0 money supply measure in February will help spur a further cut in UK Interest rates if a surge in sterlings value requires such a move economic analysts said M0 the only targeted money supply measure left after Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson scrapped the official target for the broad sterling M3 measure in his 1987 budget speech on Tuesday fell an adjusted 34 to one pct in February On an annual basis this put M0 growth at four to 4-12 pct in the middle of the 1987 target of two to six pct The M0 data are much better than we expected said Robert Thomas economist at Greenwell Montagu Securities He and other analysts said while the better than expected M0 figures alone would not be sufficient to trigger a new interest rate cut they removed an obstacle to such a move Thomas noted the rise in M0 had been kept in check despite buoyant retail sales in February advancing an adjusted 22 pct after a fall of the same size in January Analysts said the M0 measure reflecting variations in consumer demand rather than real inflation prospects was not an adequate indicator to determine interest rates The authorities still seem to want to pretend that M0 is important  In practice it is likely to be the exchange rate and the election which call the tune Lloyds Merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle wrote in a budget comment Richard Jeffrey economist at stockbrokers Hoare Govett said in a comment It is unlikely that Lawson will respond to signals from M0 alone  Reinforcement from exchange rate trends is necessary before action is taken With the Chancellor making clear that policy manoeuvres are made in response to signals from this narrow money variable the City has been forced to take it seriously he added Noting this point Thomas said market fears at the end of last year of an M0 overshoot had now disappeared This removed a potential obstacle to a further cut in UK Base lending rates if foreign demand for sterling pushed up the pound above unofficial targets analysts said Such targets are believed to have been secretly agreed between finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada at their Paris meeting last month they added UK Base rates have been cut twice by half a point since the Paris agreement once on March 11 and again yesterday when foreign demand for sterling surged in reaction to a sharp cut in 1987 government borrowing targets contained in the budget They stand at 10 pct now and foreign exchange dealers and analysts expect them to shed another half-point in the coming week Analysts shrugged off as largely irrelevant a higher than expected increase in February sterling M3 which pushed the annual growth rate to almost 19 pct well above the previous target of 11 to 15 pct Thomas said the February figures seemed to indicate the improvement in sterling M3 growth witnessed over the past few months had been reversed but firm conclusions could only be drawn after revised data are released on March 31 Some analysts said foreign investors had long ceased to watch the sterling M3 target and Lawsons move to scrap it altogether earlier this week removed whatever was left of its credibility as a key factor in monetary policy

8845	Robert Heller a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System said commodity prices could form a useful guide for setting domestic and international monetary policy Speaking to the conservative Heritage Foundation Heller said A broadly based commodity price index may be worth exploring as a guide to monetary policy In times of rising commodity prices monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices monetary policy might be eased he said Commodities are also standardized to avoid measurement problems and occur at the beginning of production so as to give early warning signs of wholesale and retail changes There is no need to react to every small fluctuation in commodity prices or to do so on a daily basis Heller said in a prepared text But if commodity prices exhibit a broad trend a policy action might be considered he said Heller said using a broad-based commodity price index as an indicator for monetary policy would also contribute to stabilized currency exchange rates Commodity prices are generally uniform worldwide and prices for them are more consistent than for other types of goods he said He said other beneficial effects would be to stabilize export commodity prices for developing countries by using a commodity basket as a guidepost for monetary policy
8884	The move by foreign exchange markets to test the strength of the Paris currency accord has thrown into question the near-term outlook for sterling until recently one of the main beneficiaries of the agreement analysts said Since the six-nation accord last month sterling has risen sharply adding almost five pct on its trade-weighted index While the accord effectively stifled dollaryen and dollarmark movements the markets turned their attention to sterling as foreign investors rushed to take advantage of relatively high UK Interest rates But analysts say the pound has been sidelined by the first tentative test of the Paris accord seen yesterday The market now looks set sooner or later to push the dollar down further in a test of the willingness of central banks to intervene Analysts say if the banks do not intervene effectively the Paris accord could collapse On balance sterling would be a net sufferer if G-6 collapses Phillips and Drew analyst Stephen Lewis said He said sterling would lose out as markets turned their attention to capital movements whereas previously they had been restricted to looking only at the interest yield on currencies However although most analysts and foreign exchange dealers were forecasting a brief period of consolidation or even retracement for sterling none were expecting a very sharp drop in the UK Currency Sterling remained supported by optimism on the UK Political and economic outlook firmer oil prices and relatively high interest rates they said Bullish sentiment on the UK Economic outlook has been running especially high after last weeks budget seen as popular both with the markets and with British voters Sterling was also supported by signs of a weakening in the West German and Japanese economies where growth for 1987 is trailing behind the three pct forecast for the UK Recent opinion polls showing Britains ruling conservative party ahead of opposition parties in popularity have also supported the pound In addition sterling has so far shrugged off two half-point cuts in UK Bank base lending rates in less than two weeks A further half-point cut widely expected in the next week or so has already been largely discounted UK Base rates now running at 10 pct are still relatively high compared to other western countries and analysts said a further base rate cut to 9-12 pct was unlikely to affect sterling Sterling today appeared resilient to the dollars decline dropping only slightly on a cross-rate basis Worries about renewed turbulence in the foreign exchange markets however were reflected in the UK Government bond gilt market where prices dropped by up to 516 point Until now foreign investor interest in the gilt market has been one of the major reasons behind the rise in sterling Dealers said they expected the pound to hold quietly steady for the next few days while the market awaits further developments on the dollar and this Thursdays UK Current account figures for February Market forecasts are for a deficit of around 250 mln stg after Januarys small surplus

9007	Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said he supported efforts to persuade newly-industrialized countries NICS to revalue currencies that are tied to the dollar in order to help the United States cut its massive trade deficit We do need to do something with those currencies or we will be substituting Japanese products for Taiwanese products or those of other nations with currencies tied to the dollar Baldrige told a House banking subcommittee The US dollar has declined in value against the Yen and European currencies but has changed very little against the currencies of some developing countries such as South Korea and Taiwan because they are linked to the value of the dollar As a result efforts to reduce the value of the dollar over the past year and a half have done little to improve the trade deficits with those countries Baldrige told a House Banking subcommittee that the Treasury Department was attempting to persuade those countries to reach agreement with the United States on exchange rates
9022	Central bank intervention in the foreign exchange markets succeeded in staunching the dollars losses today but senior dealers here believe the US currency is headed for a further retreat Although the intervention was widespread dealers perceive that the six major industrial nations have differing levels of commitment to their recent accord to stabilize currencies Moreover hard economic realities hold greater sway over the currency market than central bank intervention and these argue for a further dollar decline dealers said The market can be bigger than the central banks And economic fundamentals will always come to the fore said a dealer at one major US bank As the dollar dropped to post-World War II lows against the yen today foreign exchange traders said the Bank of Japan Federal Reserve Board and Bank of England intervened in the markets on behalf of the US currency Reports of the authorities actions helped the dollar recover to about 14945 yen in New York this afternoon from the post-war low of 14820 yen in the Far East But it still failed to regain Mondays US closing level of 1500005 yen Tokyo dealers said the Bank of Japan bought one to 15 billion dlrs in Tokyo today and may also have purchased dollars yesterday in the US via the Federal Reserve Meanwhile there were strong rumors in New York that the Fed also bought a modest amount of dollars around 14850 yen today Talk also circulated that the Bank of England purchased a small amount of dollars for yen The Feds last confirmed intervention was on January 28 when it bought 50 mln dlrs in coordination with the Bank of Japan But on March 11 the Fed also was rumored to have signalled displeasure with a dollar surge above 187 marks The authorities actions appeared to back up the February 22 Paris pact between the US Japan West Germany Britain France and Canada under which the nations agreed to cooperate to foster exchange rate stability around prevailing levels But foreign exchange dealers were not overly impressed by the authorities intervention which they said can only soften extreme moves in the market For one thing some dealers believed that the Feds purchases were done on behalf of the Bank of Japan rather than for the US central banks own account suggesting a rather watered-down American commitment to the currency accord The Bank of Englands action also was thought to be completed on behalf of the Japanese central bank reinforcing the markets view that Japan is the most resolute of the six nations in its support of the currency pact No-one doubts the Bank of Japan is serious But the other two central banks seem to be making more token gestures than anything else said Chris Bourdain of BankAmerica Corp Im not convinced the intervention was concerted said Earl Johnson of Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago Its a yen problem more than anything else Some dealers said a rising wave of trade protectionist sentiment in the US limits the extent to which the American authorities can endorse a stronger dollar against the yen The dollars break below the key 150 yen level ties the Treasurys hands behind its back The US cannot intervene on its own account because of the strength of protectionism here said Albert Soria of Swiss Bank Corp Such comments reflect the view that the currency markets are becoming increasingly politicized Despite official denials some traders still feel the US would countenance a lower dollar to help trim the nations trade deficit The majority of the 170 billion dlr merchandise trade deficit in 1986 was with Japan Indeed US Treasury secretary James Bakers comment on Sunday that the February currency pact had not established dollar targets was read by the market as a signal to sell the US currency and kicked off the latest retreat The dollar still has more room on the downside against the yen based on the frictions in trade and financial services The currency market is becoming very political said Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank Ltd Okada expects the dollar to trade between 148 and 150 yen this week but sees the chance of a drop to 140 yen by the end of April or early May Even if West Germany and Japan succeed in stimulating their economies it may not be enough to solve structural economic imbalances in the near future dealers said Even if Japan and West Germany do expand this year it wont be enough to help the trade situation much said Bourdain of BankAmerica who also expects the dollar to drop to 148 yen in the next couple of days
9055	The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board Paul Volcker has written to the chairman of the House Banking Committee to raise concerns about legislative proposals scheduled for consideration Wednesday Volcker told committee chairman Fernand St Germain a proposal to deny primary dealer status to firms from countries that do not grant US firms equal access to their government debt markets might invite retaliation against US firms abroad He added even Japan against whom this proposal seems to be particularly directed has started opening its markets In his letter made available at the Treasury Volcker also said a proposal to ease debt problems of developing countries by setting up a public facility to buy their debts owed to commercial banks was a problem I believe that the prospect of debt relief would undermine the difficult internal efforts of the borrowing countries to achieve the structural reform that is needed regardless of the policies that are followed on servicing external debt Volcker said It might also cause private lenders to become reluctant to extend more credit to the borrowing countries he said Volcker said he endorsed comments by Treasury Secretary James Baker about the inappropriateness of using public resources for purchasing private commercial bank debt which we both see as an inherent aspect of the proposed international debt facility He also said a proposal for establishing formal procedures for international negotiations on currency exchange rates is unrealistic and could well have damaging effects For example the bills directive to intitiate negotiations in order to achieve a competitive exchange rate for the dollar -- a matter upon which there can be considerable difference among analysts -- runs the risk of building up potentially destabilizing market expectations Volcker said He recommended we should not lock ourselves into formalized procedures for international negotiations on exchange rates but instead use other more flexible means like the recent mmeting in Paris between US treasury and central bank representatives and those of major trade allies

9975	The Bundesbanks options for West Germany monetary policy are limited for the foreseeable future by the delicate stage of wage negotiations between unions and employers economists and money market dealers said Call money fell in quite active trading today dropping to 34050 pct from 35565 pct yesterday and below the 350 pct treasury bill rate as a difficult month-end approached But dealers and economists said the Bundesbank was unlikely to encourage lower rates in the foreseeable future largely for fear of upsetting the current wage round One money market dealer for a major foreign bank said I dont think the Bundesbank wants rates to go up whatever happens But it also does not want them to fall Above all it wants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes In West Germany unions and employers prepare the ground for triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessments of growth and inflation economists said Ute Geipel economist with Citibank AG said if the Bundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy raising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in the medium term unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands As a result the Bundesbank was concerned to make no move that would interfere in the negotiating process Geipel said In the current round the countrys most powerful union the IG Metall representing metalworkers and engineers is demanding a shortening of the working week to 35 hours from the present 38-12 and an accompanying five pct increase in wages The engineering employers association Gesamtmetall is offering to bring in a 38-hour-week from July 1 1988 and give a two stage wage increase -- a 27 pct rise from April 1 this year and another 15 pct from July 1 1988 The agreement forged by IG Metall -- Europes largest union with 25 mln members -- and the employers would set the benchmark for settlements in other industries such as the public sector banks and federal post office Negotiations began in December and unions are hopeful they may conclude by early April ahead of the traditional holiday period in June Though many economists said the unions current warning strikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy and would not lead to a repeat of 1984s damaging seven-week strikes others said unions would not compromise greatly on their positions and there could still be conflict This could extend the length of time in which the Bundesbank would keep its activity low-key economists said The money market head said the unions humiliation by the protracted financial problems of the Neue Heimat cooperative housing venture would contribute to union obstinacy The unions havent forgotten that and they will put this squarely onto the account in the negotiations he said In addition the newly-elected chairman of the IG Metall union Franz Steinkuehler was more radical and determined than his predecessor Hans Meyer and may be set for a longer battle to achieve the best possible settlement for his membership More than 16000 engineering workers at 45 firms mainly in south Germany held warning strikes lasting up to two hours yesterday Firms hit included Zahnradfabrik Passau GmbH and aerospace group Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH Today 28000 employees from 110 companies came out in warning strikes a statement from IG Metall said Money market dealers said that overnight call money rates would rise in the near future in any case and did not depend on a politically-inhibited Bundesbank About eight billion marks were coming into the market tomorrow from salary payments by the federal government As a result some banks fell back on the Bundesbanks offer to mop up liquidity via the sale of three-day treasury bills anticipating still lower rates before the month-end But a pension payment date by banks on behalf of customers was due on Monday other dealers noted If banks were short of liquidity until the bills matured on Tuesday rates could soar perhaps to the 550 pct Lombard ceiling Banks were well stocked up with funds having an average 521 billion marks in Bundesbank minimum reserves in the first 24 days of March well above the 507 billion requirement
