8041	Higher crude oil prices will raise demand for natural gas helping it to reclaim market share lost to heavy oil when prices plunged in 1986 analysts said The analysts said that these efforts will be most successful in the industrial sectors of the economy with large and growing energy requirements Natural gas stands a good chance to recapture the share of oil supplied to electric utilities that it lost to the residual fuel industry last year Michael Smolinski an energy economist with Data Resources Inc told Reuters An estimated 200000 barrels per day of residual fuel went into the utilities market at the expense of natural gas last year when world oil prices plunged Smolinski said Assuming oil prices hold above 15 dlrs a barrel national average gas prices delivered to the utilities at a projected 210 to 225 dlrs per mln Btu would be very competitive Michael German vice president of economic analysis at American Gas Association said The average delivered prices at the end of January were 210 dlrs per mln Btu compared with 326 dlrs a year ago We expect natural gas to regain 250 to 400 billion cubic feet of demand in the overall energy market in the second and third quarter 1987 he said In addition to price competitiveness availability will be an important factor persuading energy users to switch to gas Frank Spadine senior energy economist with Bankers Trust Corp in New York noted Spadine said the mild winter in many parts of the North American continent has led to a build up of gas inventories and less would be necessary to replenish underground storage this spring freeing gas for spot sales These forecasts develop a strong counterpoint to the fears that natural gas suplies would be tight and prices significantly higher given a sharp decline in drilling last year AGAs German contended that despite the drilling decline much of US proved reserves could be brought to production quickly through developments such as the infill drilling which permits more wells to be drilled in proved reserve basins Citing recent EIA statistics German said the gas surplus was likely to contract from three trillion cubic feet in 1986 to two trillion cubic feet in 1987 but the surplus would not go away until 1990 Smolinski of Data Resources agreed that the surplus would persist until 1990 While gas supplies may tighten in certain consuming areas notably in California and in the Northeast US an overall shortfall appeared remote
