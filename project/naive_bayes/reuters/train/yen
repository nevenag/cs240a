11203	Todays liberalised financial markets are making it extremely difficult for Japans monetary authorities to prevent the yens rise against the dollar but they have several options other than normal intervention Bank of Japan sources said A senior central bank official said that such methods as controlling foreign exchange deals and invoking currency swap agreements with other central banks which have not been invoked since 1978 are all being considered But the time may not be ripe he said In this era of financial liberalisation its almost impossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan said another senior bank official But the first official said From a technical viewpoint the Bank of Japan could activate swap agreements immediately after other central banks involved agreed to do so A swap agreement an exchange of currency between two nations allows both sides to acquire a ready source of the others currency in case of need If the Bank invokes such swaps both parties would announce the decision jointly said the first official The sources said they believed the limit of currency market intervention may be being reached after they saw recent concerted market action by central banks of major industrial nations was increasingly ineffective in propping up the battered dollar But intervention is at least an option they said Further easing of monetary policy will be very difficult with an official discount rate already at a record low of 25 pct they said Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita has repeatedly ruled out another rate cut due to fears it could revive inflation One bank official said he could not deny the possibilty of the Bank of Japan activating currency swap agreements with the US And other central banks if these banks continue intervening to sell the yen in support of the dollar and run out of their yen cash positions But we dont think they have become short of yen quite yet he said The bank has established a five billion dlr swap limit with the US Federal Reserve and another 25 billion mark and 200 billion yen limit with the West German and Swiss central banks according to the sources Foreign exchange dealers estimate the Fed had sold two billion dlrs worth of yen from its own account to support the dollar in New York last week The central bank sources also said Japan may arrange other currency swap agreements with Britain and France if they find it necessary but added they are not actually talking with each other towards that end

14767	News of an agreement among G-5 and G-7 finance ministers meeting in Washington this week will be key to the direction of currency futures at the International Monetary Market but any such agreement will need to go beyond the Paris accord to stem the recent rise in futures financial analysts said If they the finance ministers give the market something really new to look at -- that is some package that goes beyond the Paris agreement -- you could have a real boost in the dollar said Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Anne Mills On the other hand anything neutral would tend to be bearish for the dollar Mills said Traders and analysts agree a simple reaffirmation of the Paris accord will not be enough to halt the decline in the dollar nor will central bank intervention A lot of people are looking for a reason to buy currencies and sell the dollar said one trader for a large retail firm on the floor of the IMM If there is no concrete resolution they will be looking to sell the dollar possibly down to the 180 mark level he said Technically most currency futures are poised for another rise said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane Sloane noted that June yen futures set a new contract high on Tuesday and closed at its best level ever while June sterling set a new contract high on Monday Everything seems to be coming to a head right now and you dont need much to get things rolling Sloane said In particular the June Canadian dollar for which Sloane recently put out a buy recommendation has hovered in a range between 07600 and 07660 in recent weeks forming a triangle on the charts from which it may soon break out on the upside A close above the contract high of 07665 would signal a breakout Sloane said and would likely mean the nearby Canadian dollar contract would extend its advance to near the 07800 level June Canadian dollar closed at 07656 Tuesday Mills noted however that interest rate differentials between Canadian securities and US securities have narrowed dramatically recently with yields on 10-year Canadian bonds only about 80 basis points above US 10-year notes What has helped the Canadian currency she noted is an increasing proportion of foreign funds flowing into the Canadian equity market particularly from Japanese investors Other analysts however said currency futures may be near the top of their long-term rally Something will be done at the G-5 and G-7 meeting to calm people said David Horner of Merrill Lynch Economics The Paris accord has pretty much fixed where major European currencies will trade Horner said But sterling futures may still make another run for new highs up to 16300 to 16500 dlr in the June contract on the positive atmosphere that will prevail before British elections and possibly another interest rate cut Horner said The June British pound closed at 16080 on Tuesday Horner said that new boundaries for the trading range of the yen are likely to come out of the G-5 and G-7 meetings The most likely range will be a bottom for the dollar between 140 to 142 yen per dollar and a top near 150 to 152 yen Horner said In yen futures the bottom of the dollars range would be equivalent to 0007100 to 0007150 in the June contract June yen closed at 0006913 on Tuesday If such a range does emerge from the meetings we will have one more rally in the yen Horner said
