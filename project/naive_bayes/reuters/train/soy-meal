200	The sharp decline in soybean crush ratios seen in the last few weeks accelerating in recent days has pushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean processing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean meal and oil The weekly US soybean crush rate was reported by the National Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 2178 mln bushels down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over the past two months when crush margins surged to the best levels seen in over a year Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed soybean futures and premiums higher prompting a pick-up in the weekly crush number However much of that export demand seems to have been met with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge in shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next few months US processors are now finding domestic livestock feed demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder than normal winter so they steadily dropped offering prices in an attempt to find buying interest soyproduct dealers said Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent weeks setting a new contract low of 13970 dlrs per ton in the nearby March contract today Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold May looking for no deliveries on first notice day tomorrow which would cause March to gain on deferreds one CBT crush trader said But theyve been bailing out this week because the March has been acting like there will be a lot delivered if not tomorrow then later in the month he added As a result of the weakness in soymeal the March crush ratio The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 226 cents per bushel today dropping over five cents in just the last two days The May crush ended today just over 17 cents so no processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable level the trader said Hopefully they will now start to cut back production to get supplies in line with demand he added With futures down processors are finding they must bid premiums for cash soybeans further reducing crush margins A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices down sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below the average cost of production cash dealers said Most soybean processing plants are still in operation with little talk of taking temporary down-time so far But processors will start halting production in the next few weeks it they continue to face unprofitable margins they added
235	Indonesias agriculture sector will grow by just 10 pct in calendar 1987 against an estimated 24 pct in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or declines the US Embassy said in a report Production of Indonesias staple food rice is forecast to fall to around 263 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 2658 mln tonnes in 1986 according to the annual report on Indonesias agricultural performance The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 267 mln tonnes with a forecast 273 mln tonnes output in 1987 The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 15 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 169 mln tonnes in 1986 because of a drawdown on stocks Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane rubber and copra show little or no gain the report says The modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans palm oil and palm kernels Constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds limited fertile land insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops the report underlines The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as wereng or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties and to use lower-yielding more resistant rice types The government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee tea rubber plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 70 pct in 1987 to 145 mln tonnes from 135 mln with exports rising to an estimated 720000 tonnes from 695000 tonnes in 1986 the report says But while production of soybeans in 198788 Oct-Sept will rise to 1075 mln tonnes from 980000 in 198687 imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant The report says that imports of wheat soybeans soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last Septembers 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand The report said that Indonesias overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s It compares with 19 pct growth in 1985 and 67 pct in 1984 The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump
303	Soybean imports are forecast to rise to 425000 tonnes in 198788 OctoberSeptember from an estimated 300000 in 198687 and 375000 in 198586 the US Embassy said in its annual report on Indonesias agriculture It said Indonesia did not achieve its goal of self-sufficiency in soybean output in calendar 1986 because it did not meet a planned increase in area planted and because yields have remained below target Soybean meal imports are forecast to fall to around 190000 tonnes in 198788 from 270000 tonnes in 198687 and 295000 tonnes in 198586 Domestic soybean production is forecast to rise steadily to 108 mln tonnes in 198788 from 980000 in the current year and 890000 in 198586 the report said Imports are forecast to fall in the current year but to rise in 198788 because of a new soybean crushing plant due to come on stream in early 1988 China is the main supplier with a 79 pct share while the US Provides the rest it said This pattern will likely continue during 198687 since domestic soyfood processors prefer Chinese beans and are willing to pay a premium for them it said Area planted is expected to increase by 10 pct in both 198687 and 198788 Yield increases continue to be hampered by an insufficient supply of quality seeds along with pest and disease problems the report said
