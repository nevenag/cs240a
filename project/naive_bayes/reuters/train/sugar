235	Indonesias agriculture sector will grow by just 10 pct in calendar 1987 against an estimated 24 pct in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or declines the US Embassy said in a report Production of Indonesias staple food rice is forecast to fall to around 263 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 2658 mln tonnes in 1986 according to the annual report on Indonesias agricultural performance The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 267 mln tonnes with a forecast 273 mln tonnes output in 1987 The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 15 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 169 mln tonnes in 1986 because of a drawdown on stocks Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane rubber and copra show little or no gain the report says The modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans palm oil and palm kernels Constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds limited fertile land insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops the report underlines The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as wereng or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties and to use lower-yielding more resistant rice types The government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee tea rubber plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 70 pct in 1987 to 145 mln tonnes from 135 mln with exports rising to an estimated 720000 tonnes from 695000 tonnes in 1986 the report says But while production of soybeans in 198788 Oct-Sept will rise to 1075 mln tonnes from 980000 in 198687 imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant The report says that imports of wheat soybeans soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last Septembers 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand The report said that Indonesias overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s It compares with 19 pct growth in 1985 and 67 pct in 1984 The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump
259	Indonesias raw sugar output is likely to be 18 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 unchanged from 1986 and below the governments 1987 forecast of 25 mln the US Embassy said in its agricultural outlook for 1987 Indonesia bought 162500 tonnes of raw sugar on world markets in late 1986 the report said The embassy estimated Indonesias calendar 1986 raw sugar production at 18 mln tonnes against a government estimate of 199 mln It said that Indonesias move into sugar self-sufficiency in 1984 may have been short-lived The report said The government continues to promote sugarcane production through its smallholder intensification program and a relatively high guaranteed price to sugarcane producers However there are considerable indications that farmers are reluctant to plant cane because its economic return is not as good as that of other crops

10299	The Philippines will ask the US Agriculture Department USDA to increase its 1987 sugar import quota following market reports that Taiwan will not be able to fulfil its quota Sugar Regulation Administration SRA chairman Arsenim Yulo said Yulo told Reuters the SRA would also protest a USDA move to award Taiwans shortfall to the Dominican Republic The Dominican Republic already has a larger sugar quota Yulo said Any Taiwanese shortfall should be awarded to the Philippines or at the least we should share a hike with the Dominican Republic The USDA last December listed 1987 sugar import quota allocations for the Dominican Republic at 160160 short tons and for Taiwan at 10920 short tons The Philippines has said it was badly hit by a cut in its quota to 143780 short tons from 231660 in 1986
10306	Philippine sugar production in the 198788 crop year ending August has been set at 16 mln tonnes up from a provisional 13 mln tonnes this year Sugar Regulatory Administration SRA chairman Arsenio Yulo said Yulo told Reuters a survey during the current milling season which ends next month showed the 198687 estimate would almost certainly be met He said at least 12 mln tonnes of the 198788 crop would be earmarked for domestic consumption Yulo said about 130000 tonnes would be set aside for the US Sugar quota 150000 tonnes for strategic reserves and 50000 tonnes would be sold on the world market He said if the government approved a long-standing SRA recommendation to manufacture ethanol the project would take up another 150000 tonnes slightly raising the target The government for its own reasons has been delaying approval of the project but we expect it to come through by July Yulo said Ethanol could make up five pct of gasoline cutting the oil import bill by about 300 mln pesos Yulo said three major Philippine distilleries were ready to start manufacturing ethanol if the project was approved The ethanol project would result in employment for about 100000 people sharply reducing those thrown out of work by depressed world sugar prices and a moribund domestic industry Production quotas set for the first time in 198788 had been submitted to President Corazon Aquino I think the President would rather wait till the new Congress convenes after the May elections he said But there is really no need for such quotas We are right now producing just slightly over our own consumption level The producers have never enjoyed such high prices Yulo said adding sugar was currently selling locally for 320 pesos per picul up from 190 pesos last August Yulo said prices were driven up because of speculation following the SRAs bid to control production We are no longer concerned so much with the world market he said adding producers in the Negros region had learned from their mistakes and diversified into corn and prawn farming and cloth production He said diversification into products other than ethanol was also possible within the sugar industry The Brazilians long ago learnt their lessons Yulo said They have 300 sugar mills compared with our 41 but they relocated many of them and diversified production We want to call this a sugarcane industry instead of the sugar industry He said sugarcane could be fed to pigs and livestock used for thatching roofs or used in room panelling When you cut sugarcane you dont even have to produce sugar he said Yulo said the Philippines was lobbying for a renewal of the International Sugar Agreement which expired in 1984 As a major sugar producer we are urging them to write a new agreement which would revive world prices Yulo said If there is no agreement world prices will always be depressed particularly because the European Community is subsidising its producers and dumping sugar on the markets He said current world prices holding steady at about 760 cents per pound were uneconomical for the Philippines where production costs ranged from 12 to 14 cents a pound If the price holds steady for a while at 760 cents I expect the level to rise to about 11 cents a pound by the end of this year he said Yulo said economists forecast a bullish sugar market by 1990 with world consumption outstripping production He said sugar markets were holding up despite encroachments from artificial sweeteners and high-fructose corn syrup But we are not happy with the Reagan Administration he said Since 1935 we have been regular suppliers of sugar to the US In 1982 when they restored the quota system they cut ours in half without any justification Manila was keenly watching Washingtons moves to cut domestic support prices to 12 cents a pound from 18 cents The US Agriculture Department last December slashed its 12 month 1987 sugar import quota from the Philippines to 143780 short tons from 231660 short tons in 1986 Yulo said despite next years increased production target some Philippine mills were expected to shut down At least four of the 41 mills were not working during the 198687 season he said We expect two or three more to follow suit during the next season

10687	Dry areas of the Australian sugar cane belt along the Queensland coast have been receiving just enough rain to sustain the 1987 crop an Australian Sugar Producers Association spokesman said The industry is not as worried as it was two weeks ago but rainfall is still below normal and good soaking rains are needed in some areas notably in the Burdekin and Mackay regions he said from Brisbane Elsewhere in the far north and the far south of the state and in northern New South Wales the cane crop is looking very good after heavy falls this month he said The spokesman said it is still too early to tell what effect the dry weather will have on the size of the crop which is harvested from around June to December He said frequent but light falls in the areas that are short of moisture such as Mackay mean they really only need about three days of the regions heavy tropical rains to restore normal moisture to the cane But rainfall in the next two or three weeks will be crucial to the size of the crop in the dry areas he said Its certainly not a disastrous crop at this stage but it might be in a month without some good falls he said

to avoid overstimulating output and straining the accords support operations - and intervention rules that avoid the risk of exports by non-members undermining the pacts Consumers and producers mindful of ITC buffer stock losses have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned a generalised approach to commodity price stabilisation and prefer to assess each commodity case by case the survey showed The International Cocoa Organization ICCO last week set precise limits on what the Buffer Stock Manager BSM could do under the new agreement It imposed daily and weekly purchase limits prohibited the BSM from operating on futures markets and stipulated after consumer insistence that up to 15 pct of total buffer stock purchases could be of non-member cocoa This will help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia the worlds fourth largest producer undermining the market The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the Buffer Stock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades A new International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA was adopted earlier this month in Geneva Importing and exporting countries agreed several changes to make the reference price more responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions under which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance operations Direct cash contributions from members will fund buffer stock purchases Bank financing was a particular feature of the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling Legal wrangles continue Recent International Coffee Organization ICO negotiations in London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that agreements reflect market reality commodity analysts said Consumers and a small group of producers argued that objective criteria should be used to define export quota shares which would have meant a reduction in the share of Brazil the worlds leading producer Brazil wanted to maintain its previous quota share of 30 pct The talks broke down and although an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term negotiations on export quota distribution as remote International agreements exist for sugar and wheat These do not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for discussions on possible future economic agreements collect statistics and draw up market analyses Analysts said differences between sugar exporting countries have held up any progress towards an accord with economic teeth while sheer competition between major exporters amid a world grain glut militate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat An alternative focus for commodity discussions are international study groups made up of governments with advice from industry such as those for lead and zinc and rubber The UN Common fund for commodities with a planned directly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs has failed to become operational because neither the US Nor the Soviet Union has ratified it US Officials in Washington said the US Doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives citing the lack of widespread support US Officials in Washington and Malaysian officials in Kuala Lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commodity pact case by case US Officials said it has been willing to study individual cases for economically sound market-oriented commodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests We see little to be gained by attempting to increase the price of a commodity whose long-term trend is downward official Administration policy states The US Currently belongs to only two international commodity agreements that have economic clauses - the International Coffee Agreement ICA and INRA - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat pacts The US Did not join the International Cocoa Agreement because it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and not designed to protect the interests of consuming countries the State Department said US Officials singled out the INRA as the one commodity agreement that seems to be working US Negotiators were successful in getting other members of the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment mechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect market trends and also to continue the accord as a market oriented agreement US Officials said Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they have consistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts on the merits of each case Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur his country the worlds top producer of rubber tin and palm oil decides its participation in international commodity pacts case by case Malaysia is a member of the Association of Tin Producing Countries ATPC which produce 65 pct of world tin The ATPC launched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96000 tonnes for a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50000 from 70000 Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture and delegate to cocoa wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron told Reuters in London Agreements with economic clauses to stabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were close to market reality if there was full participation by producers and consumers and if participants were prepared to take their obligations in the framework of the agreement seriously But Baron added No real sanctions are available for a country that doesnt stick to its obligationsThe German approach is sceptical We dont think agreements are the best instrument to help developing countries They were never meant to be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how developing countries often interpret them Traditionally Britain has always been supportive of commodity agreements reflecting its strong links with Third World producing countries But recently demands for more stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the need for intellectual honesty and objective criteria have grown British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree of transparency and do not contain the risk of open-ended borrowing that occurred in the tin pact they said UK Delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to reflect changes in market structure and price trends rather than dictate what prices should be A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges price realism in commodity pacts adding high prices inflate supply A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourable to commodity pacts France a large consumer and producer of sugar favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real market situation particularly regarding stocks Indonesias Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja told Reuters in Jakarta These agreements can work as long as the problems are cyclicalBut its another matter when there are structural problemsBut we are still committed to commodity agreements as an act of faith Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producers cannot afford not to give their backing to commodity agreements The political will is not there on the part of some consumers to make agreements work Martinez Cuenca said The head of the economics department in the Brazilian Foreign Ministry Sebastiao do Rego Barros told Reuters an agreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market reality If you have an agreement such as coffee with a system of quotas with a link between prices practised inside the pact and actual market prices it can work UNCTAD spokesman Graham Shanley said consuming countries realise steady export earnings enhance developing countries ability to service debt and mean greater demand for industrialised nations capital goods

12778	The recent fall in world sugar prices due to increased producer pricing sales and evidence of export availability has encouraged renewed buying interest from China and the Soviet Union London trade house EDAnd F Man said Further purchases are expected by the Peoples Republic of China at the lower end of the recent price range which should limit the downside movement it said in its latest monthly market report And it is believed that the Soviet Union will need to return to the market to take a further 250000350000 tonnes for MayJune shipment Man added The Soviets purchased five cargoes of raws for AprilMay shipment towards the end of last month which brings its total purchases to around 165 mln tonnes Man said Production estimates for the Thai crop now exceed 23 mln tonnes and the final outturn appears set to reach around 25 mln tonnes However this upturn in the Thai crop is being countered by a reduction in Chinas production forecast to 53 mln tonnes from 55 mln estimated earlier Market participation by Cuba suggests that its crop could be close to last years 73 mln tonnes But even with similar production Man expects Cuban exports to be significantly down Cuba was reported to be carrying 13 mln tonnes of stocks in September 1985 of which some 440000 tonnes were used to boost its 198586 exports to about 69 mln But as it will not be able to draw on surplus stocks this year Man estimates Cubas export availabilty will be reduced to 64 to 65 mln tonnes However Cuba is only one of a large number of exporters with reduced availability Man said Since 1980 the total free market export supply has fallen to 18 mln from about 22 mln tonnes But at the same time free market demand has also fallen by almost the same amount which has left exporters chasing falling import requirements A fairly tight balance now appears to have emerged But the difficult task of keeping production advances at bay still remains as at least one more season of production deficit is needed to eliminate some of the remaining surplus stocks still overhanging the market Man said The increasing cases of record production as a result of record yields and better husbandry have forced sugar producers to strive for greater efficiency As this increase in efficiency reduces the marginal cost of production sugar exporters may become more responsive to prices and in particular to upward price movements Man said Commenting on the current row between the EC Commission and sugar producers Man said despite the recent improvement in the level of restitutions they are still insufficient to fully compensate producers when exporting on the world market Unless there are further improvements at least some sugar is expected to remain in intervention it added

2521	Brazils recent announcement of a suspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign debt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views among many international economists and commodities analysts that Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987 The developing worlds most indebted nation is also its most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and soybeans and might maximize foreign exchange revenue by selling hard on world markets economists said That sounds like a reasonable strategy But there is no way they can trade their way out of this situation Aldo Roldan Vice President for International Services at Chase Econometrics said Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted world markets but also had to work to make its position on foreign exchange markets more profitable Domestic costs have increased due to inflation and exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange rates Roldan said The Chase economist also said commodities markets were depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a country like Brazil where pure commodities account for some 50 pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23 billion dlrs But he added They are always pretty aggressive and they have good foreign marketing channels Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be coffee and even without background pressure from foreign creditors the worlds largest producer was expected to hit the market this year with a vengeance Negotiations between International Coffee Organization ICO members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing each other of intransigence Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations which others wanted changed one senior coffee dealer said The dealer who declined to be named said Brazil wanted to preserve its market share At the end of the talks he said Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others would suffer Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales the dealer said If they do come into the market at this level it will go lower and you could breach a dollar ninety or eighty cents he said New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 229 cents lower Thursday at 10468 cents a lb while more distant deliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute Jorio Dauster told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of the ICO talks on export quotas Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the focus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts They will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been according to Richard Loewy analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc Loewy believes the foreign debt problem a good crop plus difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the Brazil soybean crop Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and they cant afford to store the crops he said The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time about large South American crops developing under near ideal conditions towards record yields We are going to see a very rapid decline earlier than usual this year in our US exports Loewy said Tommy Eshleman economist for the American Soybean Association ASA said this years Brazilian soybean harvest could total 18 mln tonnes versus 137 mln last year Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the vulnerability of the US crop to bad growing weather Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a reduction in the US government soybean loan rate offered to farmers who give crops as collateral Eshleman said He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the soybean loan rate which acts as an effective floor for prices by keeping supplies away from the free market Farmers can forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the loan Were getting into a period when they Brazil are starting to harvest and starting to export Eshleman said But he added it will be a while before US exports fall to below 10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel Burnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much as it can this year because of its economic situation He said the debt situation was a major consideration The Brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for storage he added Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops Melicias said it would not make a big difference On other commodity markets Brazils selling impact may be muted no matter its need to generate capital Brazil is faced with a poor 198687 sugar harvest which could limit exports to the world market analysts said The country may have oversold and be unable to honor export commitments and this plus higher domestic demand caused by consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar will give it little room to stretch exports they said Brazils other major crop cocoa is in its third year of surplus Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it fell so I dont think they can start throwing out cocoa and find many more markets for it one analyst said If they come out as aggressive sellers the market would collapse and they cant afford to do that she added

analysts and agricultural experts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improved seed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this In recent years good autumn weather has given yields a late boost making up for lower areas despite some disappointing starts to growing seasons Changes in EC areas reflect the extent to which producers will grow so-called C sugar for unsubsidised sale to the world market This is what is produced in excess of the basic area needed to meet the EC A and B quotas which receive full and partial price support respectively Some analysts said the open row that broke out last week between producers and the EC commission over its export policy could have serious implications for future sugar output Beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearly one mln tonnes of white sugar into EC intervention stocks as they feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate for the gap between high EC internal and low world market prices However with the EC budget stretched to breaking point this could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resisting higher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a future cut in the basic A and B quotas they added In France the largest producer of EC quota and non quota sugar the sugar market intervention board FIRS said first planting intentions indicate an area about the same as last years 421000 hectares nine pct below the previous year The basic trend is towards stability a FIRS spokesman said Unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars white sugar French franc prices are not particularly high and are not encouraging higher planting levels he said Beet sugar output last year was 337 mln tonnes with an average yield of 800 tonnes per ha the highest in the EC apart from the Netherlands but below 852 the previous year and a five year average 811 In West Germany recent price rises have not altered plans since planting decisions were taken a few months ago industry sources said The farm ministry said a December survey is still valid and plantings should be cut slightly after being trimmed by just under four pct in 1986 when yields were above average Licht last week estimated West German plantings at a reduced 385000 hectares against 399000 last year British Sugar Plc the monopoly beet processor has signed up UK Farmers to grow 81 mln tonnes of beet This should yield about 125 mln tonnes of whites Last years crop equalled the second highest ever at 132 mln tonnes British Sugar has A and B quotas totalling 1144 mln tonnes of whites and its C output is due to improved yields from more consistent disease-resistant seed types Recent price rises have not altered Polish plans Wincenty Nowicki a deputy director of Cukropol the Amalgamated Sugar Industry Enterprises said World prices are still below Polish production costs and there is no way to convince farmers to increase the area above the already signed contracted level The national plan set before prices began to rise put plantings this year at 460000 hectares against 425000 in 1986 Nowicki said Last year production was 174 mln tonnes World prices have less impact in Italy than in France or Germany as it is traditionally not an exporter but is geared to the domestic market an official at the national beet growers association said Italian sowings are not yet complete but surveys suggest a drop from last years 270000 ha especially in the north where some farmers have switched to soya Beet output last season of 155 mln tonnes yielded a higher than expected 172 mln tonnes of white sugar Dutch plantings are expected to fall to 130000 ha from a record 137600 in 1986 as a new self-imposed quota system comes into force a spokesman for Centrale Suiker the second largest Dutch sugar processor said The new system aims for an average of around 915000 tonnes of white sugar and to cut output of C sugar Last year the Netherlands produced a record 12 mln tonnes of white sugar against a combined A and B quota of only 872000 tonnes The world price of sugar would have to rise much higher than it has done recently to make planned production of C sugar really worthwhile the spokesman said Western agricultural experts in Moscow said Soviet planting intentions are likely to be unchanged Licht put this years Soviet beet area at 340 mln ha against 344 mln last year Hungary is expanding its beet area to 105000 ha from some 95000 in 1986 the official MTI news agency said but diplomats said policy is to balance supply with domestic demand The Spanish ministry of agriculture said beet sowings are estimated unchanged at 180000 ha this year A spokesman for Denmarks largest beet concern De Danske Sukkerfabrikker AS said its 1987 sugar target was unchanged from 1986 at 365000 tonnes from a steady area of 60000 ha In Sweden where beet is grown just to meet domestic demand the planted area is seen little changed at 51000 ha against 51300 last year according to a spokesman for sugar company Svenska Sockerfabriks AB Last year Irish yields were the lowest for 10 years due to late sowings and the state-run Irish Sugar Plc said the 1987 plantings target is the equivalent of 36400 hectares down from 37600 in 1986
5835	Indonesian sugar output is forecast by the government to reach 2126 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 against projected consumption of 2039 mln tonnes Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi said Production in 1986 when Indonesia was forced to import sugar is officially estimated at 2016 mln tonnes against 1728 mln in 1985 The US Embassy said in its annual Agriculture Report on Indonesia there were growing signs that actual output was lower than official figures It estimated 1986 production at 18 mln tonnes and forecast little change for 1987 Indonesia imported 162000 tonnes of sugar towards the end of last year and in early 1987 to boost low stocks Affandi told reporters stocks fe127l to as low as 159000 tonnes at the beginning of 1987 Industry sources said this represented under one months consumption The minister said Indonesia should hold three months supply or 510000 tonnes A spokesman for the National Logistics Bureau which distributes and stores sugar said stocks this month were 489437 tonnes The harvesting season begins in April

6657	Latin American sugar producers are awaiting further rises in world market prices before moving to boost production official and trade sources said Although prices have risen to around eight from five US Cents per lb in the past six months they are still below the regions nine to ten cents per lb average production cost The recent rise in prices has placed producers on the alert Manuel Rico a consultant with the Group of Latin American and Caribbean Sugar Exporting Countries GEPLACEA told Reuters However Rico said it would require another five to seven cents to stimulate notable increases in output Producers are taking measures for increasing their production when the prices are profitable he said Officials in Mexico Guatemala and Ecuador said a continued rise in prices would stimulate production but industry leaders in Panama and Costa Rica said there was still a long way to go The prices are ridiculous said Julian Mateo vice president of Costa Ricas Sugar Cane Industrial-Agricultural League At current prices nobody is going to consider increasing production Other producers are wary of committing funds to increasing output given the instability of world markets An official at Colombias National Association of Sugar Cane Growers said they had no plans to raise export targets The market is very unstable What is happening is not yet giving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modify anything In 1985 the latest year for which full figures are available Central and South American nations produced 28 mln tonnes raw value of sugar of which 123 mln were exported A year earlier they had produced and exported about 800000 more according to the London-based International Sugar Organization Years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugar industry in many countries in the region into a recession from which it will be hard to recover Miguel Guerrero director of the Dominican Republics National Sugar Institute said it would be difficult to boost production even if prices recovered sharply Output had slumped to under 450000 tonnes a year from 900000 in the late 1970s Obsolete refineries poor transport and badly maintained plantations were barriers to any short term recovery in output he added Plans of nearby Cuba the worlds largest cane sugar exporter to increase output to 10 mln tonnes a year by the end of the decade seem ambitious trade sources said Output is running well below the record 86 mln produced in 1970 Cuba suffers from run down plantations harvesting problems and poor processing facilities more than from low world prices since much of its output is sold to Eastern Bloc countries under special deals Last year bad weather added to its troubles and output fell to 72 mln tonnes from 82 mln in 1985 The low world prices of recent years have led many countries in the region to cut exportable production to levels where they barely cover US And in the case of some Caribbean countries European Community EC import quotas for which they receive prices well above free market levels Progressive reductions in the US Quotas have led to production stagnating or falling rather than being shifted to the free world market Peru for example shipped 96000 tonnes to the US In both 1983 and 1984 This fell to 76000 in 1986 and this year its quota is only 37000 A national cooperative official said that as long as world market levels continue at around half of Perus production cost the future of the industry is uncertain At a meeting of GEPLACEA in Brazil last October officials stressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar cane which according to the groups executive-secretary Eduardo Latorre grows like a weed throughout the region Brazil the largest cane producer with output of around 240 mln tonnes uses over half to produce alcohol fuel Cane in excess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined into sugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency The difference in the price the state-run Sugar and Alcohol Institute IAA pays local industry and what it receives from foreign buyers costs the government some 350 mln dlrs a year Soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over the past year coupled with a drought-reduced cane crop has meant Brazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in 1987 trade sources said Negotiations to delay shipments to next year have been indecisive so far the main sticking point being how Brazil should compensate buyers for non-delivery of sugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which would cost eight cents to replace Brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar export sales were expected to be extremely low for the next year with the Institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages of either alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuild depleted reserve stockpiles However the situation could change dramatically if the economy goes into recession and internal demand slumps Sources within Latin America and the Caribbean hold little hope for the regions sugar industry to return to profitability unless the US And EC change their policies The agricultural policies of the European Community and of the United States have caused our economies incalculable harm by closing their markets by price deterioration in international commerce and furthermore by the unfair competition in third countries Brazils Trade and Industry Minister Jose Hugo Castelo Branco told the October GEPLACEA meeting The EC has come under prolonged attack from GEPLACEA for what the group charges is its continued dumping of excess output on world markets GEPLACEA officials say this is the main cause of low prices GEPLACEA sees a new International Sugar Agreement which would regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling the regions industry out of steady decline Such an agreement would have to have both US And EC backing and industrialised countries would have to see it as a political rather than a merely economic pact They have to realise that the more our economies suffer the less capcity we have to buy their goods and repay the regions 360 billion dollar foreign debt GEPLACEAs Latorre said

6939	Cuban sugar output this season 198687 is put at around 75 mln tonnes raw value by broker CCzarnikow in its monthly sugar market review Allowing for around 700000 tonnes for the current years domestic usage it would leave around 68 mln tonnes for export of which Czarnikow estimates about 37 mln tonnes will be taken by the USSR 1530 mln by other socialist countries and the remainder for delivery to non-socialist bloc destinations Czarnikow also estimated USSR 198687 production at 875 mln tonnes raw value which when added to the 37 mln imports from Cuba and set against its estimated domestic and export needs of 142 mln tonnes will leave a gap of 175 mln tonnes to be acquired from the world market Soviet purchases to date may not be far short of that quantity Czarnikow said
6998	The rebate granted at yesterdays EC sugar tender represents some concession to producers complaints that they are losing money on exports outside the bloc EC Commission officials said The maximum rebate of 44819 European currency units Ecus per 100 kilos was 13 Ecus below what producers say is needed to obtain the equivalent price to that offered for sales into intervention The rebate at last weeks tender was 25 Ecus per 100 kilos short of the level producers said was needed the officials said The officials said the Commission is not negotiating with producers who have offered a total of 854000 tonnes of sugar for sale into intervention in an apparent attempt to persuade it to offer higher rebates They said the French and German producers involved are now unable to withdraw this offer before April 1 when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores Payment for it is due five weeks later and it will be open to them to withdraw their offers at any time between April 1 and the official payment date when the Commission officially takes ownership of the sugar the officials said The officials said if the Commission has to buy the sugar it is determined to immediately resell it a move which would drive down market prices further They expressed some hope that the operators would not eventually go through with their plan for intervention sales We think they realise they have gone too far one official said
7308	Sugar which EC producers plan to sell into intervention may be offered by the European Commission for sale within the Community broker C Czarnikow says in its latest sugar review The Commission will propose to offer the sugar at a very nominal premium of 001 European Currency Unit Ecu to the intervention price with detrimental consequences for producers returns Czarnikow says The move is seen as an attempt to persuade the producers to take back the surrendered sugar The Commission may also take other steps to dissuade producers from their chosen course such as removing the time limit on storage contracts which presently means that intervention stocks have to be removed by the end of September Czarnikow says There is also the possibility of production quotas being reduced If the Commission decided to offer the sugar to traders for export the restitutions would have to be higher than those at recent export tenders Czarnikow notes To match the difference between the EC price and the world market price the extra costs might be as much as 20 Ecus per tonne it says The producers might have to repay these costs through production levies and the proposed special elimination levy Czarnikow says but it would be several months before any costs could be recovered under EC rules The primary cause of the plan to sell 775000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in France is dissatisfaction with the EC export program as the restitution has increasingly failed to bridge the gap between the EC price and the world market price Czarnikow notes The French move is thus seen as a form of protest designed to force the Commissions hand In West Germany 79250 tonnes have been tendered for intervention but Czarnikow says the motive here is to ensure that the 198687 price is paid for sugar that was produced in 1986 In addition to a two pct cut in the intervention price West German producers face a further price reduction in July with a probable revaluation of the green mark Even if the immediate crisis is resolved the problem is not expected to disappear permanently It has appeared to traders for some years that the ECs export policy is insufficiently responsive to changing patterns of demand it says The weekly tenders should respond to fluctuating demand by increasing or reducing the tonnage awarded Czarnikow says suggesting that the Commission might also take steps to cut down the amount of unnecessary bureaucracy surrounding the export tender system
7501	Costa Rica has agreed to sell more than 32000 tonnes of sugar this year to the Soviet Union a spokesman for local producers said Miguel Alfaro president of the agricultural league of the sugar cane industry said the sale follows a recent 50 pct cut in Costa Ricas quota for sugar exports to the US Alfaro said up to 45000 tonnes of sugar could be exported to the Soviet Union this year under the deal which is similar to one the Soviets made recently with the Dominican Republic A Soviet ship will load 25000 tonnes at the Pacific port of Punta Morales Monday Alfaro said and a second ship will take an additional 7107 tonnes two days later Alfaro and other industry sources declined to disclose the price at which the sugar was sold
7510	Dominican Alfredo Ricart will take over as executive director of the International Sugar Organization ISO in mid-April ISO officer in charge Constantin Politoff said Previous ISO chief William Miller retired at end-February last year Ricart told Reuters his first aim is put the house in order by having a new administrative sugar pact with improved allocations of voting rights and financial contributions Once this is done time can be dedicated to working towards a new International Sugar Agreement ISA with economic clauses he said Ricart currently the Dominican Republics ambassador to Austria the Netherlands and the UN in Geneva said he will visit the four major exporters - Australia Brazil Cuba and the European Community - to talk to governments and producers and find out about problems that are preventing these countries finding common ground for a new sugar pact
7512	The International Sugar Agreement ISA will be renegotiated International Sugar Organization ISO officer in charge Constantin Politoff told Reuters after a special session of the pacts council A decision on how to renegotiate will be taken at the ISO six monthly session in May The alternatives are between an autumn London conference for another pact without economic clauses but a different voting and budgetary structure or a Geneva-based conference next year for a new pact with economic clauses he said But delegates said the latter would only be considered if the worlds four major exporters -- Australia Brazil Cuba and the European Community -- can resolve differences over how prices can best be supported and how to share the world Todays special session was called because the US earlier indicated it would only be able to pay 56 pct of its share of the ISO budget At todays council session Politoff said the US would try and find a way to pay the balance of about 50000 stg later this year Currently about three quarters of this years ISO 800000 stg budget has not been paid but delegates said the US caused controversy as it said it might not pay its full contribution in the last year of the current pact The Soviet Union has called for changes to the way the ISO budget is shared out Currently it is halved between importers and exporters and the Soviet Union has a 30 pct share of the importer half The Soviets want a new sugar pact to have only a single category of members who would all share the costs pro rata to their share of world sugar trade The ISO executive committee next meets on April 23 with the next full council session in the week of May 19 There are 12 importing and 44 exporting members of the ISO
7545	Three geographically diverse droughts in Asia are being linked by some scientists to a reintensification of the complex and little-understood El Nino weather pattern ltAccu-Weather Inc a commercial weather forecasting service said Rice and wheat farmers in China wheat and sugarcane growers in Australia and tea planters in Sri Lanka all face serious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrive in time to break the droughts offical reports government officials and meteorologists said Wen Wei Po a Hong Kong daily with close Peking links said the drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinces have been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months Rice planting is threatened in eight provinces it added Rainfall in the key farming provinces of Henan and Sichuan was 70 pct below average during February the lowest figure for over 20 years the paper said The dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pct compared with last March and lowered the water levels of many rivers it added This has resulted in reduced hydro-electric power causing shortages to industry and households The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century causing many ships to run aground Wen Wei Po said Unusually high temperatures have also been reported across China media reports said The Peoples Daily said Sichuan has recorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than average since early February The New China News Agency said the average December temperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higher than last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984 Severe drought is affecting about one-third of Sri Lanka and threatens to reduce the countrys tea crop Ministry of Plantation Industries officials told Reuters In Australia concern is growing about below-average rainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along the Queensland coast and in Western Australias wheat belt local Meteorological Bureau officials said For many farmers and government officials the fear is that while the present low rainfall does not yet pose a major threat the prospect of a dry autumnwinter season when the wheat crop is in its early stages certainly does they added Concern is heightened by the memory of the 198283 drought which devastated the wheat crop and coincided with the occurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known as El Nino they said Although meteorologists are cautious about linking the Asia-Pacific regions disrupted weather patterns to any single cause El Ninos role is being closely studied they said Accu-Weather Inc which specialises in providing data for agriculture and shipping interests said each El Nino event was unique The El Nino does not always produce the same effects and the present occurrence is much less pronounced than the last major event in 198283 it said El Nino Spanish for Christ Child because it appears around Christmas is formed by the action of warm air bearing clouds and rain shifting from the Indonesian archipelago to the coast of Peru where it mingles with the cold waters associated with the Peru current and returns across the Pacific as the trade winds meteorologists said The winds strengthened by El Ninos pump effect raise the sea level off Australia and Indonesia they said When the winds drop the ocean seeking equilibrium sends a surge of warmer water back across the Pacific where it collides with the cold seas off Peru they said One effect of this heat exchange is to deflect the rain-bearing clouds away from Australia and Indonesia into the Pacific where they further disrupt other weather patterns The prospects for an end to the droughts vary Accu-Weather said China where the affected areas have received between 40 and 75 pct of normal rainfall will have to wait for the May-September rains it said The May-September rains normally provide the drought-striken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall In Australia areas of Queenslands coastal strip have received less than half the normal rainfall during the current wet season but prospects for increased rains are diminishing as the rainy season draws to an end In Sri Lanka the drought has come when rainfall should be at its maximum for the year The years secondary rains usually occur between April and June although it is not possible at this stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual
7569	The Agriculture Ministry said it revised its April-June sugar consumption estimate down to 623300 tonnes on a refined basis from 637800 estimated at the end of December It said the estimate for domestically produced sugar supply for the same period was revised to 190400 tonnes from the earlier estimate of 195100 tonnes while imports were revised to 402000 tonnes from the earlier 435800 tonnes It did not revise its sugar consumption estimate of 253 mln tonnes for the 198687 sugar year ending September 30 The ministry said the estimate for the 198687 years supply of domestically produced sugar was revised to 881000 tonnes from the earlier estimate of 863000 The estimate for 198687 imports was revised to 1642 mln tonnes from an earlier 1645 mln tonnes
8004	The US Agriculture Department formally transmitted to Congress a long-awaited proposal to drastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers for the cut with targeted income payments In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanying the Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987 Peter Myers Deputy Agriculture Secretary said the Reagan administration wants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning with the 1987 crop down from 18 cts now Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the government for the price support cut with targeted income payments over the four years 1988 to 1991 The payments would cost an estimated 11 billion dlrs Myers said The administration sugar proposal is expected to be introduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep John Porter R-Ill Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it is unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate because politically-influential sugar and corn growers and high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist The direct payment plan outlined by the administration targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually lowers payments over four years It also excludes from payment any output exceeding 20000 short tons raw sugar per grower For example on the first 350 tons of production a grower would receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988 45 cts in 1989 3 cts in 1990 and 15 cts in 1991 The income payments would be based on the amount of commercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985 or 1986 crop years whichever is less USDA said Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes in the sugar program because the current high price support is causing adverse trends in the sugar industry He said the current program has artificially stimulated domestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed corn sweeteners to make market inroads US sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a progressive contraction of the sugar import quota to only one mln short tons this year he said This has hurt cane sugar refiners who rely on imported sugar processing Furthermore USDA said the current sugar program gives overseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products a competitive advantage The result has been higher imports of sugar-containing products and a flight of US processing facilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on US consumers and industrial users In fiscal 1987 USDA said consumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than necessary for sugar Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap between sweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse impacts and trends which the sugar industry is currently facing Myers said The following table lists the rate of payments in cts per lb to growers and the quantity covered in short tons recoverable raw sugar under the administrations proposal to compensate sugar growers with targeted payments QUANTITY            1988     1989      1990      1991 First 350 tons         6000    4500     3000     1500 Over 350 to 700        5750    4313     2875     1438 Over 700 to 1000      5500    4125     2750     1375 Over 1000 to 1500    5000    3750     2500     1250 Over 1500 to 3000    4500    3375     2250     1125 Over 3000 to 6000    3500    2625     1750     0875 Over 6000 to 10000   2250    1688     1125     0563 Over 10000 to 20000  0500    0375     0250     0125 Over 20000 tons        nil      nil       nil       nil
8176	A settlement could soon be reached in the dispute between European sugar producers and the European Community over EC export licencing policies Jean-Marc Vernes president of French sugar producer Beghin-Say which is leading the protest told journalists today Our contacts with the EC authorities over the past few days indicate that we are moving towards a solution he said adding that if this happened the producers would withdraw the 854000 tonnes of sugar they have offered into intervention Vernes said that the protest involving 770000 tonnes of sugar from French producers alone was prompted by the ECs policy since mid-1986 of offering export rebates which failed to give producers an equivalent price to that they would obtain by offering sugar into EC intervention At last weeks tender the EC Commission made an apparent concession by offering a maximum rebate only 13 European currency units Ecus per 100 kilos below the level producers say is needed compared with the previous weeks rebate which was 25 Ecus below the necessary level Vernes would not say what form any compromise between the producers and the EC would take but he reaffirmed the long-term desire of producers to export to the world market providing they were not losing money by doing so Producers can withdraw their intervention offer after April 1 when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores or at any time over the following five weeks before the official payment date The EC has threatened to put the sugar back on the internal market if the producers refuse to withdraw their offers

9470	A leading US farm-state Congressman Jerry Huckaby D-La warned he will press next year for legislation to control domestic production of sweeteners perhaps including corn sweeteners if the industry fails to voluntarily halt output increases this year Were moving toward a direction where we could self-destruct the US sugar program Rep Huckaby chairman of the House agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar issues told Reuters in an interview Huckaby who told US sugarbeet growers earlier this year they must halt production increases said he will deliver the same message to Louisiana sugarcane growers Friday He also said he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject Huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domestic sweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further cuts in the sugar import quota now at one mln short tons I think if were talking about dropping the quota another half mln tons lets say youre getting to the point where the program might not work he said Ideally Id like to freeze things right where we are said Huckaby leading advocate for sugar growers in Congress A freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about the current level of 65 mln tons the corn sweetener share of the US market staying at just over 50 pct and US sugar imports holding at about 12 mln tons Huckaby said A decision on whether to seek legislation will not be made until 1987 output numbers are known late this year he said I feel like if we didnt expand production we could probably hold where we are indefinitely or at least through the 1985 farm bill without any changes in the sugar program Huckaby said However much depends on whether high-fructose corn syrup producers continue to expand their share of the US sweetener market from just over 50 pct Huckaby said He noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners will capture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market in the US But he said if there were an economic breakthrough in the production of a new crystalline corn sweetener which further expanded the corn sweetener share then US sugar imports might be eliminated and US sugar output severely reduced Huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refiner companies such as AE Staley and Archer Daniels Midland soon This program is advantageous to the corn users They have some natural legitimate self-interest in seeing that the program is preserved Huckaby said Huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to think about how domestic output could be controlled either through production allocations acreage or marketing controls Huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the Justice Department to determine if it would be legal to ask corn refiners to limit production I dont know if we will go this route but if we do theres a question in my mind at this point in time can you do that legally he said Asked if he would proceed with production controls without the support of corn refiners Huckaby said You build a fragile house if you do it that way Huckaby said he understands why US cane and beet farmers have expanded production because high sugar price support means returns from sugar are higher than competing crops such as soybeans and grain But he said for sugar growers as a whole expansion would not be good policy Huckaby said he has tried to stress in his speeches to sugar industry groups that if growers continue to expand they may be penalized retroactively under any production control legislation passed next year Huckaby said Congress is unlikely to approve any changes in the sugar program this year despite a Reagan administration proposal to drastically slash the program The administration proposal is so drastic that I dont think it will get up a head of steam Huckaby said He said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar price support is unlikely to be approved Instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program Huckaby said the Reagan administration should file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against the European Communitys sugar policy He said EC policies are the major cause of the depressed world sugar market
