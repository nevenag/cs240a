forces outside the boundaries of this country."

for export if the train line continued interrupted. Cobriza
produced the equivalent of around 40,600 fine tonnes of copper
last year.
    Maoist guerrillas using dynamite interrupted train traffic
two days ago when they blew up railway tracks and derailed a
train laden with minerals 225 km (135 miles) east of Lima at
Chacapalca, between the coast and Cobriza.
    An official at Minero Peru Comercial, Minpeco, Peru's state
minerals marketing firm, confirmed there had been no
declaration of force majeure on the shipments from Cobriza.
    Officials at National Train Company, Enafer, headquarters
in Lima, the Peruvian capital, declined to comment on when
train traffic would be restored to Cobriza.
    But an Enafer official, reached by telephone in the central
Andean city of Huancayo, near Chacapalca, said traffic could be
restored by Saturday.

Mount Isa Mines Holding Ltd plans to
acquire a 30 pct stake in Europe's largest primary copper
producer, Norddeutsche Affinerie AG, a spokesman for
Metallgesellschaft AG said.
    MIM intends to take Preussag AG's total 20 pct share in the
copper producer in exchange for some three pct of MIM's share
capital. MIM will also take another 10 pct now held by Degussa
AG, reducing Degussa's share to 30 pct from 40.
Metallgesellschaft's share will remain at 40 pct.
    The move is subject to approval of the federal cartel
office and supervisory boards of the companies involved.

The Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd
&lt;RGFJ.S> (RGC) Mt Lyell copper mine in Tasmania will stay open
for an extra five years following a new aid package from the
state government, RGC said in a statement.
    The mine had been scheduled to close in 1989 after the 40
series stopes were mined, but will now stay open until the
deeper 50 and 60 series have played out, probably in 1994.
    The Australian dollar's fall since 1985 also improved the
local dollar copper price, making the company profitable and
justifying the mining of deeper reserves at a copper grade of
about 1.95 pct against about 1.60 pct now, the firm said.
    Ore output will be cut, but the higher grades will keep
contained-copper output at current levels of about 24,000
tonnes a year, it said. Capital expenditure of about 18 mln
dlrs will be required over the life of the new plan, RGC said.
    The latest aid package is the third since 1977 for RGC, a
major employer in Queenstown on the thinly populated west coast
of Tasmania.
    The mine was kept open in 1985 after Tasmania gave RGC 10
mln dlrs in aid. The new package includes an eight mln dlr
advance to RGC at the long-term bond rate, power concessions
and deferred royalties and payroll taxes.

Zambia has stopped sending its copper
exports through South Africa, the official Times of Zambia
said.
    The newspaper yesterday quoted highly placed sources as
saying the state-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM)
was diverting its mineral exports away from South Africa, but
it did not say which alternative routes were being used.
    ZCCM officials declined to comment on the report, but
Standwell Mapara, general manager of the Tanzania-Zambia
Railway Authority (TAZARA), told Reuters recently virtually all
Zambian mineral exports had been channelled along the TAZARA
line to Dar es Salaam for the last three months.
    During that period no Zambian copper had been shipped
through Zimbabwe to the Mozambican port of Beira - the only
other available route which avoids South Africa, Mapara said.
    Last December TAZARA carried 36,000 tonnes of Zambian
mineral ore, the line's record for any one month period, he
added.
    Copper, cobalt and other mineral exports account for 95 to
98 pct of Zambia's foreign exchange earnings and President
Kenneth Kaunda told Reuters in a recent interview it was vital
for his country to assure new outlets for them, avoiding the
traditional route through South Africa.
    Referring to Zambia's preparations for a possible cut in
economic links with South Africa, Kaunda told Reuters in an
interview on March 1, "My main concern, of course, is the mines
because whatever happens we must continue to run the mines."
    According to Mapara, TAZARA handled 1.1 mln tonnes of
freight last year and is still working well below its present
1.4 mln capacity. Kaunda said that once preparations had been
completed for evacuating Zambia's mineral exports on safe and
dependable routes his government would look to increase its
usage of TAZARA for other types of cargo.
    The 1986 annual report of Zambia's state-run Metal
Marketing Corporation said 81 pct of the country's metal
exports were channelled through Dar es Salaam last year, versus
79 pct in 1985. The report said Zambian copper production fell
to 463,000 tonnes last year from 526,000 in 1985.
    Despite the official optimism about diversifying Zambia's
export routes, diplomatic sources in Lusaka expressed
reservations about the capacity of Dar es Salaam and Beira
ports to handle all of Zambia's mineral exports, even if they
could be hauled there by train.
    "The two ports cannot in any way and in their present form
handle the huge exports of Zambian copper," one western diplomat
said.
    "A serious disruption in copper movement to the markets
could be brought about as it would pile up at the two ports
which lack the facilities and space to handle the copper
tonnage," he added.

Copper shares, which have lagged
behind the market, should pick up steam this year on stronger
demand and improving prices for the metal, analysts said.
    "Copper prices should move up over the next four to six
quarters," said Daniel Roling of Merrill Lynch and Co &lt;MER>. "I
see average copper prices at 70 cts a pound in 1988, up from
around 63 or 64 cts, based on tight supply and continued world
economic growth."
    Other analysts see metal prices ranging from 65 to 68 cts a
pound this year and 70 to 73 cts in 1988.
    Analysts said Phelps Dodge Corp &lt;PD> will be a strong
performer because it is the largest U.S. copper producer.
    But Asarco Inc &lt;AR>, with about 45 pct of total sales from
copper, and Newmont Mining Corp &lt;NEM> are also potential
winners, they said. Newmont is spinning off 85 pct of its
copper operations to its shareholders.
    "In theory, Phelps is the best stock. It's the purest play
and benefits most from higher copper prices," one said.
    William Siedenburg of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co,
said Phelps has lowered costs and streamlined mining
operations. "They've accomplished a great deal," he said.
    The company's move into carbon black, a product used in
tires, should provide steady earnings, although not rapid
growth, as a hedge against a copper downturn, Siedenburg said.
He estimates Phelps will earn 2.45 dlrs in 1987 and 4.45 dlrs
in 1988, including tax benefits, versus 1.79 dlrs in 1986.
    Other analysts, including Clarence Morrison of Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc and Merrill's Roling, also recommend Phelps.
    Morrison projects Phelps will earn 3.25 dlrs in 1987 and
four dlrs in 1988, while Roling sees earnings at 2.75 dlrs this
year and around 3.50 dlrs next year.
    "The stock can go to the mid 30s," Roling said, from its
current level of around 30. But others see it climbing to 40.
    "Their (Phelps Dodge) costs are so low, they don't need
copper prices higher than 70 cts to make a lot of money," said
Vahid Fathi of Prescott Ball and Turben Inc. "The shares will
outperform the market over the next 18 months," he said.
    But Nick Toufexis of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc says
Newmont Mining is a more attractive investment. "We'd rather
place our bets with Newmont. Any way you slice it, I see a
significant premium to the current stock price," he said.
    After the spinoff, which closes next month, Newmont will
have gold operations, including 95 pct of Newmont Gold Co
&lt;NGC>, a 15 pct stake in its copper unit and energy operations,
Toufexis noted.
    Analysts see Newmont earning 2.85 dlrs to three dlrs in
1987 and about 3.75 dlrs in 1988, versus earnings of about 1.40
dlrs from operations in 1986.
    "I'd be buying up to 90," Toufexis said last week, when the
stock rose sharply to near that level. "But the shares are
probably worth about 108 dlrs (each)."
    Dean Witter's Morrison and Fathi of Prescott Ball like
Asarco, because of cost cutting and restructuring. Morrison
sees 1987 earnings at 1.25 dlrs and 1988 at 1.75 against losses
in 1986. Fathi projects Asarco will earn one dlr in 1987 and
from three dlrs to 3.25 dlrs in 1988.
    Roling of Merrill Lynch is recommending Cyprus Minerals Co
&lt;CYPM> in addition to Phelps Dodge. Cyprus has interests in
coal and other minerals aside from copper.
    But Siedenburg of Smith Barney thinks Cyprus is overpriced
at current levels. "I would be willing to sell Cyprus and buy
Phelps Dodge if I were picking one copper stock," he said.

Minister of Mines Patrick Chitambala
confirmed that Zambia had ended copper shipments through South
Africa and announced that its state-run mining company had
closed down its liaison office in the white-ruled republic.
    He told the official Times of Zambia newspaper in an
interview the government was diverting all mineral exports
along rail routes to Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and Beira in
Mozambique. Chitambala declined to say what volume of copper
and other minerals were being shipped through these two ports,
but he said there had not been any problem with the new
arrangements.
    "So far our copper has been reaching its destinations
without hindrance," he told the Times.
    The Times of Zambia quoted unnamed sources as saying Zambia
exported 100,000 tonnes of copper through Dar es Salaam and
17,000 through Beira in the last quarter of 1986. Diplomatic
sources in Lusaka had earlier expressed doubts over Zambia's
ability to ship all its copper through Beira and Dar es Salaam
without causing massive bottlenecks at the ports.
    Chitambala also said that the state-run Zambia Consolidated
Copper Mines (ZCCM) had closed its liaison office in
Johannesburg, since it was now redundant.

Representatives of the International
Wrought Copper Council (IWCC) and major copper producers have
told the London Metal Exchange (LME) a clear statement of its
forward strategy would lead to a better understanding between
industry and the LME.
    In a press release the IWCC said that at the latest meeting
between the copper industry and the LME to discuss the new
clearing house system, industry expressed grave concern about
latest proposals made by at least one LME member for a cash
cleared market to replace the planned clearing system which
will retain the prompt date settlement basis.
    Copper industry delegates told the LME a decision to change
(the planned clearing system) would indicate a fundamental
change in the function of the LME and in its service to the
industry, the release said.
    By deterring industry use of the Exchange for hedging and
physical needs it would remove many of the unique advantages
currently offered by the LME and make it indistinguishable from
non-trade orientated markets such as Comex.
    The LME had to decide whether dealer convenience should
take a higher priority over customer satisfaction, industry
delegates said.
    The IWCC release also said the LME had confirmed that no
change would be made to the clearing system planned to start on
May 29. But it had indicated that consideration would be given
in due course to the cash clearing proposal, made by
Amalgamated Metal Trading at a LME members meeting last week.
    A copper industry spokesman suggested that some assurance
of permanence in the new clearing system would remove industry
fears of uncertainty resulting from an endless process of
review and change, the press release said.

Chilean left-wing leaders were
elected by the copper workers union for the first time since
the left-wing government of Salvador Allende was overthrown in
a 1973 coup.
     Nicanor Araya, a member of the Popular Democratic Movement
(MDP), was named president of the Chilean Confederation of
Copperworkers (CTC), which groups 22,000 workers employed in
the state-owned copper mines, union officials said.
    Other members of the MDP, which includes the communist
party and a faction of the socialist party, took five of the
principal positions on the union's directorate.
    The state-owned copper company of Chile (CODELCO) produces
around 90 pct of the country's copper output of some one mln
tonnes per year. Chile is the world's leading copper exporter
and sales account for just under 50 pct of its export income.
    The MDP won six out of the 14 places on the union's
directorate in elections earlier this month, with the christian
democratic party holding five and the remainder being won by
independents.
    But the left-wing was left in control of the union after
the christian democrats and independents failed to reach
agreement on a joint candidate for the presidency and withdrew
from negotiations.
    Union elections were called following the resignation of
former president Rodolfo Seguel last October.
    Seguel, a christian democrat and Chile's best-known union
leader, said he was forced to step down after repeated court
actions brought by CODELCO prevented the union from operating.
    The labour leader, who now heads the inter-union national
workers command (CNT), was among 500 workers sacked by CODELCO
following a strike in 1983.
    The strike, the only copper industry stoppage staged in the
past 13 years, marked the start of a wave of protests against
the military rule of President Augusto Pinochet.
     CODELCO argued that Seguel could not continue as union
leader when no longer employed by the company.

Copper shipments are likely to be
delayed because of power problems at &lt;Philippine Associated
Smelting and Refining Corp> (PASAR), the country's only
smelter, a company official said.
    Asked to confirm reports by New York copper trade sources
about PASAR's shipment problems, marketing manager Deogracias
Madrid told Reuters, "They are partly correct. There could be a
probable delay."
    Madrid declined to give more details, or production and
export figures, saying the information could lead to
speculation.
    PASAR's smelter is in the central province of Leyte.
    The New York trade sources said if PASAR's shipments were
delayed, customers might have to turn to the London Metal
Exchange for supply.
    "We have a commitment to our customers and I would not like
to comment on that," Madrid said.
    A spokeswoman for the Chamber of Mines said Philippine
copper production amounted to 222,644 tonnes in 1986, down
slightly from 226,157 tonnes in 1985. She said production in
the first two months of 1987 totalled 34,550 tonnes, compared
with 36,462 tonnes in the same 1986 period.

&lt;Houston Metals Corp> said the
the first phase of the underground rehabilitation, extensive
drilling and bulk sampling program at its Silver Queen Mine has
yielded positive results.
    Houston said representative assays from the 2,750 ft and
2,600 ft levels at the south end of the mine established ore
deposits in the following ranges: copper, 3.7 pct to 5.08 pct,
lead .99 pct to 1.5 pct, zinc six pct to 9.6 pct, silver 15.63
pct to 79.92 oz per ton, gold .062 to .19 oz per ton, germanium
93 to 103 grams per ton, gallium five to 18 grams per ton.
    In addition, Houston Metals said the weighted average of 25
diamond-drilled holes 375 ft below the 2,600 foot level and 800
ft along the strike assayed gold at .237 oz per ton, silver at
10.91 oz per ton and zinc at 8.99 pct.
    An apparent parallel vein structure at the 2,600 ft level
returned similar values, the company said.
    It added that preliminary metallurgical tests from
representative bulk ore samples indicate the commercial
feasability of producing a zinc and a copper-lead concentrate.
    Houston Metals said gold, silver and the base metals have
recoveries of 90 pct to 95 pct, with 95 pct of gold recovered
from better gold ores, while gallium, germanium and indium have
recoveries of between 66 pct to 82 pct and are included in the
zinc concentrate.
    The company's 1987 program of diamond drilling, underground
drifting and metallurgical evaluation is scheduled to start on
April.
    Houston Metals said it has a 60 pct interest in the Silver
Queen mines.
    It added that funds for the program have been provided by
First Exploration Fund, a Canadian limited partnership
sponsored by Merrill Lynch Canada Inc and Dominion Securities
Inc.
