200	The sharp decline in soybean crush ratios seen in the last few weeks accelerating in recent days has pushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean processing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean meal and oil The weekly US soybean crush rate was reported by the National Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 2178 mln bushels down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over the past two months when crush margins surged to the best levels seen in over a year Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed soybean futures and premiums higher prompting a pick-up in the weekly crush number However much of that export demand seems to have been met with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge in shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next few months US processors are now finding domestic livestock feed demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder than normal winter so they steadily dropped offering prices in an attempt to find buying interest soyproduct dealers said Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent weeks setting a new contract low of 13970 dlrs per ton in the nearby March contract today Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold May looking for no deliveries on first notice day tomorrow which would cause March to gain on deferreds one CBT crush trader said But theyve been bailing out this week because the March has been acting like there will be a lot delivered if not tomorrow then later in the month he added As a result of the weakness in soymeal the March crush ratio The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 226 cents per bushel today dropping over five cents in just the last two days The May crush ended today just over 17 cents so no processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable level the trader said Hopefully they will now start to cut back production to get supplies in line with demand he added With futures down processors are finding they must bid premiums for cash soybeans further reducing crush margins A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices down sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below the average cost of production cash dealers said Most soybean processing plants are still in operation with little talk of taking temporary down-time so far But processors will start halting production in the next few weeks it they continue to face unprofitable margins they added
235	Indonesias agriculture sector will grow by just 10 pct in calendar 1987 against an estimated 24 pct in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or declines the US Embassy said in a report Production of Indonesias staple food rice is forecast to fall to around 263 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 2658 mln tonnes in 1986 according to the annual report on Indonesias agricultural performance The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 267 mln tonnes with a forecast 273 mln tonnes output in 1987 The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 15 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 169 mln tonnes in 1986 because of a drawdown on stocks Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane rubber and copra show little or no gain the report says The modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans palm oil and palm kernels Constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds limited fertile land insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops the report underlines The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as wereng or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties and to use lower-yielding more resistant rice types The government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee tea rubber plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 70 pct in 1987 to 145 mln tonnes from 135 mln with exports rising to an estimated 720000 tonnes from 695000 tonnes in 1986 the report says But while production of soybeans in 198788 Oct-Sept will rise to 1075 mln tonnes from 980000 in 198687 imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant The report says that imports of wheat soybeans soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last Septembers 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand The report said that Indonesias overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s It compares with 19 pct growth in 1985 and 67 pct in 1984 The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump

13080	US scientists said some tropical vegetable oils can be hazardous to consumers whose health is at risk because of high levels of saturated fat lending weight to a campaign by the American Soybean Association ASA for labelling changes The scientists appeared to support an ASA charge denied by Malaysian palm growers that imported coconut palm and palm kernel oils contain high levels of saturated fat and thus raise blood cholesterol and the risk of heart disease In a petition filed in January the ASA asked the US Food and Drug Administration FDA to require palm palm kernel and coconut oils to be identified as saturated fats on food manufacturers labels The FDA responded to the ASA in a letter saying it would consider the petition as a comment to a proposed rule dealing with cholesterol and fatty acid labelling of foods Malaysian oil palm growers have said the charges by the ASA that palm oil consumption increases blood cholesterol and contributes to heart disease are untrue But Steve Chang Professor of Food Science at Rutgers University said Palm oil is definitely not good for human health because it has a high content of saturated fatty acid He added that the higher the fatty acid the greater the blood cholesterol level It has been well established that high cholesterol levels will have a higher level of heart disease he said A Malaysian Oil Palm Growers Council official Borge Bek-Nielsen has said studies have shown that palm oil is cholesterol-free low in saturated fats has anti-cancer properties and prevents blood clotting and blocking of arteries in humans Bek-Nielsen said Americans consume more saturated fats daily through food like butter bacon ham and beef than from palm oil which he added is rich in vitamins A and E David Kritchevsky Associate Director of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia appeared to take the ASA view on labelling What people really have to learn is to read labels said Kritchevsky The more a consumer knows the more likely he will make an intelligent choice The US scientists said they had no doubt imported palm palm kernel and coconut oils contain high saturated fat levels Kritchevsky a specialist in nutrition said More saturated fat would raise cholesterol levelsSo from that point of view its a health risk High cholesterol levels in the blood are a risk factor for heart disease Susanne Harris deputy assistant secretary of the US Agriculture Departments Food and Consumer Services Division said the health risk among consumers of vegetable oils with high saturated fat levels was highest among those who have heart disease The scientists said more than 50 pct of the fatty acid content of the tropical oils was saturated whereas less than 20 pct of the fatty acid content of soybean oil was saturated David Ericksen director of ASAs technical services said US soybean producers could regain about one-half of the 273 mln dlrs in sales lost to imported tropical oils if consumers were aware the vegetable oils were high in saturated fat Imported tropical oils displace 171 mln bushels of US soybean sales in the US market ASA estimates US imports of coconut oil during January totaled 829 mln lbs compared with 480 mln lbs in December and 1065 mln a year earlier according to Commerce Department figures Imports of palm oil totaled 440 mln lbs compared with 513 mln lbs in December and 852 mln a year earlier

3540	Lower production of coconut and palm oils could lead to a decline in vegetable oil stocks this year despite growing supplies of oilseeds senior oilseeds analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Mario Balletto said Balletto told a conference of Canadian farmers at Alberta Agricultures annual farm outlook conference that the world vegetable oil situation is one of potentially tight supplies Prices for edible oils appear to have more upside potential reflecting strong world demand and an unprecedented decline in the production of tree oils Balletto said Balletto estimated production of palm coconut and palm kernel oils this year at 85 mln tonnes down from 91 mln tonnes last year enough to offset higher oilseed output He estimated total vegetable oil production this year at 334 mln tonnes up from 330 mln last year and disappearance at 340 mln tonnes up from 326 mln Unless oilseed crushing increases sharply he said disappearance of vegetable oils could exceed production by 600000 tonnes the largest deficit since 1976 If world protein meal demand stagnates thus limiting the crush of soybeans  the need for serious supply rationing in the edible oils sector could develop he said This would be relatively favorable for the prices of high oil yielding seeds Balletto said Oilseeds on the other hand remain at depressed prices because of burdensome supplies he said World ending stocks of oilseeds are estimated to increase for the fourth straight year to a record 284 mln tonnes compared with 254 mln last year The increase should result from lower disappearance as production is expected to fall to 1840 mln tonnes from 1857 mln last year he said World soybean production in 1987 totalled a record 989 mln tonnes up from 906 mln the previous year Balletto said while production of other oilseeds was lower Higher soybean production in South America and Europe made up for lower production in the United States he said Soybeans account for the bulk of the surplus and US stocks make up most of those Balletto said The Commodity Credit Corporation owned 127 mln tonnes about half of the world soybean surplus he said Since 1983-84 he said world oilseed stocks have increased 131 mln tonnes During the same period US soybean stocks increased 121 mln tonnes becoming the dumping ground of the entire world surplus courtesy of the CCC and highlighting the artificially high prices caused by the US loan program Soybean prices and to a great extent world oilseeds prices are likely to be dominated by the loan program as long as the US soybean surplus continues For the 1987 crop he said prices are likely to hover in a range tied to the US loan program Upside potential for prices is limited by the huge supply overhang while strong underlying support is provided by the US loan rate The problem is likely to become worse as the artificially high prices encourage producers in South America Canada and Australia to shift from grains to oilseeds Balletto said

5169	Tense trade relations with the US And Japan and concern about the foreign impact of a proposed European Community EC tax on edible oils and fats are expected to dominate talks by EC foreign ministers here tomorrow EC diplomats said Britain demanded the early debate on the EC Executive Commissions proposal to impose a hefty tax on domestic and imported oils and fats in an attempt to head off a proposal it sees as extremely damaging to EC foreign relations The proposal was the most controversial part of a reform package due to be discussed by EC farm ministers later this month of the ECs Common Agricultural Policy -- widely seen as the root cause of the ECs persistent financial problems and of tensions with major trading partners The proposal is described by its promoters as a stabilisation program which would penalise a new sector going into massive overproduction and complement proposals to cut cereals and dairy production rather than a straight forward tax They say it would not only curb the growth of oils and fats production and prevent imports from filling any vaccum left by a fall in EC output but would also save the EC some two billion European Currency Units over two billion dlrs in farm costs It has provoked strong protests from domestic producers as well as foreign exporters led by the United States The diplomats said the protests had been received from most corners of the developing and developed world ranging from Senegal Malaysia and Indonesia to Brazil Argentina Canada Iceland and Norway The proposal had little chance of approval by EC governments with West Germany as strongly opposed to it as Britain and Denmark the Netherlands and Portugal also unconvinced of its political or economic wisdom Even Mediterranean countries such as Italy France and Greece which backed similar proposals in the past did not seem as enthusiastic now because olive oil had been added to the list of products affected But the diplomats said a protectionist lobby in the US And elsewhere was using the proposal as an excuse to promote anti-EC action and the foreign ministers debate should demonstrate the strength of feeling against the proposal within the EC and deprive its oponents of this argument The ministers were also due to discuss proposals in the US Congress for a range of protecionist legislation such as a bill that would curb EC textile exports The diplomats said the ministers were expected to strongly back a Commission warning to Washington that such a bill if enacted would provoke swift EC retaliation
