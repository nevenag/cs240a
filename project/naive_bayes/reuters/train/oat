197	US farmers who in the past have grown oats for their own use but failed to certify to the government that they had done so probably will be allowed to continue planting that crop and be eligible for corn program benefits an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said Currently a farmer to be eligible for corn program benefits must restrict his plantings of other program crops to the acreage base for that crop Several members of Congress from Iowa have complained that farmers who inadvertantly failed to certify that they had grown oats for their own use in the past now are being asked to halt oats production or lose corn program benefits USDA likely will allow historic oats farmers to plant oats but not extend the exemption to all farmers Lyngs aide said

1405	Chicago Board of trade grain traders and analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to handle their upcoming spring plantings prompting sales of new crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans in the futures markets Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because corn is protected by the acreage reduction program That gives deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they sign-up for reduced acreage but they have no price guarantees With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing rather than gamble on soybeans even though the new crop soybeancorn ratio of 291 would make planting soybeans more attractive under normal circumstances An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln more oat acres this year than last without being penalized traders said Here too acres some farmers may have been thinking of shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats due to the more attractive deal from the government they added Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six months ago which should prompt many farmers in the South to put soybean land back into cotton One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans which are easier to grow one commercial trader said
