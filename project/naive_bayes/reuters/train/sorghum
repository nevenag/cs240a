1131	The upcoming five-month deficiency payments to corn and sorghum farmers will be made half in cash and half in generic commodity certificates a senior Agriculture Department official told Reuters Around 300 mln dlrs of the in-kind certificates or certs will be mailed out to farmers around March 15 or 16 Tom von Garlem Assistant Deputy Administrator for USDAs state and county operations said The decision to make the payments in a 5050 cashcerts ratio was made Monday but payments to producers will be delayed until mid-month due to a problem with USDAs computer program von Garlem said get 115 cts per bushel in this next payment -- 575 cts in certs and around 55 cts cash 575 cts minus Gramm-Rudman Farmers who did not receive advance deficiency payments at signup will receive 63 cts per bushel Slightly more than half of this payment will be in cash von Garlem said but he said this will not markedly upset the 5050 ratio since most farmers got advance payments The final certificate payments will be very close to 300 mln dlrs he said When asked if the Office of Management and Budget had resisted the cashcerts ratio the USDA official said that we proposed 5050 and OMB accepted it
1369	Eligible producers of 1986 crop US corn and sorghum will receive an estimated 600 mln dlrs in deficiency payments -- 50 pct in generic commodity certificates and 50 pct in cash the US Agriculture Department said It said corn producers will receive about 515 mln dlrs and sorghum producers about 85 mln dlrs Only the cash portion of the payments will be subject to the 43 pct reduction in compliance with the Gramm-Rudman budget deficit control act of 1985 it said Corn and sorghum producers who requested advance deficiency payments have already received about 28 billion dlrs and 225 mln dlrs respectively USDA said The Department said deficiency payment rates of 515 cents per bushel for corn and 49 cents per bushel for sorghum were received by producers requesting advance payments Deficiency payments are calculated as the difference between an established target price and the higher of the basic loan rate or the national average price received by farmers during the first five months of the marketing year --September-January National weighted average market prices for the first five months of the season were 146 dlrs per bushel for corn and 133 dlrs per bushel for sorghum Eligible corn producers will be paid 63 cts per bushel based on the difference between the 303 target price and the 240 dlr per bushel basic loan rate Sorghum producers deficiency payment rate will be 60 cents per bushel based on the difference between the 288 dlrs per bushel target price and the 228 dlrs per bushel basic loan rate The deficiency payment rates for both commodities are the maximum permitted by law the department said Eligible corn and sorghum producers will receive another 1986 crop deficiency payment in October if the national average market prices received by farmers during the entire marketing year for both commodities are below the basic loan rates the department said The payments will be issued through local Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service offices it said
1582	Torrential rains throughout Argentinas grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarse grain harvesting in the week to yesterday trade sources said Sunflower maize and sorghum harvests were particularly affected they said But the rains proved to be a great aid to soybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April or May The rains did no damage to maize sunflower and sorghum crops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yields and cut the total volume of this years harvest Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires with the heaviest rains in the provinces western sectors between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa 10 and 75 mm in Santa Fe 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios five and 40 mm in Misiones and five and 50 mm in San Luis No rain was recorded in Corrientes Chaco and Formosa Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume of the coarse grain harvest over last weeks estimates Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central Santa Fe though slowly Growers had harvested seven to nine pct of total planted area compared to five to seven pct last week Total maize area planted for the 198687 harvest was estimated at between 358 and 378 mln hectares or two to seven pct less than the 385 mln hectares planted in the 198586 harvest Maize production is expected to total between 104 and 11 mln tonnes or a drop of 175 to 194 pct over the 124 to 126 mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates or 189 to 219 pct lower than last years volume according to official figures The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and nine pct of total planted area Two to 22 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowers for this harvest down 299 to 363 pct from last years figure of 314 mln hectares Sunflower production is expected to total between 24 mln and 27 mln tonnes which would mean a drop of between 341 and 415 pct against the record 41 mln tonnes harvested in the 198586 harvest Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two and four pct of total planted area which this harvest is 123 to 130 mln hectares or 103 to 152 pct less than the 145 mln hectares planted in the 198586 harvest Sorghum production is expected to total between 32 mln and 35 mln tonnes or 167 to 22 pct less than the 41 to 42 million tonnes harvested in 198586 Soybean production by contrast is expected to hit a record 80 to 84 mln tonnes which would mean an increase of 111 to 151 pct over last years record figure of 72 to 73 mln tonnes according to private estimates Official figures put last years soybean harvest at 71 mln tonnes Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very good condition helped by abundant rains and high temperatures Total soybean-planted area for the 198687 harvest is expected to be a record 37 to 38 mln hectares up 108 to 138 pct from last years harvest figure of 334 mln hectares

12052	The US Has been promised a near monopoly of maize exports to Spain from third countries guaranteed under an agreement with the European Community an EC official said The official who asked not to be named told Reuters that the guarantee was given in an unpublished clause of the agreement Under the accord which began in January third countries were guaranteed access for the next four years for two mln tonnes a year of maize to the Spanish market as well as 300000 tonnes of sorghum However the official said the US Had been assured that almost all the exports would be reserved for its traders The EC Commission is to ask member states to agree either a tender system to fix reduced import levies for the maize or to authorise direct imports by the Spanish intervention board EC sources noted that under a tender system maize from outside the US Would sometimes be offered on more favourable terms than that from the US No Commission spokesman was immediately available for comment
12160	Fresh heavy rains caused further damage to the Argentine 198687 coarse grains crop in the week to yesterday particularly in Buenos Aires province trade sources said They said the sunflower maize soybean and sorghum crops were damaged and yield estimates affected New production forecasts were made for all these crops The rains over the weekend and up to yesterday registered more than 200 mm on average in western Buenos Aires and worsened the flooding in various parts of the province The weather bureau said the rains which in Buenos Aires have surpassed 750 mm in the last 30 days could continue The northeast of the country was also hit by heavy rains In Corrientes province the rains also passed an average of 200 mm in some parts notably the Paso de los Libres area bordering on Uruguay In Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces they were over 100 mm in places in Misiones and San Luis 90 mm and in Cordoba 80 mm The rains were less intense in Chaco and Formosa Harvesting in areas not actually under water could also be further delayed due to dampness in the earth the sources said The excessive humidity might also produce rotting of the crops further dimishing the yield the sources added Sunflower harvesting before the weekend rains reached 26 to 30 pct of the area sown in Santa Fe Cordoba La Pampa and Buenos Aires provinces The production forecast for 198687 sunflowerseed has been lowered to between 22 and 24 mln tonnes against 23 to 26 mln tonnes the previous week making it 415 to 463 pct lower than the record 41 mln tonnes produced last season The area sown was two to 22 mln hectares down 299 to 363 pct on the record 314 mln hectares in 198586 The maize harvest advanced to within 26 to 28 pct of the area sown in Cordoba Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires It will begin in La Pampa within about 10 days weather permitting Maize yield this season is now estimated at 96 to 99 mln tonnes against last weeks 99 to 101 mln tonnes down 214 to 226 pct on the 124 to 126 mln tonnes at which private producers put 198586 production The new forecast is 227 to 25 pct down on the official figure of 128 mln tonnes for last seasons production The grain sorghum harvest reached 17 to 19 pct of growers targets against 14 to 16 pct the previous week The production forecast was reduced to between three and 33 mln tonnes against 32 to 35 mln tonnes last week 214 to 268 pct down on last seasons 41 to 42 mln tonnes The area sown with sorghum in 198687 was 123 to 130 mln hectares down 103 to 152 pct on the 145 mln in 198586 The forecast for soybean yield this season was the least changed in relation to last week It was put at a record 75 to 77 mln tonnes against the previous 75 to 78 mln tonnes These figures are 42 to 55 pct higher than last seasons record of 72 to 73 mln tonnes according to private sources and 56 to 85 pct up on the official 71 mln tonnes The adjustment to the production forecast is due to the rains and overcast conditions which have greatly reduced the sunlight needed for this crop sources said Producers fear estimates may yet have to be adjusted down further The humidity could induce rotting and growers are still finding more empty pods due to excessively dry weather earlier in the season Soybean harvesting is due to start in mid-April in southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires
12417	The agreement between the US And the European Community EC on special imports of maize and sorghum provides an equal chance for all non-EC countries to supply the Spanish market an EC Commission spokeswoman said She denied that any unpublished clause of the agreement guaranteed the bulk of the maize export business would go to the US As one EC official told Reuters yesterday Under the agreement the EC will import two mln tonnes of maize and 300000 tonnes of sorghum a year into Spain at specially reduced levy rates for the next four years The Commission has yet to decide whether the maize will come in through direct purchases by the Spanish intervention board or by a tender system

3981	Heavy rains fell again in Argentinas main grain growing areas in the week to yesterday trade sources said Rains fell heaviest early in the week and in particularly high volume in Buenos Aires province Cordoba La Pampa and Santa Fe provinces Rainfall totalled between 20 and 290 mm in Buenos Aires heaviest in western sectors of the province 20 to 145 mm in La Pampa 25 to 120 mm in Cordoba and 10 to 75 mm in Santa Fe Rainfall was lighter in other provinces Rainfall totalled from five to 50 mm in Corrientes five to 31 mm in San Luis five to 30 mm in Entre Rios three to 20 mm in Misiones 11 to 17 mm in Formosa and one to eight mm in Chaco Growers said it was still too early to tell whether the rains had damaged crops though they said maize and sunflower crops may have suffered Harvesting of both those crops and sorghum was paralysed by the bad weather For harvesting to resume as normal the rains would have to stop long enough for the soil to dry and allow farm machinery to operate The rains caused flooding in western and northwestern Buenos Aires as more than 750 mm have fallen in some areas there since February 23 while the annual average is 1200 mm Flooded areas total between 12 and 15 mln hectares Buenos Aires province governor Alejandro Armendariz said after flying over the flooded area Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figueras said only 500000 hectares of the area now flooded had been planted and that 200000 to 300000 hectares could be lost Growers said large parts of the flooded areas were not planted because they are low-lying and flood easily Trade sources said it was certain crops were damaged by the heavy rains but it was too early to tell the exact extent of the damage They said it was likely rain combined with high winds uprooted many sunflower and maize plants The sunflower harvest moved forward in the centre and south of Cordoba and Santa Fe and got underway in a few isolated areas of northern Buenos Aires Growers have harvested between 15 and 18 pct of total planted area up from seven to nine pct a week ago Estimates of the total volume of the sunflower crop were revised downward in light of the bad weather Estimates for total crop ranged from 23 to 26 mln tonnes down from 24 to 27 mln tonnes estimated last week and down 341 to 415 pct from last years record harvest of 41 mln tonnes Maize harvesting also advanced reaching between 13 and 15 pct of total planted area compared to seven to nine pct a week ago The maize harvest is expected to total between 10 and 102 mln tonnes down from the 10 to 104 mln tonnes estimated a week ago Last years maize harvest totalled 128 mln tonnes according to official figures Soybean production estimates were revised downward to 78 to 82 mln tonnes compared to estimates of eight to 84 mln tonnes a week ago Last years soybean harvest totalled 71 mln tonnes according to official figures Sorghum harvesting moved slowly forward reaching between four and six pct of total planted area compared to two to four pct a week ago Sorghum production estimates remained steady at 32 to 35 mln tonnes down 167 to 22 pct from the 41 to 42 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest
5467	A 092 program would have very little impact on US acreage prompting farmers to idle only an additional 35 mln acres of cropland every year according to a report from the Agriculture Department The savings resulting from the additional 35 mln acres idled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings 35 mln dlrs in transportation and storage savings and 10-20 mln dlrs per year in deficiency payment savings the report said The USDA report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 092 acreage program for wheat corn cotton sorghum and barley Last year almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested The likelihood that the 0-92 provisiion will cause very large acreages to be removed from crop production is quite small the report said The returns on typical farms still favor participation in the usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permitted acreage the USDA report said The 092 program which would allow farmers to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment would be most used by producers in high productionhigh risk areas where cost of production is high said Keith Collins director of USDAs economics analysis staff In the heart of the corn belt you would not get that much participation Collins said USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheat would be ildled under 092 15 mln acres of corn 500000 acres of sorghum and barley and 500000 acres of cotton Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40 mln bushels of wheat 180 mln bushels of corn 20 mln bushels of sorghum 10 mln bushels of barley and 500000 bales of cotton the report said In determining whether to participate a producer would need to weigh the expected cash costs of production against the loan rate  The risk that market prices may rise above the expected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must be considered according to the analysis What youre giving up under 092 is the difference between the loan rate and the cost of production Collins said For producers with low production costs that difference is greater and can be applied to paying variable costs he said Under these cicumstances farmers would not want to go along with 092 But for high cost producers 092 would be more attractive Also as loan rates get lower Collins said there would be more incentives to participate in a 092 program I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal at first but it is a step towards the goal of separating production decisions from government payments Collins said In a speech earlier today before the National Grains and Feed Association USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is too late to implement 092 for 1987 crops since program signup will be over by the end of this month
5610	Farmers enrolled over 65 mln acres of program crops in the latest conservation reserve program signup and around four mln acres of non-program crops Agriculture Department conservation specialists said Soybean acreage amounted to less than two mln acres of the non-program crop acreage enrolled a USDA analyst said Heavy enrollment of non-base acreage in wheat states of which a big percentage would be fallow and non-soybean land accounted for a large portion of the non-program acreage the analyst said Wheat and corn acreage comprised slightly over 40 pct of the total 10572402 acres accepted into the ten-year program USDA analysts gave the following enrollment breakdown -- wheat  2615140 acres -- corn   1894764 acres -- barley   705888 acres -- sorghum  585552 acres -- cotton   417893 acres -- rice       2035 acres -- peanuts      611 acres -- tobacco      285 acres -- total program crops  6512700 acres -- total nonprogram     4059702 acres -- total enrollment    10572402 acres USDA analysts are currently working on a complete state breakdown of crop acreage enrollment and should have it ready for publication later this week they said

6890	Argentine grain growers reduced their estimates for maize and soybean production in the current harvest in the week to yesterday trade sources said Soybean production for 198687 is now estimated to reach between 77 and eight mln tonnes versus 78 to 82 mln tonnes estimated a week ago and eight to 84 mln tonnes estimated in mid-February But even the lowest of those estimates would be 85 to 127 pct greater than last years total of 71 mln tonnes according to official figures and would be a new record The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was a record 37 to 38 mln hectares and increased 108 to 138 pct compared to the 33 mln hectares planted last year The change in yield estimates is due to very high temperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year in the soybean-producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires province The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybean pods empty especially in Cordoba Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops since rainfall was slight in most main soybean-producing areas Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak in Buenos Aires province totalling between one and 10 mm There was no recorded rain in other grain-producing provinces With clear skies and seasonable temperatures fields were able to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recent weeks allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize sunflower and sorghum harvesting Crops were considered in generally good condition though it is still too early to judge whether the intense rains of recent weeks caused any long-term damage The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of the total area planted compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at 358 to 378 mln hectares down two to seven pct from the 385 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest Total production for the current maize harvest is expected to reach between 99 and 101 mln tonnes versus 10 to 102 mln tonnes estimated a week ago The new figure is 211 to 227 pct lower than the 128 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest according to official figures The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct of total planted area versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was two to 22 mln hectares or 299 to 363 pct lower than the record 314 mln hectares planted in the 198586 harvest The current harvests volume was again expected to be between 23 and 26 mln tonnes or 341 to 415 pct lower than last harvests record 41 mln tonnes Yields varied widely from area to area and growers feared that heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll on crops and consequently on total production volume The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct of total planted area compared to four to six pct a week ago Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 12 and 13 mln hectares or 103 to 152 pct lower than the 14 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest Estimates for total sorghum production this harvest remained at 32 to 35 mln tonnes again this week or 167 to 22 pct lower than last harvests total volume of 41 to 42 mln tonnes

8446	The EC Commission will decide shortly precisely how to arrange the import of third country maize and sorghum into the EC in fulfilment of its agreement with the United States Commission sources said Under the accord reached following US complaints about the impact on its agricultural exports of Spanish EC membership the EC will import two mln tonnes of maize and 300000 tonnes of sorghum a year up to end of 1990 All this produce will be imported into Spain at special levy levels likely to be below those applying for imports into other EC countries The sources said it was possible that the Spanish intervention board would be asked to buy the produce directly this year as it was rather late to make other arrangements They added that the choice for future years appears to lie between a system of regular tenders and the setting of a daily special levy applicable to Spanish imports There will initially be no tax on re-exports of maize and sorghum from Spain to other EC countries although such a tax could be imposed later the sources added
8759	Rice and corn farmers will receive the largest payments from the US government during 1987 if the subsidies are calculated per planted acre the US Agriculture Department said USDA said government outlays to rice farmers in 1987 are expected to reach 403 dlrs per acre planted followed by corn at 135 dlrs per planted acre Government outlays include mainly deficiency payments and price support loans On a per acre basis cotton payments will reach 7324 dlrs in 1987 wheat 6030 dlrs sorghum 5438 dlrs barley 2741 dlrs and oats 231 dlrs USDA said USDA estimates farm subsidies will reach 253 billion dlrs in 1987 The figures were given by USDA officials at a Senate Agriculture Appropriations hearing yesterday
9521	Argentine grain producers again reduced their estimates for the total yield of the 198687 soybean crop which will begin to be harvested in mid-April trade sources said They said growers now forecast soybean production this season at between 75 and 78 mln tonnes down from last weeks estimate of 77 to eight mln tonnes and the 80 to 84 mln tonnes forecast in mid-February The new forecast is still higher than last seasons record total production Private sources put 198586 production at a record 72 to 73 mln tonnes -- 42 to 64 pct lower than the new forecast for the current crop The official figure for 198586 is 71 mln tonnes 56 to 99 pct below this seasons new estimates Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean pods in the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe provinces and northern Buenos Aires The crop since January has been hit by high temperatures and inadequate rainfall Growers fear they may find more empty pods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 37 to 38 mln hectares 108 to 138 pct higher than the 198586 record of 334 mln hectares The state of the crop continued to be good in general until last week but intense heavy rains since could have caused damage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm Where the rains were less heavy they were considered beneficial although too late to improve yield estimates The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops in southern Buenos Aires province but are not expected to influence production forecasts In other areas especially western Buenos Aires where rainfall was more than 200 mm parts of the sunflower maize and sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week by rains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba La Pampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios The area sown with maize this season was between 358 and 378 mln hectares two to seven pct less than the 385 mln hectares in 198586 The yield of 198687 maize continued to be forecast at between 99 and 101 mln tonnes This estimate is 198 to 202 pct lower than the 124 to 126 mln tonnes at which private sources put 198586 production and 211 to 227 pct lower than the official 128 mln tonnes The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of the area sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Aires although at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage is impossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days of sunshine dries the fields The area sown this season was 20 to 22 mln hectares down 299 to 363 pct on last years record 314 mln hectares Sunflowerseed 198687 production is still forecast at 23 to 26 mln tonnes 341 to 415 pct below the 198586 record of 41 mln tonnes The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by the rains advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and starting in La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown The area sown was 123 to 130 mln hectares 103 to 152 pct less than the 145 mln hectares the previous season Yield estimates remained at 32 to 35 mln tonnes 167 to 22 pct down on 198586 production of 41 to 42 mln tonnes
