6197	Surprisingly strong US housing statistics for February cannot be taken as an indication that the economy is generating any momentum and are not sufficient cause to start lifting forecasts for first quarter growth economists said Building was boosted by two factors last month unusually mild weather and low mortgage rates But economists said that seasonal factors make it hard to assess what spur to the economy if any will come from housing in coming months And after a steady retreat mortgage rates seem to be near bottom US housing starts rose 26 pct in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1851 mln units from 1804 mln in January It was the highest pace for starts since April 1986 The rate at which permits were issued for future building climbed 44 pct to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1764 mln units after dropping 1152 pct to 1690 mln in January Februarys weather is usually more adverse for home building Because of seasonal factors its difficult to determine what this means for the economy down the road said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp The housing report is seasonally-weighted to compensate for weather-related setbacks As a result milder temperatures inflate the statistics Economists said that low mortgage rates also were a spur to building last month But several believe that rates will now consolidate before edging up in late springearly summer Builders are looking at current mortgage rates and saying Lets do it now said Mark Obrinsky of the US League of Savings Institutions in Washington whose members supply much of the financing for home building But Obrinsky doubts that there is much more downward potential for rates because he foresees higher inflation and some overall improvement in the US economy He expects rates to gain 50 to 100 basis points in early summer from the 950 pct fixed rate effective in February Last November fixed rate mortgages were about 1030 pct As expected the strength in housing was concentrated in the single-family sector The multi-family area -- which typically represents rental units -- remained weak due to high vacancy rates and increased capital costs of such units following tax law changes effective January 1 Single-family starts rose at a 56 pct annual pace to 1317 mln units Multi-family fell 41 pct to a 534000 rate Strength in the single-family sector indicates that low mortgage rates are doing their job But were probably not looking at a great deal of growth potential said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets McCarthy noted that the housing report together with larger than expected gains in US employment industrial output and retail sales in February may cause some observers to start waving four pct GNP banners for the first quarter Gross national product grew 13 pct in the fourth quarter But McCarthy who still expects first quarter real GNP to come in at an annual rate of 25 pct or slightly above is not convinced that growth will pick up in future The big story is the inventory re-building thats going on now not all of which is intentional he said For example US automakers who are already saddled with high stocks produced at an annual rate of 83 mln units in February compared with domestic car sales of 73 mln Thus while inventories could contribute to GNP in the first quarter they may result in scaled-back production and weaker growth in the second he said If most of the first quarter growth is inventory building and we cannot identify any improvement in export demand then there is the potential for softness in the second quarter agreed Allan Leslie of Discount Corp He is still evaluating first quarter GNP prospects Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker said last week that current data do not show the worsening in trade has reversed At the same time that we are pumping up inventories in the first quarter we could foresee production slowing in the second cautioned Joe Plocek of McCarthy Crisanti and Maffei Inc who expects first quarter growth of about three pct
