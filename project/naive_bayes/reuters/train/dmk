The Indonesian rupiah has held steady
since its 31 pct devaluation against the dollar six months ago,
but has slipped against the mark and to a lesser extent against
the yen, according to central bank figures.
    In the past month, the rupiah has fallen five pct against
the yen. Today's middle rate per 100 yen was 1,129.78 against
1,075.20 at end-February and 1,058.6 at devaluation in
September.
    Bank Indonesia's quoted rate for the dollar, the main
currency for Indonesia's oil and gas exports, was 1,644.0
today, the same rate fixed at the time of devaluation.
    The rate for the West German mark was 913.28 today, a sharp
drop from September when it was 786.06.
    The British pound has risen to 2,657.93 against 2,429.83.
   The value of the rupiah is set daily against a basket of
currencies by the central bank.
    The rise in the value of the mark and the yen has hit
Indonesia by increasing its debt servicing levels. Its total
disbursed foreign debt is estimated by the World Bank at 37
billion dlrs.
    Japan is one of Indonesia's key trading partners, taking
half its oil exports.

The Bundesbank did not intervene as
the dollar was fixed lower at 1.8063 marks after 1.8231 on
Friday, dealers said.
    Business calmed down after a hectic start, with European
operators sidelined because of uncertainty about the short-term
direction of the dollar, dealers said. "At the moment, all the
action is taking place in New York and Tokyo," one said.
    The U.S. Currency traded within a 145 basis point range in
Europe, touching a low of 1.7940 and a high of 1.8085 marks.
But it remained within a narrow 40 basis point span around
1.8050 marks after the first hour of European trading.
    Comments by Japanese officials and Bank of Japan dollar
support had pushed it above 145 yen and 1.80 marks after
falling as low as 144.50 and 1.7860 respectively in Tokyo.

The Bundesbank declined to comment on
rumours in Tokyo that it was intervening heavily to support the
dollar, but dealers here said they had not seen the German
central bank in the market all morning.
    The dollar was quoted at around 1.8040 marks shortly after
midday in nervous but quiet trading, up from its 1.7975/85
opening.
    Spreads against the mark remained around 10 basis points,
with some banks quoting only five point spreads. Dealers said
spreads would widen and the dollar would move more sharply if
the Bundesbank did intervene.
