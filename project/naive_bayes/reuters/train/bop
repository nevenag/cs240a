227	Domestic demand is now expected to make no contribution to Australian economic growth in fiscal 198687 ending June 30 while net exports will account for all of the overall increase Treasurer Paul Keating said here However he did not say in his speech to the Economic Planning Advisory Council EPAC if the forecast 225 pct rise in gross domestic product gdp had been revised But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly this financial year and net export growth will provide the total source of gdp growth The August budget had forecast domestic demand would contribute 075 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 25 pct while net exports would account for 175 points Keating said the overall impact of the changed economic parameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to a slightly more rapid correction in the current account deficit than first anticipated The government initially forecast a current account deficit for 198687 of 1475 billion -- our present expectation is that the result will be somewhat lower around 14 billion he said Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPAC in December indicate that the 198687 budget strategy is broadly on track Keating said They indicate that domestic demand has been a little more sluggish than was expected at budget time he said On the other hand net exports seem to be expanding by more than expected at budget time and this is underpinning growth in domestic production and employment Keating said it now seems likely that the 198687 inflation rate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct Nevertheless there is likely to be a marked slowing in inflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetary effects wane he said Keating said the government expects economic growth to pick up moderately in 198788 due to a further significant rise in net exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from private domestic demand He said domestic demand growth will be due to a strengthening in real household disposable income The moderate rise in economic growth next financial year should be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a level broadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year The current account deficit will continue to show improvement in 198788 Keating said As the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recent years recede further and given continued effective wage restraint inflation should moderate markedly in 198788 he said

1611	Turkey expects a 1986 balance of payments deficit of 15 billion dlrs well over target but is taking steps to improve its performance in this and other fields Ali Tigrel director of economic planning at the State Planning Organisation said He told Reuters the shortfall was a direct consequence of economic growth of nearly eight pct up from 51 pct in 1985 which he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after a drop of more than 12 points to 246 pct in the Treasury wholesale index last year This years target of 20 pct might be attainable but the economic management will have to be careful he said Tigrel whose department produces the annual programme which is central to the governments economic planning said Turkeys creditworthiness was at risk over the current account shortfall originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs We must alleviate the current account substantially to sustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure over the last five years he added His comment echoed last Octobers Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report on Turkey which said Ankaras case for more medium-term financing on better terms would look better if inflation were lower and the current account deficit cut or turned into a surplus In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sector investments we must reduce the public sector deficit as a percentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visible improvement in the current account deficit he said Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year was also to blame for the high deficits Appropriations to government departments had been cut by eight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreign borrowing by municipalities had been restrained We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to the investment programme and do not exceed their appropriations he said It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing requirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated 56 pct in 1986 More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was also targeted Tigrel said Measures were being taken to encourage exports and production incentives were being considered We must try to make sure that more capacity is injected into the Turkish economy in the coming years The promotion policy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and local private capital come more into play as far as manufacturing capacity is concerned Tigrel said He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkish economy to free market policies begun in 1980 was still under way Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate policy applied but he acknowledged there was more to be done in a country where the state still dominates industry and the currency is only partially convertible

3249	The Dutch current account surplus fell 54 billion guilders last year to a provisional 121 billion guilders the Finance Ministry said in a statement The surplus is expected to fall further in 1987 the statement said but gave no details Earlier today the official planning agency CPB said it expected the surplus to fall to six billion guilders during 1987 The visible goods surplus excluding energy fell by 56 billion guilders in 1986 to 114 billion due to declining terms of exchange while more goods were imported as consumer spending and investment increased While the energy trade balance surplus rose by 54 billion guilders 47 billion of this gain was caused by temporary improvements of terms of exchange and was aided by the delay between the fall in oil and gas prices The current account showed a 52 billion guilder deficit on invisibles compared with a balance in 1985 the Finance Ministry said noting the surplus on transport services was reduced substantially due to the lower dollar and oil price falls The fourth quarter current account showed a deficit for the first time since 1980 of 700 mln guilders it said
3338	The dollar will decline over the next two to three years but this is unlikely to result in a complete reduction of the US current account deficit said Anthony Solomon chairman of SG Warburg USA Inc and former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York In a presentation to the Japan Society Solomon said without elaboration that he expects a significant decline in the dollar within the next three years The dollar will fall more but the current account deficit will stop being reduced when it reaches its structural core he said Solomon described the structural core as about one-half of the current 150 billion dlr annual deficit He cited several factors which will prevent an elimination of the deficit For one thing it is unlikely that there will be any new investment in those manufacturing industries that shrank when the dollar was at uncompetitive levels he said In addition he said that the US has an increased propensity to import in order to satisify consumer tastes Solomon forecast inflation at 45 pct by year-end but said it could be kept below five pct in the medium-term if oil prices are stable and commodity values remain low
3488	Chinas foreign debt reached 27 billion dlrs by the end of 1986 but despite an over-exposure to short-term credits and yen borrowing China remains very creditworthy with an improved 1987 export outlook foreign bankers and Chinese officials told Reuters Foreign bankers said Chinas total debt rose sharply from an estimated 20 billion dlrs at end-1985 to cover increased import commitments but the debtequity ratio remains low between eight and 10 pct China remains a cautious and popular borrower they said Zhang Haoruo vice minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade said last Friday that China signed foreign loan agreements for 694 billion dlrs last year 966 pct up on 1985 with actual loans amounting to 483 billion up 93 pct Officials said China would borrow 25 to 30 billion dlrs in the 1986-90 five year plan period but foreign bankers said they estimate foreign loans at 30 to 40 billion A Western banker said Chinas portfolio contains too much short-term debt and too much of it is denominated in yen as a result of aggressive lending by Japanese banks and attractive low interest rates in the Japanese market The strong yen appreciation has cost China dearly and is likely to make it reduce new yen borrowings the banker said A Chinese trade official estimated the yen component of the countrys total debt at about 30 pct The Peking representative of a Japanese securities house said the rapid yen rise had caught China and his firm unawares Interest rates in Japan are at a historical low but China which will remain an active borrower this year is likely to go elsewhere for capital to get a better currency spread he said The Western banker said the excess of short-term loans is in part a result of Chinas inexperience in the foreign capital markets which it entered only in the early 1980s Officials do not think of China but of their own department or firm Some loans that were entered into did not have the full backing of the Peoples Republic of China he said The dilemma for China in foreign borrowing as in other areas is to balance central control with giving reasonable autonomy to firms It is searching for the mechanisms to exercise indirect controls he said The banker said officials have stressed repeatedly over the past six weeks that Chinas foreign borrowing will not be affected by a drive against bourgeois liberalism a phrase meaning Western political ideas following the dismissal of Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang on January 16 A US Banker said there is no evidence that Chinas foreign exchange reserves have fallen below the officially stated figure of 10 billion dlrs The Bank of China is both a buyer and a seller in the market which would know quickly if it was buying heavily in advance of an announcement the reserves were down he said The banker said such buying has not been going on Things are normal Trade deficits such as China had last year and in 1985 are normal for a country at its stage of development Customs figures show China had a trade deficit of 119 billion dlrs in 1986 down from 14 billion in 1985 A Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade official said this years outlook for exports which account for more than 75 pct of foreign exchange earnings is much healthier than a year ago The renminbi has matched the US Dollar fall he said It was quoted at 372 today little changed from 37 a year ago The official said China has taken measures to improve its export performance including incentive offers to exporters and the establishment of export production bases We expect higher prices for our oil exports this year he added Official estimates put Chinas 1986 export losses from the drop in world oil prices at three billion dlrs A Western diplomat said Chinas foreign debt needs careful management but its debt service ratio remains very low at six to eight pct We base our assessment not on Chinas foreign exchange reserves but on its export performance just as you assess a company on its performance not its bank account he said He said China performed very well in the export field last year and remains a very creditworthy country which will have few difficulties in increasing its borrowing

5189	Australias current account deficit for February is expected to narrow to a range of between 700 mln and one billion dlrs from the unrevised January level of 129 billion market economists polled by Reuters said Statistics Bureau February figures are out tomorrow The economists said a key element in the narrowing would be a reversal of the drop in exports which took place in January after a sharp rise in December when the deficit was only 598 mln dlrs As an example they quoted wheat export volume which rose about 30 pct in February after dropping as much in January A lack of aircraft imports in February should also contribute on the trade account although it is still likely to remain in deficit the economists said Other positive influences on the current account balance should be a decline in the invisibles deficit following a seasonal fall in interest payments and the dropping out of certain official aid payments they said They said the Australian dollar which last week touched an eight-month high of 06900 US Dlrs but is now around the 06800 level should not react adversely to the figures unless the current account shortfall tops one billion dlrs

6037	Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson presenting his budget for fiscal 198788 to parliament said UK Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar 1987 He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of payments deficit in 1987 of 25 billion stg after a 11 billion shortfall in 1986 Inflation is expected to be 40 pct at the end of 1987 he said adding it may exceed 45 pct by the summer before falling back to 40 pct by the end of the year The planned PSBR for 198788 was 40 billion stg unchanged when compared with the likely outturn for fiscal 198687 Lawson said Although no explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3 money supply Lawson said broad money will continue to be taken into account in assessing monetary conditions as well as the exchange rate The low outturn of the PSBR in 198687 was mainly due to the buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general and the corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business sector in particular On oil prices Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per barrel in calendar 1987 The treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at 10 pct of GDP in future he said
6156	Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawsons Budget speech was described as sound and well balanced by analysts if slightly lacking in excitement A cut in bank base lending rates is now widely expected tomorrow with most forecasts predicting a half-point fall A follow-up half-point cut is anticipated next week Worthy but boring would probably sum it up Peter Fellner UK Economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co said It was a very very prudent fiscal budget Richard Jeffrey of brokers Hoare Govett said it was a well-balanced budget within the confines of the governments philosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat Most analysts said the Budget was very sound on the fiscal side but offered nothing new on monetary policy As was widely expected Lawson split his fiscal adjustment between trimming the 198788 PSBR target to 40 billion stg from 71 billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to 27 pct The target for the narrow measure of money supply M0 was kept unchangd at two to six pct while the target for the broad Sterling M3 aggregate was dropped Both Jeffrey and Fellner said the budget clears the way for a half-point fall in UK Base rates tomorrow but the authorities are unlikely to sanction a larger cut immediately Many analysts and currency dealers have forecast a full one-point cut tomorrow The Bank of England will be loathe to take any action which it will have to reverse later Jeffrey said though he added a further half-point cut was quite possible in the near future The main worry from todays speech is the outlook for inflation given the signs of relaxed monetary policy contained in it Scrimgeour Vickers economist Richard Holt said Holt noted the rather loose inflation forecast of 40 pct at end-1987 and said the lower interest rates likely to result from the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term he said although lower mortgage interest rates on the back of falling base rates would have an offsetting impact on inflation The Budget will inspire a lot of short-term confidence but it was not a good budget for inflation he said Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more about the dangers of excessive liquidity build-up but overall was not too concerned about a revival of inflation Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the leading edge of monetary policy but said the authorities were likely to be extremely cautious on this front He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interest rates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed any signs of excessive weakness Most analysts agreed Lawson had bolstered the credibility of the Budget by adopting realistic forecasts Raising the forecast for the current account deficit from 15 to 25 billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets which are already discounting that amount Jeffrey said that the 40 billion stg PSBR target was given credibility by the favourable outturn for 198687 which is now also forecast to be 40 billion stg But analysts said the Budget speech did not give any clear-cut indication about the timing of the general election which has to be held before June 1988 Some believe it signals a poll this June noting that the benefits such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raise duties on alcohol and tobacco become available immediately But others said it kept several options open and it was not possible to deduce too much from it James Capels Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent Lawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election in that there would be no chickens coming home to roost Richard Jeffrey who favours the likelihood of a June election said it was important the Chancellor had not gone for a Budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory Nevertheless he said it was likely to result in a boost to the Conservative Partys pre-election popularity
