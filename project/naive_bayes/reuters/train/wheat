180	The US Agriculture Department is not actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union under the export enhancement program EEP senior USDA officials said However grain trade analysts said the proposal has not been ruled out and that an offer might be made though not in the very near future The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said But there just isnt much talk about it informally or formally Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the Soviets even though US officials did not make such an offer when they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlier this week But administration and private sources agreed that if the Reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to Moscow it could take several months I just dont see any proposal like that sailing through any interagency process the aide to Lyng said An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight said one former USDA official who noted that the administration took three months to decide in favor of selling China wheat under the subsidy program An official representing a large grain trade company said deliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members of Congress a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheat subsidy offer to the Soviets But Lyngs aide said that during a day-long visit to Capitol Hill yesterday House members did not press the secretary on the subsidy question a single time The administrations interagency trade policy review group comprised of subcabinet-level officials has not been asked to clear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP officials at the US Trade Representatives Office said In their talks this week the two sides discussed the administrations previous EEP offer but did not talk about any new initiative One USDA official who took part in the consultations this week described them as an exchange of calm basic factual economics Another USDA official said there was not even an informal suggestion or hint that the Soviets would live up to their pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were granted more favorable terms USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an EEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be delayed because of disarray within the White House stemming from the Iran arms affair
235	Indonesias agriculture sector will grow by just 10 pct in calendar 1987 against an estimated 24 pct in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or declines the US Embassy said in a report Production of Indonesias staple food rice is forecast to fall to around 263 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 2658 mln tonnes in 1986 according to the annual report on Indonesias agricultural performance The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 267 mln tonnes with a forecast 273 mln tonnes output in 1987 The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 15 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 169 mln tonnes in 1986 because of a drawdown on stocks Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane rubber and copra show little or no gain the report says The modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans palm oil and palm kernels Constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds limited fertile land insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops the report underlines The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as wereng or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties and to use lower-yielding more resistant rice types The government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee tea rubber plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 70 pct in 1987 to 145 mln tonnes from 135 mln with exports rising to an estimated 720000 tonnes from 695000 tonnes in 1986 the report says But while production of soybeans in 198788 Oct-Sept will rise to 1075 mln tonnes from 980000 in 198687 imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant The report says that imports of wheat soybeans soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last Septembers 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand The report said that Indonesias overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s It compares with 19 pct growth in 1985 and 67 pct in 1984 The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump

742	All major grain producing countries must do their part to help reduce global surpluses and the recent Australian farm policy proposals are flawed two US wheat organizations said The recent Australian proposals were a good starting point for discussions but we do not want the Australians to feel they are alone in developing an agenda for discussions on world grain trade the president of the National Association of Wheat Growers NAWG and the chairman of US Wheat Associates said in a letter to US Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter Future discussions on international wheat trade should include three topics -- a commitment to privatization of government-run export trading entities a commitment to public disclosure of sales and other terms if government entities are involved and a recognition that supply reductions by the US have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be the two organizations said While the Australian proposals are welcome the two organizations said they are not in total agreement with their assessments Australias proposals which aim to reduce US target prices and quarantine US wheat stocks would continue to place the burden of supply adjustment and reform on US farmers they said Other countries including Australia have benefitted from the higher world prices that have resulted from past US acreage and crop reduction programs the organizations said We will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- and subsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stocking grain and changing programs which protect our growers Jim Miller president of NAWG said We sincerely hope for some type of agreement among the worlds major grain producing nations to reduce stocks and restore profitability to agriculture Miller said
856	Grain trade representatives continued to speculate that the Reagan administration will offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union while US Agriculture Department officials said there was no substance to the reports Its pure fiction said one senior official at USDAs Foreign Agricultural Service referring to the rumor that the administration would make an export enhancement offer to Moscow in the next two to three weeks An aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who asked not to be identified said there was nothing to substantiate the speculation which he said was started by somebody fanning the wheat market Wheat futures strengthened today partly on the basis of the speculation One lobbyist with close connections to the Reagan administration said a Soviet trade team told private grain trade officials in New York last week that Moscow would buy as much as four mln tonnes of US wheat much of it before mid-year if it was competitively priced Alexander Ivlev an official with Amtorg a Soviet trading organization told Reuters he had no information to substantiate the rumors of an imminent wheat subsidy offer but said that Moscow would consider buying US wheat if it was competitively priced We dont care if it is EEP what we the Soviets are looking for is competitive prices Ivlev said If they the administration are interested in selling it wheat they should find ways to do it
874	The governments industry aid and protection review body the Industries Assistance Commission IAC will hold a 12-month inquiry into the Australian wheat industry Primary Industry Minister John Kerin said The IAC has been asked to report on the need for assistance to the industry and the nature duration and extent of any aid he said in a statement He said the inquiry will be the first step in setting marketing arrangements to apply after June 30 1989 when the underwriting and pricing provisions of the 1984 Wheat Marketing Act expire Kerin said the broad-ranging reference would allow a full examination of all aspects of the wheat-marketing system The inquiry will be required to take into account changes which have taken place in the industry as a result of the agricultural policies of major wheat producing countries and the industrys capacity to adjust to any recommended changes he said The inquiry is at an important time for the wheat industry as the substantial fall in world prices is likely to trigger underwriting support from the government for the first time he said Kerin was referring to the governments underwriting of the guaranteed minimum price paid to wheatgrowers by the Australian Wheat Board near the start of the season The IACs report will be due at the same time as the findings of the current Royal Commission into Grain Storage Handling and Transport Kerin said He said the timing of the IAC inquiry would allow its findings and those of the Royal Commission to be considered in later negotiations on wheat-marketing arrangements between the federal and state governments and the industry

1377	The Australian Government will likely reimburse the Australian Wheat Board AWB about 132 mln US dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 198687 crop the US Agriculture Department said In its report on Export Markets for US Grains the department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has reduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at around 98 dlrs per tonne For example the recent large sales of wheat to China 15 mln tonnes and Egypt 20 mln tonnes were well below the breakeven export price it said Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price GMP calculated at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current year and the two lowest of the previous three years the department said In addition deductions for taxes freight handling and storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives But the department said the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Economics BAE predicts wheat production will drop sharply from 178 mln tonnes in 198687 to 135 mln in 198990 The decline will result from low world grain prices leading to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit US wheat exports the department said

1405	Chicago Board of trade grain traders and analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to handle their upcoming spring plantings prompting sales of new crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans in the futures markets Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because corn is protected by the acreage reduction program That gives deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they sign-up for reduced acreage but they have no price guarantees With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing rather than gamble on soybeans even though the new crop soybeancorn ratio of 291 would make planting soybeans more attractive under normal circumstances An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln more oat acres this year than last without being penalized traders said Here too acres some farmers may have been thinking of shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats due to the more attractive deal from the government they added Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six months ago which should prompt many farmers in the South to put soybean land back into cotton One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans which are easier to grow one commercial trader said
1570	Polands winter wheat is likely to survive recent frosts but the impact of the cold will not be known until late April the Polish meteorology institute said Some varieties of winter wheat sown in Poland can survive ground temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees C Spokesman Teresa Tomaszewska told Reuters Even though an earlier thin protective layer of snow mainly melted in February air temperatures down to minus 30 C should not be harmful she said but added that wheat can still be damaged by cold spells in March and April when young shoots may be exposed to night frosts
1590	Sen Rudy Boschwitz R-Minn said he intended to offer legislation that would allow 1987 producers of wheat feedgrains cotton and rice to receive at least 92 pct of their deficiency payments regardless of how much they planted Boschwitz told the Senate Agriculture Committee that applying the so-called 092 provision to 1987 crops was supported by the Reagan administration and would save approximately 500 mln dlrs including 266 mln dlrs in corn payments 90 mln dlrs in wheat and 30 mln dlrs in cotton The Minnesota senator said he might offer the bill on the Senate floor or in a conference committee with the House of Representatives in the event a similar bill before the House Agriculture Committee is approved by that body Boschwitz told Reuters that neither he nor the US Agriculture Department had decided whether or how deficiency payments should be guaranteed to farmers who might choose not to plant under the decoupling scheme If payments are not set in advance under decoupling market prices conceivably could rise thereby leading to diminished deficiency payments Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy D-Vt said he wanted to go to conference with the House as soon as possible on the issue but would have to study the matter further before deciding how he would vote on it

10569	A cold air mass working its way south from Canada may pose a threat to developing hard red winter wheat in Oklahoma according to Eugene Krenzler wheat specialist for the Oklahoma Cooperative Extension There is some threat Some of the crop is far enough along so that its probably vulnerable Krenzler said Accu Weather meteorologist Dale Mohler said cold air moving from the north could put temperatures in the middle 20s fahrenheit as early as tonight depending on development of a low pressure area over southeast Colorado which could stall the system If impeded by the low-pressure area the cold air could hit Oklahoma and Texas as late as Monday morning Temperatures could stay in the mid-20s for up to eight hours Mohler said Krenzler said less than 10 pct of the Oklahoma wheat crop has advanced to boot stage The closer to that stage the more vulnerable the head of the wheat is to cold weather he said We can handle probably an hour or so down to 25 or 26 degrees fahrenheit Krenzler said as long as we dont have a lot of wind If we do get six hours down below 25 degrees Id say we have a good chance of significant damage to the heads he said Krenzler said early planted stands in the north-central and southwestern parts of the state are probably most vulnerable Crops in the panhandle of Oklahoma and Texas are less developed and have some snow cover protection from the cold he noted
10830	Sri Lanka has appealed to 24 countries for emergency aid to help 24 mln villagers affected by the countrys worst drought in 36 years government officials said Embassies received letters over the weekend outlining aid needed for a sixth of Sri Lankas population in 13 districts The letter said the government had to step in to avert serious economic hardship and because the Social Services Ministry had already used up its entire 1987 budget provision of 23 mln rupees by distributing help to the worst hit areas The letter said 54876 mln rupees were needed for a six month period at least until the May-September Yala rice crop was harvested Over 25000 tonnes of wheat rice flour and other cereals were required it said along with supplies of sugar lentils dried or canned fish and milk In some of the most seriously affected districts the Maha October 1986-April 1987 crop had been almost completely devastated the letter said Maha paddy output was now estimated at 70 mln bushels 20 mln less than originally expected There were two scenarios for the Yala crop with a high forecast of around 40 mln bushels conditional on adequate rainfall within the next three to four weeks Should the present drought continue however production is estimated at around 20 mln bushels the letter added Total estimated paddy output for 1987 would be between 90 and 110 mln bushels or 135 to 165 mln tonnes of rice Last years output was 124 mln bushels down from 127 mln in 1985 The letter said villagers in most seriously affected districts had been deprived of any means of subsistence because subsidiary crops had also failed It said the governments current budget did not permit it to provide sustained and adequate relief to those affected Revenue has been adversely affected by depressed commodity prices and slowing of the economy Defence commitments continue to exert pressure on the expenditure side The 54876 mln cash would cover payments of 150 rupees per month for each family as well as handling transport and distribution of emergency food But such an outlay of funds by the government would not be possible without seriously impairing development projects or greatly fuelling inflation in the economy the letter said The letter said the Food Department would be able to release wheat and rice from the buffer stock to meet the immediate cereal requirements provided such stocks are replaced subsequently The Meteorological Department said the country was experiencing its worst drought since 1951 and the four-month dry spell prevailing in most of the areas would only break when the monsoon rains fell in late May The letter said some areas had been experiencing the drought since August and in the rice growing district of Kurunegala there had been no effective rainfall since June 1986

11224	Consuming countries chastened by the collapse of International Tin Council ITC price support operations in 1985 are insisting more than ever before that commodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they are serving a Reuter survey showed They want price ranges to be more responsive to market trends - to avoid overstimulating output and straining the accords support operations - and intervention rules that avoid the risk of exports by non-members undermining the pacts Consumers and producers mindful of ITC buffer stock losses have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned a generalised approach to commodity price stabilisation and prefer to assess each commodity case by case the survey showed The International Cocoa Organization ICCO last week set precise limits on what the Buffer Stock Manager BSM could do under the new agreement It imposed daily and weekly purchase limits prohibited the BSM from operating on futures markets and stipulated after consumer insistence that up to 15 pct of total buffer stock purchases could be of non-member cocoa This will help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia the worlds fourth largest producer undermining the market The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the Buffer Stock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades A new International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA was adopted earlier this month in Geneva Importing and exporting countries agreed several changes to make the reference price more responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions under which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance operations Direct cash contributions from members will fund buffer stock purchases Bank financing was a particular feature of the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling Legal wrangles continue Recent International Coffee Organization ICO negotiations in London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that agreements reflect market reality commodity analysts said Consumers and a small group of producers argued that objective criteria should be used to define export quota shares which would have meant a reduction in the share of Brazil the worlds leading producer Brazil wanted to maintain its previous quota share of 30 pct The talks broke down and although an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term negotiations on export quota distribution as remote International agreements exist for sugar and wheat These do not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for discussions on possible future economic agreements collect statistics and draw up market analyses Analysts said differences between sugar exporting countries have held up any progress towards an accord with economic teeth while sheer competition between major exporters amid a world grain glut militate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat An alternative focus for commodity discussions are international study groups made up of governments with advice from industry such as those for lead and zinc and rubber The UN Common fund for commodities with a planned directly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs has failed to become operational because neither the US Nor the Soviet Union has ratified it US Officials in Washington said the US Doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives citing the lack of widespread support US Officials in Washington and Malaysian officials in Kuala Lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commodity pact case by case US Officials said it has been willing to study individual cases for economically sound market-oriented commodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests We see little to be gained by attempting to increase the price of a commodity whose long-term trend is downward official Administration policy states The US Currently belongs to only two international commodity agreements that have economic clauses - the International Coffee Agreement ICA and INRA - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat pacts The US Did not join the International Cocoa Agreement because it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and not designed to protect the interests of consuming countries the State Department said US Officials singled out the INRA as the one commodity agreement that seems to be working US Negotiators were successful in getting other members of the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment mechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect market trends and also to continue the accord as a market oriented agreement US Officials said Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they have consistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts on the merits of each case Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur his country the worlds top producer of rubber tin and palm oil decides its participation in international commodity pacts case by case Malaysia is a member of the Association of Tin Producing Countries ATPC which produce 65 pct of world tin The ATPC launched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96000 tonnes for a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50000 from 70000 Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture and delegate to cocoa wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron told Reuters in London Agreements with economic clauses to stabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were close to market reality if there was full participation by producers and consumers and if participants were prepared to take their obligations in the framework of the agreement seriously But Baron added No real sanctions are available for a country that doesnt stick to its obligationsThe German approach is sceptical We dont think agreements are the best instrument to help developing countries They were never meant to be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how developing countries often interpret them Traditionally Britain has always been supportive of commodity agreements reflecting its strong links with Third World producing countries But recently demands for more stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the need for intellectual honesty and objective criteria have grown British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree of transparency and do not contain the risk of open-ended borrowing that occurred in the tin pact they said UK Delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to reflect changes in market structure and price trends rather than dictate what prices should be A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges price realism in commodity pacts adding high prices inflate supply A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourable to commodity pacts France a large consumer and producer of sugar favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real market situation particularly regarding stocks Indonesias Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja told Reuters in Jakarta These agreements can work as long as the problems are cyclicalBut its another matter when there are structural problemsBut we are still committed to commodity agreements as an act of faith Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producers cannot afford not to give their backing to commodity agreements The political will is not there on the part of some consumers to make agreements work Martinez Cuenca said The head of the economics department in the Brazilian Foreign Ministry Sebastiao do Rego Barros told Reuters an agreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market reality If you have an agreement such as coffee with a system of quotas with a link between prices practised inside the pact and actual market prices it can work UNCTAD spokesman Graham Shanley said consuming countries realise steady export earnings enhance developing countries ability to service debt and mean greater demand for industrialised nations capital goods

12002	Speculation the United States will offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to have reached a new level of intensity in the run-up to Secretary of State George Shultz visit later this month to Moscow Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheat markets since officials from the two countries held their customary semi-annual grain talks in February Moscows decision at that time to reenter the US corn market strengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13 Shultz statement two weeks ago that he would not stand in the way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export Enhancement Program EEP coupled with the announcement of his visit to Moscow was interpreted by many grain trade representatives here as a clear signal that the Reagan administration was preparing an offer Administration officials -- in and out of the US Agriculture Department -- have been extremely tight-lipped about the prospects of a subsidy offer But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned the contention the proposal is dormant suggesting that an offer while not a done deal is a live possibility Prominent US grain trade representatives -- many of whom asked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that an offer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent Others who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible are saying they would not rule one out Rep Pat Roberts R-Kan yesterday went so far as to predict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days to two weeks Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaders who had been in contact with administration officials Richard Fritz director of international marketing at US Wheat Associates said he was confident an export enhancement offer would be made by the middle of this month Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end up being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier this year when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrs per tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat Some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheat subsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases of US corn and open the door to US sales of soybeans As ever one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat deal would appear to be price Last summer the administration took the controversial step of offering the Soviets subsidized wheat -- but were embarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds that the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left US wheat prices far above world market prices The administrations decision to set the subsidy level up front instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be a means of controlling the price while attempting to dampen criticism grain trade sources said Nonetheless the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultz from saying the Soviets were chortling because Washington was offering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available to US housewives The conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives here is that a general warming of relations between the two countries since last summer combined with continued hard times in the US grain belt would favor a subsidy offer In addition the USSR has made it clear it would consider buying US wheat if it were priced more competitively However observers have not forgotten the circumstances surrounding the administrations announcement of the wheat subsidy offer last summer Up until the time of the announcment congressional and industry leaders were led to believe the White House had decided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include not only the Soviets but also a much broader list of countries Instead the administration scaled back the offer to include only the Soviets That last-minute change of heart adds a measure of uncertainty even to the predictions of those most convinced that the administration will not now pass up the opportunity to sell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union

12261	The Soviet Union would likely be more interested in purchasing new crop wheat than in booking any grain for immediate shipment if offered a subsidy on US wheat an executive with a major grain export company said Lower prices and the desire to delay any big purchases until the condition of winter and spring crops is better known make new crop wheat more attractive said George Hoffman director of commodity analysis for The Pillsbury Company Pillsbury is assuming that they Soviets will be offered a subsidy and that it will be a subsidy that they can respond to Hoffman told Reuters in an interview at an agribusiness education conference here But if there are too many constraints placed on a subsidy offer the USSR will take less than an anticipated four mln tonnes he said Hoffman said Pillsburys internal statistics put Soviet Union wheat purchases at only two mln tonnes under a subsidy offer However if a subsidy is offered at competitive levels Moscow would likely buy more he said If we give the Soviets the same deal as the Chinese I expect theyll take it said Vernon McMinimy director of commodity research for AE Staley Manufacturing Co McMinimy told Reuters spring weather and its impact on crops will determine how much wheat Moscow would buy under a subsidy offer Soviet winter crops did not get off to a good start because of a dry autumn last year and because of the severe winter they probably have had more damage due to winter weather than normal McMinimy said

12420	Australia is risking wheat export sales by not providing enough specific quality grades to meet buyer requirements the Australian Wheat Board AWB said Many AWB customers are becoming increasingly quality conscious demanding strict adherence to contractual quality specifications the board said in a submission to the Royal Commission into Grain Storage Handling and Transport Many of the specifications are more specific than the current categories used in Australia it said The commission is trying to identify ways of saving costs and boosting efficiency of the grain handling system Australia must rely on quality to retain its wheat market share because its competitors are supplying cheaper but lower-quality grades the AWB submission said It stressed the need to segregate wheat categories at every stage from receival to shipping Better industrial relations at grain terminals more uniform transport systems across the states and extensive stock control were vital to improved marketing it said The submission also said Australias federal system impeded the AWBs role of coordinating and managing the marketing of wheat The AWB called for an end to physical and legislative constraints at state borders that prevent the efficient transport of grains to other states for shipment It is essential that wheat moves by the most economic mode to the nearest efficient port irrespective of the state in which the wheat is grown or stored it said For example wheat grown in northern New South Wales NSW might move more efficiently to Brisbane in Queensland than to Sydney or Newcastle in New South Wales it said Similarly southern NSW wheat might better be shipped to Portland or Geelong in Victoria Legislation giving state rail authorities a monopoly over grain shipments was one notable impediment it said The AWB said the current approach of state-based bulk handling authorities is not essential although it said it favoured the authorities maintaining at least their current level of control of storage and transport as long as quality was maintained An appendix on port loading costs showed it cost between 26500 and 34700 US Dlrs to load a 50000-tonne vessel at various Australian ports compared with 21200 dlrs at Houston and 16300 at Port Cartier Quebec for a 60000-tonner

12887	Pakistan is not emerging as a major wheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough Sartaj Aziz Special Assistant on Food and Agriculture to the Pakistani Prime Minister said in an interview No exports are planned for the next 12 months or so and plans last year to sell one mln tonnes to Iran came to nothing because they could not agree a price he said Aziz forecast that Pakistan may have exportable surpluses of one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next few harvests in years when the weather is favourable The government does not wish to increase output much above this because of low world prices and the land would be better used for other crops Aziz said the Pakistani government does not want area sown to wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares Some 10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched to more profitable crops such as oilseeds The aim is to concentrate on raising yields from the current 18 to 19 tonnes per ha to at least 25 tonnes per ha over the next five to seven years he said Aziz said the current 198687 crop harvesting of which is just beginning is expected to yield around a record 145 mln tonnes This compares with a target of 147 mln and last years yield of 140 mln He said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but more recent rains reduced prospects slightly The long-term wheat production target is for some 17 mln tonnes by mid-1993 taking into account Pakistans annual population growth rate of more than three pct Current consumption is some 125 mln tonnes The current wheat reserve is 25 mln tonnes Aziz said This compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mln tonnes which Pakistan will maintain at all costs and a strategic reserve target of two mln tonnes Despite the fact that stocks are a half-mln tonnes over target the surplus will not be exported at present he said The government wants to keep an extra safety margin until it sees what effect the abolition of a 44-year-old wheat rationing system will have on domestic consumption New exports will be considered only in about a years time when the 198788 crop can be gauged as well he said The new domestic policy introduced on March 15 is for the government to supply unlimited quantities of wheat at two rupees per kilo With other costs this means a price in Pakistani markets of between 230 and 250 rupees per kilo Under the old system introduced during World War Two and due to be phased out by April 15 some 50 mln ration cards were issued enabling poor people to buy wheat cheaply Aziz said following the introduction of a government support price in the 1970s the system become so corrupted that only 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching the consumer the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills The ration system had also not had the stabilising effect on the internal wheat market that was intended Aziz said Prices have already begun to fall with the introduction of the new system The wheat price in Karachi the most expensive Pakistani city had dropped from 311 rupees per kilo on March 1 to 285 rupees on March 30 Aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have a major effect on total consumption but it may encourage better use of side-products such as bran

2367	A House Agriculture Committee meeting later today to draft a disaster aid bill is expected to spark a debate between lawmakers who want to expand the 092 or de-coupling provision to cover feedgrains and those who oppose 092 or want it severely limited Congressional sources said The disaster aid bill as it now stands calls for a one-year 092 pilot program for 1987 crop wheat and the 1988 winter wheat crop The bill would allow farmers to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments The administration has strongly urged that the bill be expanded to feedgrains and to more than one year It is difficult to tell in what form the 092 provision will emerge from the committee the sources said Proponents of an expansion of 092 maintain there are large estimated cost savings of such a bill -- ranging from estimates by the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at this time is the major reason cited by those against an expansion of the bill committee staffers said The 092 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST A conflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting and staffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an expanded 092 program since spring planting in many areas of the country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup for the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30 Farmers are now making their planting decisions so something has to be done quickly if a 092 program is to be implemented an Agriculture Department source said An expansion of 092 to feedgrains was opposed in last weeks subcommittee hearing on the bill with subcommittee chairman Dan Glickman D-Kan saying that more study of the consequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was necessary Major commodity groups including the National Corn Growers the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemens Association have voiced strong opposition to 092 But proponents of an expanded 092 argue that the bill currently is not equitable for all grains producers so it should be extended to other crops There will be difficulty in limiting 092 to wheat said Gene Moos aide to house majority leader Tom Foley D-Wash Projected cost savings in the current atmosphere of try to decrease farm expenditures would also be hard to ignore in the debate to expand the 092 application Moos said Rep Charles Stenholm D-Tex may be planning to introduce a bill to restrict 092 to only 1987 crop wheat with the argument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any major changes in the farm bill Stenholms bill is not a rejection of 092 only of the timing a congressional staff member said Rep Arland Stangeland R-Minn is reported to have an amendment to expand the 092 provision to 1987 and 1988 feedgrains

2508	Key members of the House Agriculture committee have agreed to scale-back the 092 provision of a pending disaster aid bill to cover only 1987 crop wheat but a broader 092 proposal is likely to be resurrected later Congressional sources said The sources said key lawmakers including Reps Glenn English D-Okla and Dan Glickman D-Kan agreed to support an amendment to be offered next week by Rep Charles Stenholm D-Tex which would limit 092 only to producers of 1987 crop winter and spring wheat This would scale-back the 092 provision to the original proposal by English allowing a pilot 092 program for 1987 wheat only That provision was later broadened by the subcommittee to include 1988 crop winter wheat Under 092 a farmer can forego planting a crop but still collect 92 pct of deficiency payments Earlier today the House Agriculture committee postponed until next Tuesday a meeting to consider the disaster aid bill and 092 The agreement to limit 092 to a wheat pilot program follows vocal criticism of the proposal by some influential farm groups who are concerned about the major impact of 092 and by members of Congress wary of reopening the farm bill Congressional sources said there has not been enough time to study the implications of a broad 092 The timing of the proposal is off said one aide to a House Agriculture committee member However several Congressional sources said they expect a broader 092 provision to emerge again when the House Agriculture committee is faced next month with the need to make spending cuts in the agriculture budget for fiscal 1988 as part of an overall deficit reduction package Gene Moos aide to House Majority leader Tom Foley D-Wash predicted agricultures share of budget cuts may exceed one billion dlrs A broader 092 might be resurrected later because both the Congressional Budget Office and the Reagan administration estimate it would result in significant budget savings A US Agriculture Department official said 092 for all 1987 crops would save 300 to 400 mln dlrs and more than 15 billion dlrs over five years Another factor which could affect the 092 debate is the approach of planting season Congressional sources said Some officials said it already is late for implementation of a 092 in 1987 because farm program signup ends March 31 for wheat and feedgrains If Congress approved 092 later in the year sign-up either would have to be extended or reopened sources said

2741	The US National Association of Wheat Growers NAWG urged the Reagan administration offer the Soviet Union wheat under the export enhancement program eep In a letter to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng NAWG stated its strong support for an eep offer to Moscow We believe that a solid case continues to exist for Soviet EEP eligibility and the recently announced and reported Soviet purchases of US corn indicate a Soviet willingness to purchase US grain if it is competitively priced NAWG said Consequently we believe it is important to renew the US eep offer and do all that is reasonably possible to ensure mutual adherence to the terms of the US-Soviet grain agreement the letter said
2747	The Reagan administration continues to debate whether to offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union but would need assurances from the Soviets that they would buy the wheat before the subsidy offer would be made a senior US Agriculture Department official said I think it still is under active debate whether or not it would be advisable to make an the export enhancement offer to the Soviets Thomas Kay administrator of the departments Foreign Agriculture Service told Reuters Wed need some assurances from them the Soviets that they would buy if offered the wheat under the subsidy plan he said Kay called reports that such an offer was imminent premature The Reagan administrations cabinet-level Economic Policy Council is set to meet today to discuss among other matters agricultural policy but is not expected to address a wheat subsidy offer to the Soviet Union administration officials said earlier

2864	Advocates of a 092 plan for feedgrains will likely delay offering their proposals if a disaster aid bill before the House Agriculture Committee is scaled back to include only 1987 winter wheat congressional sources said The disaster aid bill introduced by Rep Glenn English D-Okla sparked sharp controversy with its proposals to implement a 092 program for 1987 wheat and 1988 winter wheat An agreement has been reached to trim the bill back to 1987 wheat but supporters of a 092 feedgrains plan said even that scaled-down version would not be equitable for farmers Unless the English bill pertains only to 1987 winter wheat it is more than a simple disaster payment and feedgrains should be treated equally they said If the bill is narrowed to just winter wheat then supporters of a 092 feedgrains amendment will probably not offer their proposals next week sources said English has agreed to support an amendment by Rep Charles Stenholm R-Tex to narrow the bill to 1987 wheat only but whether he would also back a further reduction is unclear Agricultural aides to English said the congressmans first choice is to make the option available to all 1987 wheat farmers However if the political reality is that disaster aid for winter wheat farmers would be unavailable because of controversy over spring wheat then English might consider an even greater cutback in the bill they said Under a 092 plan farmers could forego planting and still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments Rep Arlan Stangeland R-Minn and Harold Volkmer D-Mo have both expressed interest in expanding the English bill to include a 092 program for feedgrains An aide said Stangeland does not want to reopen the farm bill but to be fair to all crops Only a small percentage of spring wheat farmers would likely sign up for 092 since the incentives to plant are greater than to idle the land economists said Opponents to a 092 feedgrains program argue it is premature to make major changes in the farm bill and that the House Agriculture Committee needs to study more closely the impacts of such a program

3401	Grain analysts said the increase of three mln tonnes in 198687 Soviet grain imports is unlikely to affect the market Tuesday They said the market already has discounted higher Soviet imports partly on news last month that the Soviet Union bought one mln tonnes of US corn and on rumors that the Reagan administration is pushing for authority to sell the Soviets US wheat under the Export Enhancement Program In its supply-demand report the USDA raised its estimate for 198687 Soviet grain imports to 26 mln tonnes from 23 mln That was business already done for all practical purposes said Drexel Burnham analyst Dale Gustafson reflecting similar statements made by other analysts

4490	Implementation of a one-year 092 pilot program for wheat and feedgrains was strongly promoted today by the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee as a way to cut farm costs and simultaneously give farmers another option when making their planting decisions We have a budget driven farm policy It may be a shame but we are locked into this said Dan Glickman D-Kans chairman of the subcommittee on wheat soybeans and feed grains We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt the farmer A 092 plan if properly done could do both Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 092 bill for 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains An aide to Glickman said that it will probably be introduced next week Glickman said a 092 program which allows a farmer to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency payment would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill --only an extension of the 5092 option already provided under the current bill It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill he said but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet budget goals a voluntary 092 plan would be better than sharply cutting target prices as USDA has proposed A 092 plan however would not be decoupling but simply a different type of acreage diversion program Glickman said Decoupling -- delinking planting decisions from government payments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at this point he said I dont think there is any interest in pursuing a decoupling bill this year Period Unequivocal Glickman said at the hearing Sen Rudy Boschwitz R-Minn cosponsor of the BorenBoschwitz decoupling plan said he supports a short term 092 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan Boschwitz plans to introduce a 092 plan in the senate His plan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment to participating farmers require that idled acreage be put to conservation use only prohibit haying and grazing on extra idled acreage limit participation to a certain number of acres in a county and provide tenant protection provisions I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987 but we can at least move in that direction Boschwitz said Robbin Johnson vice president of Cargill Inc testified in favor of decoupling Decoupling would end the current bias in US farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers dependency on the government he said A 092 plan does not go far enough in decoupling Johnson said and would still encourage farmers to plant Officials from the National Corn Growers Association and the National Cattlemens Association said their groups oppose any 092 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening the farm bill and creating more confusion among farmers But when asked if his association were forced to choose between a ten pct cut in target prices or a 092 program Larry Johnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 092 rather than take sharp cuts in target levels
4549	A marketing loan for US wheat feedgrains and soybeans would do nothing to help the surplus production situation and would be extremely costly Sen Rudy Boschwitz R-Minn said I think I would not support a marketing loan now he told the House agriculture subcommittee on wheat soybeans and feedgrains Boschwitz was one of the original supporters of a marketing loan for cotton and rice but has since focused support on decoupling legislation the BorenBoschwitiz bill A market loan for grains and soybeans would encourage more production especially in high-yielding areas would be much more expensive than the current cotton and rice marketing loans and not increase exports significantly he said

5467	A 092 program would have very little impact on US acreage prompting farmers to idle only an additional 35 mln acres of cropland every year according to a report from the Agriculture Department The savings resulting from the additional 35 mln acres idled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings 35 mln dlrs in transportation and storage savings and 10-20 mln dlrs per year in deficiency payment savings the report said The USDA report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 092 acreage program for wheat corn cotton sorghum and barley Last year almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested The likelihood that the 0-92 provisiion will cause very large acreages to be removed from crop production is quite small the report said The returns on typical farms still favor participation in the usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permitted acreage the USDA report said The 092 program which would allow farmers to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment would be most used by producers in high productionhigh risk areas where cost of production is high said Keith Collins director of USDAs economics analysis staff In the heart of the corn belt you would not get that much participation Collins said USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheat would be ildled under 092 15 mln acres of corn 500000 acres of sorghum and barley and 500000 acres of cotton Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40 mln bushels of wheat 180 mln bushels of corn 20 mln bushels of sorghum 10 mln bushels of barley and 500000 bales of cotton the report said In determining whether to participate a producer would need to weigh the expected cash costs of production against the loan rate  The risk that market prices may rise above the expected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must be considered according to the analysis What youre giving up under 092 is the difference between the loan rate and the cost of production Collins said For producers with low production costs that difference is greater and can be applied to paying variable costs he said Under these cicumstances farmers would not want to go along with 092 But for high cost producers 092 would be more attractive Also as loan rates get lower Collins said there would be more incentives to participate in a 092 program I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal at first but it is a step towards the goal of separating production decisions from government payments Collins said In a speech earlier today before the National Grains and Feed Association USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is too late to implement 092 for 1987 crops since program signup will be over by the end of this month

6209	The House of Representatives approved a bill to enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrains farmers hit by midwestern flooding last year to receive at least 92 pct of their federal income support payments even if they did not plant The one-time pilot 092 program designed to assist farmers in Kansas Oklahoma Michigan and parts of Missouri was passed by a 304-100 vote and sent to the Senate Although the bill includes a narrow version of the 092 provision endorsed by the Reagan administration the US Agriculture Department withheld its support from the measure USDA said the bill would discourage farmers from buying crop insurance and fall short of the administrations proposed broad-scale revision of farm programs The bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented from planting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of the deficiency payments they would have received To be eligible winter wheat farmers could not plant a different crop on that land this spring although they could use the land for grazing or to plant hay USDA estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs largely because of reduced crop forfeitures The bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producers along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers who were prevented from planting crops this year because of residual damage from last falls flooding In addition the measure would require USDA to make full payment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approved by Congress last fall Currently because claims have outstripped the 400 mln dlrs in appropriated funds USDA plans to offer farmers in the region 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses The administration said it opposed the bill because by expanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief it would thwart efforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as an alternative to federal disaster assistance USDA also said the 092 provisions in the bill were narrower than the administrations proposal to offer the option to all major commodities and would produce insignificant savings USDA said the 092 option for 1987 winter wheat farmers would produce a net savings of about 30 mln dlrs while the requirement to compensate fully disaster-struck farmers would cost about 135 mln dlrs which must be appropriated by Congress The feedgrains provision would cost about five mln dlrs USDA estimated the overall cost of the bill to be 111 mln dlrs In January the Senate approved a bill that would make 1987 winter wheat farmers eligible for disaster assistance payments But the Senate bill would not offer the 092 option to wheat and feedgrains producers or raise the 400-mln dlr ceiling on the disaster assistance program

7062	The results of a controversial study of farm subsidies conducted by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD show Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies Results of the study which has not been released by OECD because of objections from some countries were provided to Reuters by officials of several countries on condition they not be identified The OECD study calculates the level of farm subsidies for the years 1979-81 using a new measure called the producer subsidy equivalent PSE The study shows that on dairy products Japans PSE or the amount of aid to farmers expressed as a percentage averaged 833 pct over 1979-81 with the European Community at 688 pct and the United States 482 pct For wheat Japans PSE averaged 958 pct the EC 281 and the US 172 Japans rice PSE was 688 pct compared to the EC 136 and the US 54 pct the OECD calculations show In coarse grains Japans subsidies reached 1071 pct compared with 279 pct for the EC and 131 pct for the US Japans beef subsidy was 549 pct versus 527 pct for the EC and 95 pct for the US OECD concluded For sugar Japans PSE was 484 pct versus 279 pct in the EC and 131 pct for the US the study shows The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrial countries such as Canada Australia and New Zealand but in most cases the results were much lower than for the US EC and Japan the sources said Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil two major developing country producers of commodities were not included in the OECD work Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries to release the study soon perhaps coinciding with the OECD ministerial meeting in Paris during May Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a basis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global trade talks now underway in Geneva British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visit to Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a starting point for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiate down domestic farm support levels which are a major cause of the present crisis in world agriculture However the OECD study results are controversial because they highlight the levels of assistance to farmers officials familiar with the study said The US Agriculture Departments Economic Research Service recently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt to verify the OECD results and update them to 1982-84 In some cases the results were substantially different than the OECDs in part because farm policies in both the US and elsewhere had changed markedly by 1982-84 from the OECD base period of 1979-81 US officials said For example the USDA study found the United States subsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982-84 at 25 to 49 pct than in the EC at zero to nine pct French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale citing the result of the USDA calculation for corn told reporters last week that the United States subsidizes its farmers more than the EC However the sources said EC corn subsidies are probably higher than the US now because of increases since 1984 Officials of several countries have been asked to contribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to 1985 subsidy levels a much more relevant measure of the current world farm situation The updated calculations which may take several months to complete are expected to show substantial increases in US subsidy levels for sugar because the US imposed restrictive import quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry US subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farm bill which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to grain farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice officials added
7215	The EC Commission granted 25000 tonnes of free market barley export licences at todays tender and 80000 tonnes of French maize grain traders said The maximum export rebate for barley was set at 13725 Ecus and for maize at 12975 Ecus per tonne All bids for wheat were rejected they said
7326	A statement yesterday by Secretary of State George Shultz after he met with wheat growers that US agricultural products must be competitively priced was significant in that he recognized the importance of the Soviet market and the need for US prices to be at world market levels US grain trade industry officials said They said that Shultzs comments while not explicitly endorsing subsidized wheat sales to the USSR were noteworthy because they were not negative towards such action In response to a query on what the State Departments position is on selling subsidized wheat to Moscow Shultz told the leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers that prices must be competitive if the US is going to trade The Soviet Union the worlds largest grain importer has bought no US wheat for more than a year complaining the price was far above world market levels A US offer last fall to sell the Soviets lower-priced wheat through the export enhancement program EEP was also rebuffed due to the price Shultz was said to be adamantly against the US wheat offer last year and has been reported to be one of the major obstacles in making another subsidy overture to the Soviet Union grain industry sources said Intense speculation the US might make a fresh EEP wheat offer to the Soviets has boosted grain prices significantly in recent trading sessions Kansas City hard wheat futures rose another 2-14 cents by midday at 288-14 dlrs per bushel while CBT March wheat was up 1-12 cents at 292-12 dlrs Im not sure this is an about-face but its clearly a recognition that unless were competitive we wont sell to the Soviet Union said a lobbyst for a major commodity group We have to be competitive Its ridiculous to say that somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same thing at a lower price somewhere else Shultz told the farm leaders That is our approach in negotiations with the Soviets he said If those comments do signal that the State Department is no longer opposed to the US selling wheat to the USSR under EEP it certainly improves the chances for an EEP wheat offer to Moscow an industry lobbyst said National Wheat Growers officials were taking a cautious attitude towards the secretarys comments His comments were not discouraging but they didnt in our judgment promise any immediate action on EEP an official with the wheat group said The Wheat Growers official noted however that there is significance in that fact that we havent seen any significant negative commentary on the idea of EEP wheat to the Soviets In a meeting with exporters this week Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng refused to comment on their request that the administration offer subsidized wheat to Moscow the officials said An aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz who is reported to be strongly opposed to EEP wheat to the Soviets said that the Shultz comments are consistent with what he Shultz has taught for years as an economist but said they dont necessarily relate to the Soviet Union Amstutz could not be reached for comment and an aide to Lyng said Lyng would not comment on Shultzs statements But trade sources were hopeful that the Shultz comments may indicate some movement towards EEP wheat to Moscow If he didnt say no then theres a chance This is potentially a positive development a commodity source said
7471	Secretary of State George Shultz has decided not to oppose any US wheat subsidy offer to the Soviet Union and has left the final decision on whether to sell subsidized wheat to Moscow up to President Reagan and the Agriculture Department a State Department official said Shultz feels like he fought the battle against a subsidy last summer and hes not going to the mat again Its now basically the USDA who has to make their decisions as to what they want to do the official said If USDA decides to go ahead with a subsidy offer to the Soviet Union he said Shultz will not wage a vigorous campaign against it He might not come out in favor of it but he wont go to the President and voice his objections In an official statement clarifying Shultzs remarks yesterday to leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers the State Department said Secretary Shultz expressed his belief that whenever possible US grain should be competitive on world markets including the Soviet Union The Agriculture Department is in the best position to determine whether consideration should be given at this time to extending to the Soviets a subsidy under the Export Enhancement Program Although Shultz will not oppose a wheat subsidy to the Soviets there remain obstacles to another subsidy offer to Moscow the State Department official said Everyone in the government agrees that if there is a subsidy to be offered we would not offer it unless we had a firm commitment from the Soviets that they would buy USDA does not want a repetition of last summer when the USSR baulked at its offer of four mln tonnes of subsidized wheat the official who asked not to be identified said The Soviets rejected the US offer then on the grounds that the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy was insufficient to bring US prices down to competitive levels The Soviets want a higher subsidy offer this time the State Department source said What the Soviets want is something equivalent to the lowest price being paid by anyone in the world he said The Soviets argue that they are the best customer of the US and that they are entitled to the best price he said Government and commodity sources also said there are elements in the USDA most notably undersecretary Daniel Amstutz who remain opposed to a wheat subsidy to the Soviets Subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union is still not a foregone conclusion the State Department official said
7545	Three geographically diverse droughts in Asia are being linked by some scientists to a reintensification of the complex and little-understood El Nino weather pattern ltAccu-Weather Inc a commercial weather forecasting service said Rice and wheat farmers in China wheat and sugarcane growers in Australia and tea planters in Sri Lanka all face serious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrive in time to break the droughts offical reports government officials and meteorologists said Wen Wei Po a Hong Kong daily with close Peking links said the drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinces have been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months Rice planting is threatened in eight provinces it added Rainfall in the key farming provinces of Henan and Sichuan was 70 pct below average during February the lowest figure for over 20 years the paper said The dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pct compared with last March and lowered the water levels of many rivers it added This has resulted in reduced hydro-electric power causing shortages to industry and households The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century causing many ships to run aground Wen Wei Po said Unusually high temperatures have also been reported across China media reports said The Peoples Daily said Sichuan has recorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than average since early February The New China News Agency said the average December temperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higher than last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984 Severe drought is affecting about one-third of Sri Lanka and threatens to reduce the countrys tea crop Ministry of Plantation Industries officials told Reuters In Australia concern is growing about below-average rainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along the Queensland coast and in Western Australias wheat belt local Meteorological Bureau officials said For many farmers and government officials the fear is that while the present low rainfall does not yet pose a major threat the prospect of a dry autumnwinter season when the wheat crop is in its early stages certainly does they added Concern is heightened by the memory of the 198283 drought which devastated the wheat crop and coincided with the occurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known as El Nino they said Although meteorologists are cautious about linking the Asia-Pacific regions disrupted weather patterns to any single cause El Ninos role is being closely studied they said Accu-Weather Inc which specialises in providing data for agriculture and shipping interests said each El Nino event was unique The El Nino does not always produce the same effects and the present occurrence is much less pronounced than the last major event in 198283 it said El Nino Spanish for Christ Child because it appears around Christmas is formed by the action of warm air bearing clouds and rain shifting from the Indonesian archipelago to the coast of Peru where it mingles with the cold waters associated with the Peru current and returns across the Pacific as the trade winds meteorologists said The winds strengthened by El Ninos pump effect raise the sea level off Australia and Indonesia they said When the winds drop the ocean seeking equilibrium sends a surge of warmer water back across the Pacific where it collides with the cold seas off Peru they said One effect of this heat exchange is to deflect the rain-bearing clouds away from Australia and Indonesia into the Pacific where they further disrupt other weather patterns The prospects for an end to the droughts vary Accu-Weather said China where the affected areas have received between 40 and 75 pct of normal rainfall will have to wait for the May-September rains it said The May-September rains normally provide the drought-striken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall In Australia areas of Queenslands coastal strip have received less than half the normal rainfall during the current wet season but prospects for increased rains are diminishing as the rainy season draws to an end In Sri Lanka the drought has come when rainfall should be at its maximum for the year The years secondary rains usually occur between April and June although it is not possible at this stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual
7934	The Soviet Unions winter grain crop is likely to have suffered losses due to dry planting conditions last fall and severe cold this winter an analyst of world weather and crop conditions said Grain analyst and meteorologist Gail Martell author of the EF Hutton publication Global Crop News said in her latest report that the Soviets may import more grain possibly wheat from the US due to potential crop damage Compared with last year the outlook for the Soviet winter grain crop is far more pessimistic she said But its still too early to talk about disastrous losses A lot will depend on spring weather not only for the outcome of the troubled winter grain crop but also for spring planting Martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probably prevented optimal seed germination for winter grains Key wheat growing areas of the southern Ukraine and North Caucasus received on 25-35 pct of autumn precipitation she said The bitter winter cold temperatures -- which broke record lows that had stood for four decades -- also may have taken its toll on Soviet winter crops she said However she noted that most of the southern grain belt had ample snow cover which should have well-insulated the majority of crop areas from severe frost damage The USSR has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grains in the July 1986June 1987 marketing year primarily from Canada the European Community Argentina and Australia Martell said She cited a number of reasons besides possible crop problems that might point to additional Soviet import demand Last falls dry weather may limit livestock grazing on moisture-depleted pastures while the cold winter weather necessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy Martell was also skeptical of a Soviet claim for a 1986 grain harvest of 210 mln tonnes and said the Chernobyl accident may have contaminated more grain than originally thought and have to be made up with imports However she said the US remains a supplier of last resort for the Soviet Union noting that the Soviets have only just recently begun their first US grain purchases of the 198687 season by buying 225 mln tonnes of corn Martell cited USDA statistics showing that since the 1980 grain embargo the US is only a major supplier of grain to the USSR during years of heavy Soviet demand In 198485 the US supplied 41 pct of record Soviet grain imports of 555 mln tonnes But in 198586 the Soviet Union bought 299 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the US for only 24 pct of that total While the USDA Soviet import target for grain for 198687 was 22 mln tonnes many US grain analysts have revised their estimates of Soviet imports up to 25-28 mln tonnes she said

8003	Total food aid needs in 69 of the least developed countries declined in 198687 as requirments fell in many countries in Africa the Middle East and Asia the US Agriculture Department said In a summary of its World Agriculture Report the department said grain production in sub-Saharan Africa was a record high in 1986 with gains in almost every country However food needs in Central America rose worsened by drought-reduced crops and civil strife Record wheat production in 198687 is pushing global wheat consumption for food to a new high and higher yielding varieties have been particularly effective where spring wheat is a common crop it said However may developing countries in tropical climates such as Sub-Saharan Africa Southeast Asia and Central America are not well adapted for wheat production and improved varieties are not the answer to rising food needs the department said World per capita consumption of vegetable oil will rise in 198687 for the third straight year Soybean oil constitutes almost 30 pct of vegetable oil consumption while palm oil is the most traded the department said
8179	Australian wheat plantings are forecast to fall to 1040 mln hectares in 198788 from 1172 mln sown in 198687 Australian Wheat Forecasters Pty Ltd AWF said in its first preliminary crop forecast But there was no reason to expect Australian production in 198788 would be less than the 165 mln tonnes of last year the private forecaster said as crops in New South Wales and Queensland suffered from poor yields last season Most of the fall in plantings was expected in Western Australia while state average yields would be assisted by growers sowing wheat on fallows and rest paddocks it said The main reason for a low Western Australia estimate was a poor profit outlook under cost credit and yield pressures But in the eastern states the wheat area should hold up provided that rainfall between now and June is not less than average AWF said Although some farmers were saying they intended to cut back wheat area by 20 pct AWF said this was unlikely since they needed cash flow and there were problems with alternative crops The lack of statutory marketing for oilseeds pulses and oats is a cause for concern if those crops are to comprise a high proportion of growers income AWF said AWFs state area forecasts in mln hectares with 198687 production in mln tonnes are as follows crop forecasts were not given for the new wheat year Area         Crop 198788  198687  198687 Queensland    082     082     095 NSW        307     317     440 Victoria      153     163     325 SAustralia   145     164     230 WAustralia   353     446     560
8273	Sen David Pryor D-Ark said he was considering amending the Senate Finance Committees trade bill with a provision to require a marketing loan for soybeans corn and wheat Pryor told the Futures Industry Association that there was great reluctance among members of the Senate Agriculture Committee to reopen the 1985 farm bill and that a marketing loan might have a better chance in the Finance panel The Arkansas senator said the marketing loan -- which in effect allows producers to pay back their crop loans at the world price -- had led to a 300 pct increase in US cotton exports in 14 months and a 72 pct increase in rice exports Pryor serves on both the Senate Finance and Agriculture Committees
8413	The Senate this week might take up proposed legislation that could serve as a lightning rod to expose broad initiatives to change US farm policy The Senate could consider a House-passed bill that would allow wheat and feedgrains farmers to receive at least 92 pct of their income support payments if flooding last year prevented or will prevent them from planting their 1987 crops Senate staff members told Reuters Also pending is a bill extend the life of the National Commission on Dairy Policy Sen Rudy Boschwitz R-Minn intends to offer an amendment to one of the bills that would suspend the minimum planting requirement for all 1987 wheat feedgrain cotton and rice producers an aide said Under current law producers must plant at least 50 pct of their base acreage to be eligible for 92 pct of their deficiency payments Most major US farm groups have lobbied hard against making any fundamental changes in the 1985 farm bill out of fear a full-scale debate could expose agricultural problems to budget-cutting pressures Representatives of these farm groups have said they also fear efforts by Midwestern Democrats to force a floor vote on a bill that would require large acreage set-asides in return for sharply higher support prices However Sen Tom Harkin D-Iowa sponsor of the bill told Reuters he did not intend to offer his measure as a floor amendment but to bring it through the committee
8535	US Agriculture undersecretary Dan Amstutz indicated the United States is willing talk with the Soviet Union about the competitiveness of US wheat prices but would not discuss making US wheat prices cheap There sometimes is a difference between being competitive and being cheap Amstutz told a Senate Agriculture Appropriations hearing Amstutz said the difference of opinion between Moscow and Washington last summer on the level of the US subsidy offered on wheat to the Soviet Union was over whether the US wheat price was competitive or cheap I think there is a US willingness to explore this issue as it pertains to competitiveness Amstutz said However Amstutz added that the United States would not be willing to discuss wheat prices with Moscow if the issue is being cheap Asked later by a reporter what he meant by the distinction between competitive and cheap Amstutz would not elaborate Amstutz said it is the US judgment that the long-term grain agreement between the two countries calls for Moscow to buy at least four mln tonnes each of wheat and corn annually at prices in effect in this country Amstutz made the comments in response to a question from Sen Charles Grassley R-Iowa about expanding the export enhancement program to include grain sales to the Soviet Union

9782	The International Wheat Council IWC lifted its estimate for 198687 world wheat and coarse grain production by one mln tonnes to a record 1377 mln compared with 1351 mln tonnes the previous season In its monthly market report the IWC said it is leaving unchanged its forecast of world wheat production for the coming 198788 season at between 520 and 530 mln tonnes against a record 534 mln in 198687 The one mln tonne upward revision in 198687 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments The IWC raised the 198687 coarse grain trade figure two mln to 87 mln tonnes It left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln The IWC 198687 estimate for world trade in wheat and coarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mln against 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mln rise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in 198788 is likely to be down from last year as low world prices and restrictive national policies measures begin to take effect At least four of the five major exporters expect to see a drop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries There is still potential for even higher average wheat yields but the IWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off Although it is still early to assess the coarse grain outlook the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in the European Community but increase in Canada US Maize area is expected lower but oat sowings could rise After damage to its maize crop last year the Soviet Union plans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mln hectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields are likely to be resown to this and other spring crops Improved weather and a further increase in the use of intensive cultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Soviet maize output in 1987 the IWC said Any reduction in world coarse grain output would be bolstered by the large carryover stocks from 198687 the IWC said It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks at end127of different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mln tonnes respectively against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier After record world durum wheat production of 2188 mln tonnes last season the IWC said there are already signs of another large crop this coming season with higher output expected in the EC Canada the US And North Africa
9793	Efforts by governments to control wheat surpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial success the International Wheat Council IWC says in its latest monthly report Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducing both price and areas as employed in the United States the IWC says in a survey of support prices in the five main wheat exporters - Argentina Australia Canada the EC and the US In some countries for example Australia and Argentina which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export income there may be problems in reducing production A policy of cutting wheat production could lead to unemployment with job prospects outside agriculture limited Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems The IWC outlines three courses of action open to governments in wheat exporting countries They could continue to support prices in the hope that when the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated Alternatively support could be limited to wheat which could be easily sold without needing to be stored for a long period This option may prove to be the most politically unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning wheat production the report said The third option would be for governments to distinguish between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture possibly varying support prices according to farm size or overall production The IWC review covers support prices in the major exporting countries since 1982 At some time during that period all the producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses These changes did not always result in lower export subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more than offset lower prices in the domestic currency For example between 198586 and 198687 the EC intervention price for bread wheat fell from 20930 to 17944 European currency units Ecus It dollar terms the currency in which most export transactions are denominated the intervention price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168 The high cost of supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers and some governments are now searching for ways to cut expenditure the report says The proportion of world wheat output produced by the five major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey from 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987 This was partly due to increased production in China and India The period saw an upward trend in yields although this was countered in the Argentina the US And Australia by lower acreages In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per cent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to other enterprises particularly livestock while lower US Acreages are attributed to official incentives
