4944	US February reports reflecting slim gains in industrial output and moderating inflation pressures reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to follow a stable course of monetary policy economists said If youre the Fed theres no reason to do anything said Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc There are hints that GNP is picking up On the inflation front all is well he said Money supply is well under control Its an absolutely ideal situation February US industrial production rose 05 pct slightly less than the 07 pct gain the financial markets had expected This compared with a slim 01 pct rise in Januarys production number previously reported as a 04 pct increase The February US producer price index gained only 01 pct less than a 03-04 pct expected rise This followed a 06 pct rise in the PPI in January The Fed is going to look at this positively said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation Certainly inflation is not as bad as what Volcker Fed Chairman has said lately Industrial production growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants The energy products component of PPI rose 40 pct in February after a 98 pct increase in January This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflation is behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs per barrel said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc The trend is still 35 pct in the first half of the year In 1986 declining energy prices contributed to a 25 pct decline in the PPI Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected but a sharp drop in auto prices was not Passenger car prices fell 34 pct and light truck prices dropped 13 pct Yesterday Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said that a possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in both the financial markets and the Federal Reserve The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectations today said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easier monetary policy Brusca said if import prices do not rise this could necessitate a weaker dollar The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air he said We need inflation for US producers to compete with foreign producers Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 08 pct in Februarys PPI With many electronic goods produced overseas this may show that foreign producers are not raising prices which bodes ill for US competitiveness he said If further dollar declines are needed this could diminish overseas investment in US debt Brusca added which might necessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices By contrast Slifer said imported goods prices rose 118 pct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting to a large degree a 22 pct drop in the trade-weighted real value of the dollar from February 1985 to February 1987 Slifer said import prices may rise further as manufacturers contracts put in place before the dollar dropped to current levels expire and new contracts are made that reflect a weaker dollar David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that imported manufactured goods prices rose 85 pct at an annual rate in the second half of 1986 which has contributed to rising US industrial output Its the other side of the lower dollar Wyss said Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitive and they are increasing output Wyss said that the latest data point to an average industrial production gain of 03-04 pct in the first quarter Its an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector is beginning to revive But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not convinced that the February reports portend economic gains He said much of the strength came from factors that do not point to a sustained rise in industrial output Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farm equipment industries helped account for a one pct rise in February business equipment production Utilities output rose 07 pct in February after gaining 12 pct in January but Roach said it shows mostly that more energy was produced not that manufacturing activity gained Finally he pointed out that auto production accounted for half of the industrial production gain as production of auto assemblies rose to 83 million units at an annual rate from 75 million units In the first quarter it looks like automakers are producing at an 85 mln unit annual rate but selling at roughly a seven mln unit rate Roach said The disparity between output and sales is showing up in inventories Economists pointed to sharp rise in January US business inventories as a sign that production may be outstripping demand in the first quarter of 1987 January business inventories rose 09 pct the largest gain since July 1979 when inventories rose 17 pct the Commerce Department said Business sales dropped 45 pct in January the largest monthly sales drop on record Nonetheless economists do not expect the Fed to react to month-to-month changes The Fed has been standing pat for the last seven months Ramirez said They will continue to stand pat for at least the next couple of months
