235	Indonesias agriculture sector will grow by just 10 pct in calendar 1987 against an estimated 24 pct in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or declines the US Embassy said in a report Production of Indonesias staple food rice is forecast to fall to around 263 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 2658 mln tonnes in 1986 according to the annual report on Indonesias agricultural performance The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 267 mln tonnes with a forecast 273 mln tonnes output in 1987 The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 15 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 169 mln tonnes in 1986 because of a drawdown on stocks Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane rubber and copra show little or no gain the report says The modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans palm oil and palm kernels Constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds limited fertile land insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops the report underlines The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as wereng or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties and to use lower-yielding more resistant rice types The government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee tea rubber plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 70 pct in 1987 to 145 mln tonnes from 135 mln with exports rising to an estimated 720000 tonnes from 695000 tonnes in 1986 the report says But while production of soybeans in 198788 Oct-Sept will rise to 1075 mln tonnes from 980000 in 198687 imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant The report says that imports of wheat soybeans soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last Septembers 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand The report said that Indonesias overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s It compares with 19 pct growth in 1985 and 67 pct in 1984 The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump

1405	Chicago Board of trade grain traders and analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to handle their upcoming spring plantings prompting sales of new crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans in the futures markets Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because corn is protected by the acreage reduction program That gives deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they sign-up for reduced acreage but they have no price guarantees With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing rather than gamble on soybeans even though the new crop soybeancorn ratio of 291 would make planting soybeans more attractive under normal circumstances An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln more oat acres this year than last without being penalized traders said Here too acres some farmers may have been thinking of shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats due to the more attractive deal from the government they added Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six months ago which should prompt many farmers in the South to put soybean land back into cotton One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans which are easier to grow one commercial trader said

5467	A 092 program would have very little impact on US acreage prompting farmers to idle only an additional 35 mln acres of cropland every year according to a report from the Agriculture Department The savings resulting from the additional 35 mln acres idled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings 35 mln dlrs in transportation and storage savings and 10-20 mln dlrs per year in deficiency payment savings the report said The USDA report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 092 acreage program for wheat corn cotton sorghum and barley Last year almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested The likelihood that the 0-92 provisiion will cause very large acreages to be removed from crop production is quite small the report said The returns on typical farms still favor participation in the usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permitted acreage the USDA report said The 092 program which would allow farmers to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment would be most used by producers in high productionhigh risk areas where cost of production is high said Keith Collins director of USDAs economics analysis staff In the heart of the corn belt you would not get that much participation Collins said USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheat would be ildled under 092 15 mln acres of corn 500000 acres of sorghum and barley and 500000 acres of cotton Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40 mln bushels of wheat 180 mln bushels of corn 20 mln bushels of sorghum 10 mln bushels of barley and 500000 bales of cotton the report said In determining whether to participate a producer would need to weigh the expected cash costs of production against the loan rate  The risk that market prices may rise above the expected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must be considered according to the analysis What youre giving up under 092 is the difference between the loan rate and the cost of production Collins said For producers with low production costs that difference is greater and can be applied to paying variable costs he said Under these cicumstances farmers would not want to go along with 092 But for high cost producers 092 would be more attractive Also as loan rates get lower Collins said there would be more incentives to participate in a 092 program I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal at first but it is a step towards the goal of separating production decisions from government payments Collins said In a speech earlier today before the National Grains and Feed Association USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is too late to implement 092 for 1987 crops since program signup will be over by the end of this month

6063	Israel has drawn up a five-year plan for 1987-1991 to raise agricultural production by 500 mln dlrs to 27 billion dlrs an annual rise of 34 pct the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture said Agricultural exports are to be increased by 180 mln dlrs or 48 pct per year on average The area planted to cotton is to remain at the 1986 level of 100000 to 112500 acres with exports expected to bring in 80 to 90 mln dlrs per year The 34 pct decline from the 1985 level reflects continued water rationing which will remain in force the ministry said Groundnut production is planned to increase by 13000 tonnes or 57 pct by 1991 and exports by 9000 tonnes or 82 pct Maize production is targetted to rise by 48000 tonnes or 48 pct and exports by 34000 tonnes or 45 pct
6269	Seven major US farm groups took the unusual step of releasing a joint statement urging congressional leaders not to tinker with existing farm law Following meetings with House Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza D-Tex and Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy D-Vt the groups issued a statement saying lawmakers should resist efforts to overhaul the 15-month-old law which is operating in its first crop marketing year The farm groups included the American Farm Bureau Federation American Soybean Association National Cattlemens Association National Corn Growers Association National Cotton Council National Pork Producers Council and the US Rice Producers Legislative Group The statement said Congress should not modify the 1985 farm bill so the law might have its intended impact of making agriculture more competitive in export markets while at the same time maintaining farm income We strongly believe American farmers now need predictability and certainty in farm legislation in order to have any opportunity of making proper production and marketing decisions the groups said

7917	There are heightened fears that El Nino may be returning to Peru with an intensity approaching the 1983 disaster which affected the weather on several continents and caused widespread damage through floods and drought the US Agriculture Departments officer in Lima said in a field report Continued heavy rains in the northern coastal area flooding of several major rivers and mud slides have led to increased concern the report dated March 17 said However it said official sources still believe that this years El Nino will have only weak to moderate intensity EL Nino is a phenomenon involving a shift in winds and waters in the pacific The USDA report said that so far the El Nino now being experienced has not had an overall negative impact on agricultural production Excessive rains in the Piura Pima cotton area may reduce yields by about 20 pct due to excessive growth too early in the crop cycle Also insect damage to crops could be more extensive where excessive moisture exists it said However the El Nino has resulted in a much improved supply of irrigation water in the major dams which will improve prospects for many crucial crops such as rice and corn and slow the decline in sugar production it said If El Nino picks up momentum Perus fishing industry could receive a setback But trade sources still believe the fish catch for industrial processing will reach 55 mln tonnes in 1987 almost 20 pct above last year the report said Water temperatures in the northern fishing areas are three to four degrees centigrade above normal but still not high enough to drive the fish to cooler southern waters it said It said there is still the outside chance that El Nino will intensify and carry on through late March April and May causing problems as crops approach harvest There appears to be no way to project the course of El Nino -- only time will tell the report said
8273	Sen David Pryor D-Ark said he was considering amending the Senate Finance Committees trade bill with a provision to require a marketing loan for soybeans corn and wheat Pryor told the Futures Industry Association that there was great reluctance among members of the Senate Agriculture Committee to reopen the 1985 farm bill and that a marketing loan might have a better chance in the Finance panel The Arkansas senator said the marketing loan -- which in effect allows producers to pay back their crop loans at the world price -- had led to a 300 pct increase in US cotton exports in 14 months and a 72 pct increase in rice exports Pryor serves on both the Senate Finance and Agriculture Committees
8413	The Senate this week might take up proposed legislation that could serve as a lightning rod to expose broad initiatives to change US farm policy The Senate could consider a House-passed bill that would allow wheat and feedgrains farmers to receive at least 92 pct of their income support payments if flooding last year prevented or will prevent them from planting their 1987 crops Senate staff members told Reuters Also pending is a bill extend the life of the National Commission on Dairy Policy Sen Rudy Boschwitz R-Minn intends to offer an amendment to one of the bills that would suspend the minimum planting requirement for all 1987 wheat feedgrain cotton and rice producers an aide said Under current law producers must plant at least 50 pct of their base acreage to be eligible for 92 pct of their deficiency payments Most major US farm groups have lobbied hard against making any fundamental changes in the 1985 farm bill out of fear a full-scale debate could expose agricultural problems to budget-cutting pressures Representatives of these farm groups have said they also fear efforts by Midwestern Democrats to force a floor vote on a bill that would require large acreage set-asides in return for sharply higher support prices However Sen Tom Harkin D-Iowa sponsor of the bill told Reuters he did not intend to offer his measure as a floor amendment but to bring it through the committee
