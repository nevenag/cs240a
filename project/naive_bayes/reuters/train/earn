1682	General Motors Corp staged an explosive rally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announced yesterday but analysts said GMs future remains clouded by stiff competition and erosion of market share GM shares rose 3-12 to 79-18 in active trading Analysts agreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they differed sharply over the carmakers long term prospects Im very positive on GM said Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co Theyre clearly committed to enhancing shareholder value However some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the buyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to recapture lost market share After the market had closed yesterday GM said it would buy back 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990 The announcement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares with more than 32 mln shares changing hands by mid-day The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the stock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning and at least one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a good performance expected from new car models But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the repurchase program is not a positive The buyback doesnt really change the earnings outlook and puts more stress on the balance sheet he said since GM will have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases The stock should settle back down to around 76 he added Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and 550 dlrs in 1988 compared to 1986 earnings of 821 dlrs Healys numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates which range from five dlrs to 780 dlrs in 1987 and from four dlrs to 1080 dlrs in 1988 Like other analysts Healy sees GMs share of the domestic car and truck market falling in 1987 On balance GM cars are not selling as well as their competitors he said In late February GM car sales fell 86 pct from the year-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co ltF and Chrysler Corp ltC both posted increases But GM said February sales showed improvement over January adding that it expects improvement in coming months Overall GMs share of US car and truck sales should fall to around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986 analysts said The numbers include imports Kidder Peabodys Kirnan said cost reductions and product improvements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the fourth quarter which will help GM finance the buyback GM stock has been a real laggard and now its rolling up its sleeves and getting serious I think theres a major earnings surprise in the winds he said Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today in part in reaction to the announced buyback and sees GM earning 565 dlrs this year and 975 dlrs in 1988 The company is more concerned than ever about improving their relative valuation with respect to Ford and Chrysler he said Another positive for the stock is GMs dividend currently five dlrs a share annually which gives it a higher yield than its competitors Kirnan said And GM will raise the cash dividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year he predicted But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said US car sales will weaken and GMs new products if successful will only slow but not halt the erosion of its market share I believe their new cars will be successful but that will only curtail losses in market share which will fall to around 35 pct by 1990 Lucky said Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle of the bulls and bears While he is recommending GM stock he said results will not improve until 1988 Im not looking for improvement this year This is a transition year for GM he said Fricke who estimates 1987 earnings at 780 dlrs and 1988 at 1080 dlrs said cost cutting and new car models will not affect 1987 results But the key thing isnt so much what they earn this year Its the momentum beyond this year thats important

11123	Canadas major banks will likely face stiff pressure to declare their Brazilian loans non-performing if as expected major US banks take similar action after the end of their first quarter tomorrow analysts said American bankers said last week that slow progress in debt talks with Brazil increased the likelihood that US banks would soon declare their Brazilian loans non-performing Such action would put a lot of pressure on the Canadian banks to do the same Levesque Beaubien Inc Toronto-based bank analyst Donna Pulcine told Reuters They banks like to appear to be conservative said Pulcine and if a major bank puts loans on a non-performing basis and the Canadian banks dont there is going to be a lot of pressure from shareholders as to why one bank is considering the loans non-performing and another bank is not Wood Gundy Inc bank analyst Patricia Meredith said any willingness by a major Brazilian bank creditor such as Citicorp ltCCI to declare its Brazilian loans non-performing rather than let Brazil dictate settlement terms would provide a compelling example for other creditor banks In order to make that strategy work they Citicorp have to have the support of the other banks said Meredith Bank analyst Michael Walsh at First Marathon Securities Ltd said at least one Canadian bank which he declined to identify wants to put the Brazilian loans on a non-performing basis and is trying to encourage the others to take that position Canadian banks are owed about seven billion Canadian dlrs by Brazil which late last month suspended interest payments on its 68 billion US dlr foreign bank debt Banks in Canada although allowed to wait up to 180 days before declaring loans on which they are receiving no interest as non-performing usually move on such loans within 90 days They could therefore delay action on the Brazilian loans until late May which falls in Canadian banks third quarter ending July 31 ltBank of Montreal Brazils largest Canadian bank creditor said last week it was not currently considering declaring its 198 billion dlrs of Brazilian loans as non-performing I think that is just for the benefit of the public Walsh said of Bank of Montreals statement Some analysts predicted minimal earnings impact on Canadian banks from a move to declare the Brazilian loans non-performing They said Brazil would likely resume interest payments by the banks fiscal year-end on October 31 thus allowing banks to recoup their lost interest income From what Brazil has said it is quite likely the banks will get the money said Meredith My outlook at this point is optimistic that there will be no adjustment for the full-years earnings Meredith forecast 1987 fully diluted per share earnings of 380 dlrs for ltRoyal Bank of Canada compared with 374 in 1986 430 dlrs for ltBank of Montreal compared with 359 225 dlrs for ltCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce compared with 223  215 dlrs for ltBank of Nova Scotia compared with 194 and 285 dlrs for ltToronto Dominion Bank against 274 She forecast 190 dlrs for ltNational Bank of Canada against 330 dlrs before a two for one stock split Analyst Pulcine said she might lower full-year earnings estimates for the banks by between two cts and 10 cts a share assuming a possible settlement reduced Brazils interest costs If the banks didnt receive anything for the rest of the fiscal year the impact could range from 16 cts to 70 cts a share But I dont see that as a likely scenario Pulcine said Walsh at First Marathon suggested however that the Brazilian debt situation was so complex that it could drag on beyond one full fiscal year He said he foresaw having to lower his 1987 fiscal earnings forecasts for the banks He estimated that Brazils yearly interest payments to Canadian banks totaled about 575 mln dlrs or about 10 pct of their total 1986 pre-tax earnings

11490	Canadas airline industry shaken up by a recent merger that creates a powerful new competitor for government-owned Air Canada has begun its first serious drive for profitability in 50 years industry analysts said Now weve got a company that can compete with Air Canada said Thomas Bradley of Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd Clearly it can go head-to-head in any market The new airline which arose from the 300-mln-Canadian-dlr takeover of Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd by the small but cash-rich Pacific Western Airlines Corp was launched last week as Canadian Airlines International Ltd Canadian Airlines will have 35-40 pct of the 6-billion-Canadian-dlr domestic market against Air Canadas 50-55 pct Wardair International Ltd is third with about nine pct Analysts believe Pacific Westerns aggressive and cost-conscious chairman Rhys Eyton will develop the true potential of the former CP Air which floundered for four decades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd They said CP Airs management style had been not much different from that of Air Canada formed 50 years ago because neither airline was held accountable to its owners Not that long ago maybe even just six months ago these two airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible Neither seemed that concerned about the bottom line said Bradley But with CP Air being run by Eyton it will be very conscious of profitability and shareholder return And Air Canada is on the verge of going that way he said CP Air always fighting for market share rather than profits was a perennial money-loser analyst Wilfred Hahn of Bache Securities Inc said in a recent report Prior to its takeover in December it had accumulated long-term debt of 600 mln Canadian dlrs From 1981 to 1985 its losses totaled 87 mln Canadian dlrs Air Canada widely expected to be privatized later this year in a public share offering lost 148 mln Canadian dlrs on revenues of 272 billion dlrs in 1985 It has a debt of more than 2 billion dlrs Although only a minority interest is likely to be sold to the public the prospect of privatization at a time of increased competition is forcing Air Canada to pay more attention to finances analysts said It recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit in excess of 35 mln to 40 mln dlrs for 1986 However this profit recovery was due less to management skill than the fact that all Canadian airlines had a good year in 1986 analysts said Tourists came to Canada in record numbers last year attracted by the relatively weak Canadian dollar and Expo 86 in Vancouver which alone had more than 22 mln visitors For the next few years most analysts see three-six pct air traffic growth and they expect profits will come from cost-cutting and careful spending Peter Friend of Walywn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd said institutional buyers will be eager to add Air Canada to their portfolios as a blue-chip investment but warned that new competition makes profit growth less certain The airline with something to lose will be Air Canada At one time it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobody elses Friend said Many analysts recommend that investors buy and hold airline shares for at least a year Analysts said Air Canadas immediate concern ahead of a public stock offering will be unloading unprofitable air routes without setting off a political storm It also will be faced with an expensive but necessary updating of its aging fleet of 111 aircraft Wardair preferring strong medicine now instead of later already has embarked on a one-billion-Canadian-dlr purchase of a dozen aircraft from Europes Airbus Industrie Canadian Airlines which has 81 aircraft last week ordered six commuter planes from British Aerospace and said it would soon buy as many as six wide-bodied aircraft from Airbus or the Boeing Co Analysts said Canadian Airlines with its newer fleet needs to make fewer replacements and can afford these without hurting profits Steven Garmaise of Wood Gundy Inc expects Canadian Airlines profit in 1988 will more than double last years 298 mln Canadian dlrs by Pacific Western

11711	Dome Petroleum Ltd earlier reporting a 220 billion dlr 1986 loss compared to year-earlier profit of 70 mln dlrs said the loss was mainly due to write downs totalling 2084 billion dlrs before a reduction in deferred income taxes of 571 mln dlrs The loss also includes 214 mln dlrs in accumulated foreign exchange losses the company said The dramatic drop in energy prices in early 1986 reverses much of the progress the company has made in the two previous years Dome chairman J Howard Macdonald said in a statement But even a net loss of this magnitude has very little bearing on the day-to-day operations of Dome chairman Macdonald said It merely reflects the realistic carrying value of the companys assets in todays economic environment and the absolute need for reaching a timely agreement with our lenders on a debt restructuring plan to assure the companys continued existence he added Dome is now trying to reach agreement on a complex plan for restructuring debt of more than 610 billion dlrs Dome said it charged the 214 mln dlrs in accumulated foreign exchange losses to current expenses because of the uncertainty arising from its proposed restructuring plan Normally the expenses would be amortized over the remaining period of the loans to which they apply it said Dome also said the write downs included a fourth quarter reduction in the value of its oil and gas properties of 120 billion dlrs before a reduction in deferred income taxes of 305 mln dlrs The fourth quarter writedown was in addition to a charge of 880 mln dlrs on certain other assets taken mainly in the third quarter Dome said the 120 billion dlr fourth quarter charge resulted from a year-end accounting change made under new full cost accounting guidelines by the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants The company said it previously determined a write down of conventional oil and gas properties was not required at September 30 under the previous method of calculating the limitation of oil and gas values Dome said the most significant accounting change under the new guidelines is using current oil and gas prices in calculations instead of escalating price forecasts Terms of Domes proposed debt restructuring plan preclude the company from making an accurate estimate of future financing costs which are used in the new accounting calculations it said As a result Dome adopted current prices and costs and a 10 pct discount factor in the calculations which substantially conform with accounting rules prescribed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission the company said Dome said operating income from its crude oil and natural gas segments fell by 250 billion dlrs to a 1986 loss of 171 billion dlrs from prior year earnings of 7370 mln dlrs Dome said the steep drop in crude oil and natural gas operating income was due to write downs totalling 193 billion dlrs and lower energy prices that sharply reduced revenue Reduced production of natural gas and lower utilization of Domes offshore drilling fleet in the Beaufort Sea also contributed to the decline it said Earnings from its natural gas liquids business fell by 79 pct to 420 mln dlrs from 199 mln dlrs in 1985 Cash from operations dropped to 50 mln dlrs from year-ago 5420 mln dlrs and unrestricted cash balance declined to 2020 mln dlrs from 4660 mln dlrs Dome said 1986 crude oil production in 1986 was maintained at prior years levels through new drilling activity and improvements in productivity Natural gas production fell by nine pct as a result of lower domestic and export sales it said Oil and field natural gas liquids production totalled 86000 barrels a day compared to 87000 bpd in the prior year Natural gas production fell to 5360 mln cubic feet a day from 5910 mcf a day

11752	First City Bancorp of Texas which lost a record 402 mln dlrs in 1986 said in its annual report it expected operating losses to continue for the foreseeable future as it continues to search for additional capital or a merger partner The Houston-based banks 1986 financial statements received a qualified opinion from its auditors Arthur Andersen and Co The auditors said their opinion was subject to First City eventually obtaining additional capital The company believes that in order to address its long-term needs and return to a satisfactory level of operations it will ultimately need several hundred million dollars of additional capital or a combination with a more strongly capitalized entity First City said in a note to its financial statements included in the annual report Management believes that sufficient resources should be available to cover interim capital concerns while additional capital is being sought the bank said To raise cash in the near-term First City said it may sell or mortgage non-strategic assets recover excess contributions to its pension plan and obtain special dividends from some of its member banks The losses for 1987 are expected to be substantially less than in 1986 First City chairman JA Elkins said in a letter included in the annual report However the ultimate return to satisfactory operating conditions is dependent on the successful resolution of the related problems of credit quality funding and the eventual need for substantial additional capital First City said it anticipated that certain covenants of a credit agreement with unaffiliated banks requiring most of First Citys excess cash to be applied to debt repayments would be modified by the end of the first quarter in order to avoid default The banks agreed to similar amendments to the covenants last year and First City has reduced its borrowings from 120 mln dlrs at 1986 yearend to 685 mln dlrs in recent weeks Although the parent companys capital adequacy ratios exceeded regulatory minimum requirements at the end of 1986 First City said its two largest subsidiaries did not First City National Bank of Houston had a primary capital ratio of 534 pct and First City Bank of Dallas had a 475 pct ratio Hard-hit by the collapse in oil and Texas real estate prices First Citys net loan chargeoffs totaled 366 mln dlrs last year up from 261 mln dlrs in 1985 The bank more than doubled its loan loss provision to 497 mln dlrs at the end of 1986 First City said chargeoffs and paydowns reduced its total energy loan portfolio by 32 pct during 1986 to 14 billion dlrs at year-end adding that future energy chargeoffs should be more modest The amount represented 15 pct of First Citys total loans In real estate First City said its nonperforming assets nearly doubled last year to 347 mln dlrs at year-end Chargeoffs of real estate loans rose to 32 mln dlrs or nine pct of total loan chargeoffs and the bank said the amount could go higher The company still faces uncertainties in the real estate market and anticipates further deterioration in the pportfolio so long as the regional recession persists First City said Because the carrying value of many of these loans is collateral dependent a further decline in the overall value of the collateral base could cause an increase in the level of real estate-related chargeoffs

11773	Commerzbank AG ltCBKGF management board chairman Walter Seipp said that from the present viewpoint the bank must expect 1987 full operating profit to be lower than in 1986 In the first two months of the year partial operating profit -- excluding trading on the banks own account -declined he said without giving details The interest surplus fell 28 pct compared with 212ths of 1986 results while the commission surplus because of the quiet stock exchange business fell back still more strongly By contrast the personnel and fixed asset expenses increased German banks do not report full operating profit But Seipp said last year the figure for the first time had topped one billion marks for the parent bank and the group result was around 50 pct higher than this Commenting on 1986 Seipp said we were able to raise the full operating profitSlightly above the record result of 1985 because own account profits increased slightly He gave no concrete details but added that in January and February good own account trading profits meant that the drop in full operating earnings was more modest than that in the partial operating figure The bank would as a result be more profit-oriented in future developing for example more into investment banking keeping a tight rein on personnel costs and dampening expenditures on fixed assets Turning to 1986 results Seipp said by year end there had been a strong growth in business volume Over the year business volume rose by 99 pct to 932 billion marks compared with 1985 Seipp added Group balance sheet volume rose by 80 pct to 14815 billion It would have been around five billion marks higher still if currency relationships had remained unchanged In the parent bank the interest surplus rose nine pct in the year while the interest margin held roughly at 1985s 256 pct despite pressure on credit rates The surplus on commission business which had soared by a quarter in 1985 rose by 116 pct last year thanks almost exclusively to growth in securities commissions Seipp said Personnel expenditure was up 119 pct last year at more than 15 billion marks Fixed asset expenditure rose by 96 pct to more than 650 mln As a result the parent bank partial operating profit rose by 32 pct to 752 mln marks Parent bank tax payment rose to 244 mln marks last year from 233 mln in 1985 Seipp said extraordinary earnings included a high two-figure million in profit from the sale of the banks AEG AG ltAEGGF shares to Daimler-Benz AG ltDAIGF during the latters majority stake purchase booked last year The ability of the bank to write off depreciations in credit business against profits from securities trading and earnings on the sale of stakes had been utilised as in prior years to its full extent Because of numerous insolvencies at home by far the largest part of the provisions were set aside for individual write-downs from domestic business Abroad the circle of problem debtor countries rose last year although the ratio of credit exposure to provisions improved further Seipp said that because about half the groups exposure to problem nations was in dollars the bank had swapped into dollars individual provisions hitherto held primarily in marks This means that no open currency positions exist any longer on the amount of the provision that is made against an actual default he added Despite the increase in concern over debtor nations in the last few weeks he said the international banking community is better armed than it was against payment problems All banks had significantly strengthened their capital base most European banks had made considerable provisions against bad debts while goverments and central banks were better prepared for unforseen difficulties He described debt-equity swaps as a very interesting new approach to indebted nations problems There was a lot of interest in direct investment via an equity participation in Latin America particularly from West German firms

2061	Royal DutchShell Group ltRDAS earnings for 1986 from the US Fell sharply because of difficult market conditions lower crude and gas prices and also due to different accounting methods Shell chairman Peter Holmes said The Shell Oil dollar net income fell 47 pct in the year while the additional effect of currency movements reduced the contribution to group net income by 57 pct to 472 mln stg The group earlier reported a drop in net income for the year to 254 billion stg from 303 billion previously with lower crude prices outweighing the effect of increased sales by volume Although the figures were lower they were nonetheless at the top end of market forecasts Shell Transport and Trading Plc ltSCL shares the UK Arm of the group rose to 1139 stg from a close last night of 1106 stg Analysts noted that a general collapse in exploration and production volumes was partially offset by earnings from chemicals rising to 462 mln stg from 205 mln in 1985 Also a windfall tax credit and lower than expected currency losses had added about 100 mln stg onto fourth quarter results which was the main reason for the figures exceeding forecasts industry analyst Chris Rowland of Barclays de Zoete Wedd noted However he added there could well be a sharp fall in performance in the first quarter of 1987 due to the improbability that the group would be able to repeat the high refining and marketing margins of first quarter 1986 The impact of recovering oil prices would come through faster on the downstream side than on the upstream as such a high proportion of upstream activity centred on gas which typically reacted to oil price changes with about a half-year lag analysts said Holmes said that in the upstream US Sector the third quarter of 1986 had been the worst of all Only two of the oil majors had managed to make a profit in the period with Shell Oil being one of them The decrease in US Earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the group had increased share to become volume market leader Holmes added Continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdue US Exploration activity Exploration is currently pretty flat We are going to go on but at 16-18 dlrs there will be no massive upturn he said A renewal of exploration in high cost areas of the North Sea and the US Requires prices of around 25 dlrs a barrel Ultimately this would lead to a rise in US Imports If you are not exploring you are not going to find anything he noted US Oil production had dropped some half mln barrels a day bbd in 1986 and would continue to fall if the price stayed below 20 dlrs a barrel This favored OPECs attempts to stabilise prices as the lower the price the more likelihood there was of non-OPEC marginal production shutting down OPEC has done pretty extraordinarily wellEverything is moving in its direction he added

3490	Ultramar Plc ltUMARL said that while its fourth 1986 quarter had improved from the operational point of view several special charges adversely affected results Overall the year had not been a good one with upstream operations dramatically hit by the fall in crude oil prices and downstream operations also affected in the first half by large losses on inventories But margins improved in the second half and in particular refining and marketing in Eastern Canada showed a good recovery The company was commenting on results that showed a net loss for the year of 621 mln stg after a 716 mln profit in 1985 The fourth quarter charges included a 208 mln stg provision on a retroactive price agreement recently initialled by Pertamina and Japanese buyers of the companys liquid natural gas and 47 mln for the early months of its ownership of Gulf Canadas marketing assets Ultramar said it had also included the estimated cost of a further reorganisation programme which was partly offset by a withdrawal of surplus funds from US Pension schemes and a 135 mln stg provision for the estimated cost of selling its US Flag shipping operation The immediate outlook for crude oil prices was uncertain although it was unlikely there would be any sizeable increase in the near term However Ultramar said it was optimistic prices would strengthen over the longer term Its substantial reserves of crude oil and natural gas put it in a good position to benefit from any price recovery In the meantime Ultramars objectives were to improve profitability by selling or restructuring weak operations while strengthening core businesses and developing a sound operational and financial base Proven probable and possible reserves at end-1986 totalled about 700 mln barrels net on an oil-equivalent basis Ultramar shares firmed on the announcement to 187p from 181p at last nights close

3505	A spokesman for Preussag AG ltPRSGF said it was not yet certain whether the company would pay a dividend on 1986 results He was commenting on a Preussag statement which said results in 1986 were lower than in 1985 Preussag has frequently said its results came under further pressure in 1986 following a difficult year in 1985 Managing board chairman Guenther Sassmannshausen said in December the board would prefer to stick to its policy of not dipping into reserves to pay dividends The spokesman noted the final dividend decision rests with the supervisory board The Preussag statement said results fell in 1986 compared with 1985 because declines in earnings in metals oil and shipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends in the groups other divisions The spokesman said it was not clear whether the domestic group would show a net profit in 1986 adding this would depend partly on the level of provisions Preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from nine marks on 1984 results after parent company net profit dropped to 650 mln marks from 1030 mln the year before The Preussag world group made a net loss of 131 mln marks in 1985 after a net profit of 1545 mln the year before Domestic group net profit fell to 779 mln from 1222 mln The statement said its results in 1986 were affected by unsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as by poor use of capacity in the supply ship sector The reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarter of 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was an additional factor behind the drop in results Preussag said rationalization measures already introduced would not begin to take full effect until this year Preussags domestic group turnover rose to 448 billion marks in 1986 from 429 billion in 1985 helped by the first time consolidation of 9518 mln marks of turnover from its majority-owned oil and gas subsidiary C Deilmann AG Domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alone was 11 billion marks it said without giving comparison figures Preussag said its domestic crude oil production fell 40 pct to 94400 tonnes in 1986 while foreign oil production rose to 182900 tonnes from 174500 tonnes Preussag said its Amalgamated Metal Corporation Plc AMC subsidiary whose results are included in the world group accounts made an unspecified profit in the fourth quarter of last year AMCs large losses in 1985 caused principally by the international tin crisis were the reason behind the world group losses that year

5473	ltRoyal Trustco Ltd in a move unique among Canadian trust companies is pursuing a bold global expansion that could someday lift the foreign share of its yearly earnings to 50 pct president Michael Cornelissen said First Marathon Securities Ltd financial services analyst Michael Walsh said Royal Trusts international growth target is attainable But it will be a tremendous achievement because  theyre going to have to build an international earnings base larger than the earnings of a lot of significant domestic trust companies Walsh said Global operations which made up 22 pct of Royal Trusts 154 mln dlr 1986 net profit will post 33 pct profit growth this year against an expected 15 pct jump in total company profit Cornelissen told Reuters in an interview He said the foreign share of total profit would rise to 26 pct in 1987 and to 44 pct by 1990 Royal Trust Canadas second largest trust company with assets of about 1954 billion Canadian dlrs has operated internationally since 1929 when it opened a London bank Its aggressive global strategy began in the 1980s when other Canadian trusts the equivalent of US savings and loans were focusing on domestic retail banking The companys overseas ambitions were whetted by heightened domestic competition and impressive growth at its London bank operations which attained full British banking powers in 1980 Cornelissen said Last year Royal Trust moved into continental Europe and Asia with its 239 mln Canadian dlr acquisition of Dow Chemical Co ltDOWs Dow Financial Services Corp which included asset management merchant and private banking companies It was a heaven-sent opportunity Cornelissen said of the Dow Financial acquisition We achieved in one year what would otherwise have taken five to 10 years to set up Cornelissen stressed that Royal Trust would shun direct competition with major global financial institutions in activities such as international lending and stock brokerage in order to exploit profitable niches overseas in traditional trust activities such as asset management private banking and advisory services He said that Royal Trust hoped to complete negotiations before the end of this month to sell its London-based Savory Milln brokerage acquired in the Dow Financial deal The international market is so big and we have such a miniscule share of it that growth opportunities are really limited only by our energy and our desire to find more business he said adding that in trust-type services we dont think the international markets are well-served Aiding Royal Trusts foreign growth are greater foreign investment interest in North America and increased Canadian investment abroad Cornelissen said Central to Royal Trusts strategy is Asia boasting rapid economic growth and huge pools of Japanese capital said Cornelissen whose company administers assets of 7185 billion dlrs more than any other Canadian trust Citing statistics indicating that by the year 2000 Asia will contain two-thirds of the worlds population and 50 pct of global productive capacity Cornelissen said We knew we had to be there Royal Trusts 14 international locations include offices in Tokyo Hong Kong and Singapore The company also recently listed its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange The Royal Trust president said the company was stressing growth within its overseas units adding he did not foresee any acquisitions in the immediate future although we have our eyes wide open for the right opportunities Asked about Royal Trusts plans for the US which the company abandoned with the 1983 sale of its Florida bank units Cornelissen said the company faced a trust services market well covered by hundreds of small regional banks That doesnt mean to say we shouldnt be in the US said Cornelissen That is probably one area that we will probably do something with in the next five years He said the company would continue to emphasize its home Canadian market which Cornelissen and financial services analysts agreed would remain vital to Royal Trust Proposed government regulations to allow Canadian banks trusts insurance and securities dealers full participation in one anothers actitivies will mean more domestic competition for Royal Trust but not drastically more Cornelissen said

6708	Continental Illinois Corps ltCIL Chairman John Swearingen said he sees negotiations to reschedule Brazils debt payments taking at least three to six months Brazil declared last month a moratorium on payment of interest on its medium- and long-term debts The moratorium is expected to persist the entire time that debt scheduling talks are under way I believe it will take three to six months maybe longer for an arrangement to be worked out to reschedule Brazils debt Swearingen told reporters at a press briefing I think Brazil will pay its debts in the long run Just how long the run is is anybodys guess Swearingen said Earlier the bank holding company said Brazils moritorium may force it to increase non-performing loans by 380 mln dlrs and reduce pretax and net income by 10 mln dlrs in the first quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full year The bank will decide March 31 whether to characterize these loans as non-performing William Ogden chairman of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co of Chicago Continentals largest subsidiary said in response to an inquiry Ogden said the moratoriums will affect both pretax and net income equally because the banking firm has tax credits to use Swearingen predicted an increase in operating profits for 1987 because he sees higher income and reduced expenses Continental will reduce expenses through job cuts and reducing office rental costs In 1986 it cut about 850 positions In 1986 it had net profits of 1652 mln dlrs or 60 cts a share up from 1505 mln dlrs or 53 cts a share The bank transferred 459 mln dlrs of poor-quality loans and other assets to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp FDIC during 1986 It can transfer bad loans under the terms of the 1984 restructuring agreement with the government The bank will transfer the remaining 460 mln dlrs that it is entitled to transfer to FDIC by September 26 1987 Swearingen said It will choose loans based on ultimate loss rather than their immediate effect on non-performing loans In 1986 the banks loans to the Midwests middle market rose 20 pct at a time of overall weak loan demand in the US Concerning banking acquisitions Swearingen said the bank would like to buy additional suburban Chicago banks In 1986 it bought three small suburban banks Swearingen said he is concerned that Continental will be taken over because no bank in the Midwest region is large enough to buy it and New York money center banks are prohibited by law from buying Illinois banks He said however that the FDIC still has control over who will eventually own the firm because it still holds the equivalent of 148 mln common shares out of a total 215 mln The FDIC sold 52 mln shares to the public last year and has said it intends to sell the rest as quickly as possible The agency received the shares as part of its 45 billion dlrs 1984 bailout of the bank Swearingen who came out of retirement in 1984 to head the struggling banking firm after a career as an oil industry executive said he will retire when the three-year period he agreed to be Continental chairman ends in August He would not comment on a successor The bank will expand its First Options of Chicago options clearning unit into Tokyo Swearingen said but said its doubtful lending to Japan will occur because that country doesnt need external sources of cash

8820	ltShell UK Ltds pre-tax profit on exploration and production operations fell to 869 mln stg in 1986 from 212 billion in 1985 due to the fall in oil prices last year Shell UK Finance director Nigel Haslam said But he told a press conference that due to the high marginal tax rate on North Sea operations the main impact of the drop in profit was absorbed by a fall in taxation to 330 mln stg from 145 billion in 1985 The bulk of tax last year was Corporation Tax with Petroleum Revenue Tax PRT representing only 16 mln stg he said As a result post-tax profit from the exploration and production sector fell by only 126 mln stg to 539 mln Earlier Shell UK a subsidiary of Royal DutchShell Group ltRDAS reported an overall net profit of 757 mln stg up from 667 mln in 1985 on sales of 657 billion stg against 881 mln Shell UK Chairman Bob Reid said the companys crude oil output from the North Sea was at a record 373000 bpd in 1986 which would almost certainly prove to be a peak for the company Shell expects a fall in output of around 10 pct in the current year to around 340000 bpd due mainly to the decline in output from the major Brent field he said Gas output of 59 billion cubic metres and natural gas liquids output of around one mln tonnes in 1986 are expected to be maintained in 1987 he said A final decision on development of the Kittiwake and Osprey North Sea oil fields will be made in the next 12 to 18 months Reid said The Kittiwake field originally part of the 25 billion stg Gannet project abandoned last year when the oil price fell is now estimated to cost around 350 mln stg Economies on development costs for the Tern and Eider North Sea fields which were approved last year have brought the cost down to 30 to 35 pct below the original budget Day to day operating costs of the exploration and production sector had been cut 10 pct last year and the target is to keep costs per barrel constant The company drilled 17 wells offshore with 10 leading to the discovery of hydrocarbons although it is too early to gauge the commercial viability of these discoveries Reid said Restructuring of the downstream oil sector contributed to a profit rise to 187 mln stg in 1986 from 91 mln stg in 1985 Jaap Klootwijk managing director of downstream unit ltShell UK Oil said refining margins in the first quarter of 1987 were a bit better than the very bad fourth quarter 1986 In November and December in particular refining operations had shown negative margins following the fall in crude and oil product prices he said He expected margins to continue generally positive over the summer although they could dip to become negative from time to time depending on price movements A new catalytic cracker at Shells Stanlow refinery will now come on stream by the end of first quarter 1988 about five months behind schedule following a crane accident which severely damaged the plant last year he said Profits from the chemicals sector rose to 33 mln stg from 11 mln after the rationalisation of the Carrington chemical site Haslam said the Budget announcement on PRT relief by which companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying development expenditure on certain future oil fields against PRT was helpful but rather less than had been hoped for Reid said his estimate of crude oil prices this year was in the range of 15 to 18 dlrs If prices went much above that he would expect some over-production above OPECs official 158 mln bpd output ceiling which would tend to bring prices back down He said it looked as if the December OPEC pact to restrain output was holding bringing supply and demand into balance but the test will come in summer when demand for OPEC oil will fall
