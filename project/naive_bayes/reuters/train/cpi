179	Switzerlands economy combining low unemployment financial stability and a large external payments surplus is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory future the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD said This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government it said The OECD in its annual report on Switzerland picked out some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in inflation this year but said these gave no cause for concern The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product growth to 175 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986 and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 125 pct after last years sharp fall to 075 pct from 36 pct in 1985 But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest increase in the workforce leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at around one pct the lowest in the 24-industrial nation OECD area Assuming an average exchange rate of 171 Swiss francs to the dollar this year against 169 in the second half of 1986 the report forecast a 275 pct rise in exports and a 35 pct rise in imports this year after rises of 325 pct and 65 pct respectively in 1986 The faster growth of imports compared with exports this year and last reflecting buoyant private consumption meant that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP would shrink in both years But given Switzerlands large external surplus there should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than GDPWhich if only in a small way would contribute to improving international balances the OECD said Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually buoyant last year with a 325 pct growth rate after several years of relative weakness it noted In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat to a 225 pct growth rate but should still outstrip overall GDP it added The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained bright into 1987 and with capacity use at near record levels last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation in both the industry and service sectors it said As a consequence growth in machinery and equipment investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year after vigorous growth in 1986 But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for tourism and the banking industry two major service sector earners of foreign exchange The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc and the accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets could lead to a loss of international market share for both it said Particularly for the banks recent developments in international financial markets give rise to the question whether the Swiss financial system which has shown substantial flexibility in the past is adapting itself at the speed required  To preserve its competitive position it said
209	Frances right wing government is facing growing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising down its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflation forecasts for this year Moving reluctantly into line with most private sector forecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflation estimate a half percentage point to 25 per cent and cut its economic growth estimate to between two and 28 per cent from a 28 per cent target written into the annual budget last september Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figures would not push the government off its chosen mix of price deregulation budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they would push to protect the purchasing power of their members raising the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believed Prime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growth and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year perhaps in the autumn to boost his prospects in Presidential elections due by April 1988 The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais We have the impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth this year The big question is whether the governments policy of wage moderation will be maintained he added The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout 17 per cent this year with a three per cent ceiling for rises justified by increased productivity But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation Edmond Maire meeting with Chirac today renewed union demands already rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher prices Calling the governments policies unbalanced and unjust he also demanded investment incentives to boost employment He announced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the government would spend two billion francs on a series of measures to boost employment and training Andre Bergeron a widely respected leader of the moderate Force Ouvriere labour group put similar demands to Chirac earlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT the largest of Frances unions declared the defence of its members earnings its top priority But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month and still rising government supporters and some economic analysts said they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist government and I dont think this administration is going to reverse that commented Michel Develle economist at recently-privatised Banque Paribas Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas and the New Year partly blamed by the government for higher inflation had undermined the unions power and popularity he said Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more than the governments revised forecast perhaps to 26 or 27 per cent this year against last years 21 per cent But that would still be an exceptional achievement considering that for the first time since the Second World War all french prices have been freed he commented Finance Ministry officials said that the governments abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible for nearly a quarter of a 09 per cent surge in January living costs But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should have no knock-on impact on the rest of the year Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that so long as the government kept wages under control Prices could rise 15 per cent in the first three months of 1987 and two per cent in the first half year fractionally more than forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute INSEE  Marais said But the second half year should be better he added Ironically one side effect of higher inflation could be to help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget deficit several analysts said So long as public sector wages are held down higher Value Added Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than expected growth they said

14770	Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German economic growth In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs here Poehl said It would be an extremely risky policy to aim for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit He said the United States could face a vicious circle of depreciation inflation and more depreciation if it took that route Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet US Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy accelerating tax cuts cutting interest rates and tolerating above-target money supply growth He said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to the beginning of this year but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the West German parliament But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could accept on exports from a rising mark he said Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about one-third of its gross national product so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home A further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth he said Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade had given some extra leeway But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct not the reported negative inflation rates last year and West Germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments For the time being we will have to focus our policy more on the external side and we can live with a more expansionary money supply But we must be very careful he said He said he shared some of the US Concern about Japans trade surpluses which affected European countries as well as the United States Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries saying the importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level and that further changes would damage growth he said This was a remarkable change in attitude especially on the part of our American colleagues he said But he said there was still a danger that the correction of the dollars value could overshoot

3411	A confidential World Bank report on the Peruvian economy has said the governments strategy does not offer good prospects for medium and long-term growth and is likely to lead to an early renewal of inflationary pressure The report published today by the economic monthly The Peru Report said the success of president Alan Garcias government in stimulating output last year to achieve a growth in gross domestic product of over eight pct represents gains in the short term at the expense of the long Government officials had no immediate comment on the report which advised a reduction in the overall size of the public investment program and greater emphasis on the preservation of Perus export potential The report said that although the government had succeeded in cutting inflation from 250 pct a year in the first half of 1985 to under 70 pct its stabilisation and reactivation program was encountering rising difficulties An early renewal of inflationary pressures linked to monetary expansion exchange rate devaluation and an easing of price controls appears not improbable it added The world bank report said the governments policies had reduced inflation and short-term increases in consumption at the apparent cost of price distortions overvaluation of the currency balance of payments disequilibrium reserve losses and sharply diminished creditworthiness It said unless the government took action quickly to fix a competitive exchange rate and control the public sector deficit the higher the probability will be that the government will eventually have to resort to drastic curtailment of domestic demand and either sharp devaluation or still further controls on imports in order to stem inflation and support the balance of payments It said the bank would place more emphasis on the preservation of perus export potential external links and overall economic efficiency The governments incentive policies towards the mining and petroleum sectors among its main traditional exports suggested that it did not accord high priority to their economic viability it added
3593	National Bank of Hungary first vice-president Janos Fekete said he hoped a planned eight pct devaluation of the forint will spur exports and redress last years severe trade deficit with the West Fekete told Reuters in an interview Hungary must achieve at least equilibrium on its hard currency trade It is useful to have a devaluation he said There is now a real push to our exports and a bit of a curb to our imports The official news agency MTI said today Hungary would devalue by eight pct and it expected the new rates to be announced later today Fekete said the rates would come into effect tomorrow He said one reason for the devaluation was that Hungary had a higher rate of inflation over the past two years than its main partners around eight pct in 1985 and between five and 55 pct in 1986 This was partly an after-effect of action Hungary took to prevent inflation from soaring during the oil price shocks of the 1970s he added Hungary devalued by a similar amount last September and by between three and four pct early last year But the countrys hard currency trade balance nevertheless fell into a deficit of 5394 mln dlrs from a surplus of 2953 mln in 1986 and 12 billion in 1985 Fekete said Hungary was hoping for a hard currency trade surplus of between 200 and 300 mln dlrs this year but that a more likely outcome would be closer to equilibrium on total hard currency trade of around 10 billion dlrs One Western commercial attache here said Devaluation of itself will not change anything It will only be useful if they also make efforts to restructure industry and improve the quality of their export goods Fekete said he hoped to raise credits on good terms this year to invest in restructuring industry It would be his role to persuade international banks to cooperate in this process He noted Hungary had been given an AA rating enabling it to raise money on the Japanese Samurai bond market Hungarys net hard currency debt soared to 779 billion dlrs last year from 501 billion in 1985 partly because of a current account deficit of 142 billion dlrs and partly because the fall in the dollar increased the dollar value of debt denominated in marks or yen He said he feared net debt would also rise slightly this year but he was in favour of borrowing for the purpose of modernisation I am for credits to invest for that purpose he said I am against credits for consumption He forecast gross domestic product growth of two pct this year from one pct in 1986 Fekete said Hungary would continue to restructure its debt profile by prepaying high interest shorter and medium term loans with cheaper long term money for which it was looking more and more to the fixed interest rate bond market where he considered rates to be low Hard currency foreign exchange reserves would stay at around 35 billion dlrs he said On the budget deficit which tripled to a provisional 47 billion forints last year after quadrupling in 1985 Fekete said the finance ministry was working out measures to reduce an approved target deficit for this year of 438 billion forints to between 30 and 35 billion forints

4555	Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said both the Fed and the financial markets remain concerned about the possibility of renewed inflation A possibility of renewed inflation remains of concern both in the markets and within the Federal Reserve he said in remarks prepared for delivery to a group of business leaders here He said one potential channel for renewed inflationary pressures would be an excessive fall of the dollar in the exchange markets which would push import prices up sharply He said participants in financial markets and business remain skeptical of prospects for lasting price stability Should the skepticism about our ability to resist inflation be reinforced by bad policy the consequences for interest rates for exchange rates and for the economy generally would clearly be undesirablerecognition of that danger neccesarily must weigh heavily in the formation of monetary policy the Fed chairman said Volcker said attempts to drive the dollar much lower would undermine the hard won gains against inflation and would risk dissipating the flow of foreign capital

5318	A year after squeezing to power with a narrow bare coalition majority Gaullist Prime minister Jacques Chirac has swept away a cobweb of controls and regulations choking the French economy But France is still waiting for a promised industrial recovery the government says will follow from its free market policies Company profits and the stock market are rising But so is unemployment Growth is stagnant at about two pct a year and the outlook for inflation held to a 20-year low of 21 pct in 1986 is uncertain Forced last month to cut the governments 1987 growth target and raise its inflation estimate Finance Minister Edouard Balladur ruled out action to stimulate the economy But some government supporters say they fear time for an economic miracle may be running out The political clock is ticking towards Presidential elections due by April next year Frances economic performance led by a mixed cast of right-wing ministers and a socialist President has won mixed reviews from non-partisan analysts For Michel Develle Director of Economic Studies at newly-privatised Banque Paribas the governments outstanding achievement has been to launch a veritable intellectual revolution breaking the staid habits formed by centuries of state control The figures may look mediocre -- neither good nor bad --but set in their context of structural reforms they are excellent Develle said But some analysts say they fear that Balladur chief architect of the governments free market policies may be pursuing a mirage The belief that economic liberalism will produce an explosion of economic forces is ideological said Indosuez chief economist Jean Cheval Personally I think its an illusion Dirigisme direction is a basic fact of the French system from school onwards Ultra-liberalism is impossible Illusion or not the government has pushed its vision hard Over the past year foreign exchange and consumer price controls have been largely abolished labour regulations have been pruned to ease the sacking of redundant workers and a hugely popular programme has been launched to sell state-owned banks and industries to private investors Since December nearly five mln French investors have bought shares in Cie Financiere de Paribas ltPARIPA and glass maker Cie de Saint-Gobain SA ltSGEPPA the first two state companies brought to the stock market under the 300 billion franc five-year privatisation plan Encouraged by an amnesty for past illegal exports of capital and the lifting of most currency controls money has flooded into the Paris stockmarket from abroad helping to lift the market 57 pct last year and another 125 pct since December At the end of last year the government abolished price controls that had existed for 42 years on services such as car repairs and hairdressing freeing from state intervention small businesses which account for some 60 pct of the French economy The immediate result was a 09 pct rise in consumer prices in January partly responsible for a forced revision in the official 1987 inflation forecast to 25 pct from two pct or less But even 25 pct would be a fantastic result when you consider that prices are now free for the first time since 1945 commented Develle of Paribas Other achievements include a major reduction in the states foreign debts and a cut in the state budget deficit to 1411 billion francs last year 25 billion francs below target and down from 1533 billion in 1985 But despite a healthy balance of payments surplus and a gradual improvement in industrial productivity the French franc was forced by speculators in January into a humiliating three pct devaluation against the West German mark its second since Chirac took power A recent report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development pilloried French industry for failing to produce the goods that its potential customers wanted Outside the mainly state-controlled high technology sectors French industrial goods were increasingly ill-adapted to demand and over-priced the report said French economists including Cheval at Indosuez agreed with the report One of the assumptions of the government is that if you give them freedom the employers will invest and moderniseBut nine out of ten will say yes they like freedom and then wait to be told which way to go he said And despite rising industrial investment and the introduction of special incentives to boost youth employment the end-1986 number of jobless was reported at a record 27 million some 300000 more than a year earlier The problem for the government is that there may be little more it can do to prod the economy into faster growth French producers failed more than most to take advantage of last years oil price falls and growth hopes now rest on the shaky prospects of expansion in other industrial countries like West Germany and Japan they say

8746	The US economy is showing some promising signs of accelerated expansion despite the sluggishness of the fourth quarter last year private economists say Some of the slowness experienced in the October-December period had been expected to spill over into the first quarter this year as the tax law changes that went into effect in January slowed business and consumer spending But some of the latest economic data show signs of surprising strength in the US economy although some economists remain cautious about the outlook The Commerce Department reported today that new orders for durable goods in February jumped by 57 billion dlrs a six pct rise to 1012 billion dlrs Even excluding volatile defense goods durable goods orders rose a healthy 38 pct the agency said The February numbers surpassed the expectations of many financial analysts whose predictions ranged from flat to increases of up to five pct The JanuaryFebruary employment statistics suggest the Gross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth for the first three months of this year said Lyle Gramley an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association The US jobless rate in February and January was 67 pct the lowest rate since March 1980 The number of new non-farm jobs rose by 337000 in February after a 319000 gain in January and a 225000 December increase the government said The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate of about three to 325 pct in the first quarter said Gramley Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuilding their inventories and is not likely to be sustained in the second quarter Gramley said He expects a slowdown in the second quarter with smaller increases in personal consumption and government spending He also sees residential construction declining mostly for multi-family housing units Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of the fourth quarter slowness will continue Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant 15 pct rate in the first quarter of 1987 accelerate during the second quarter and show a brisk 45 pct annual rate in the third quarter The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in the US trade balance which is expected because of the decline in the dollars value over the last year and half The improvement will be gradual and long lasting Levy predicted Most of it will be through import reduction but at least one-third will be due to a rise in product exports as the prices of US goods become more attractive overseas The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit which soared to record levels last year will improve this year and the US economy will grow by a respectable 32 pct for the year compared with a 25 pct rate last year As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit the US has been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate their domestic demand for goods from the US and others US officials believe that would help take some of the pressure off the United States whose five years of economic growth has been the mainstay of developing countries The US economy provided them with a giant market for their goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed to service their foreign debt The government last week said the US economy grew at a modest 11 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalance between the volume of goods imported to the United States and those shipped abroad The report showed a rising volume of exports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the fact that in current dollar terms the US trade deficit worsened during the closing three months of 1986 While fourth quarter economic growth was weak corporate profits jumped a healthy 61 pct during the period the government said It also reported that inflation as measured by the GNP price deflator remained in check growing a moderate 07 pct in the period the lowest rise in 19 years The government also reported that consumer spending a key element of the five year economic recovery jumped 17 pct in February after falling two pct in January The Federal Reserve Board also reported that the manufacturing sector which had been one of the weaker elements of the US economy was showing signs of recovery In its latest report on current economic conditions the Fed said that economic activity in the various regions of the country ranged from uneven or steady to improving Manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in most regions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said the pick up in the US manufacturing sector is largely due to the drop in the dollars value He said he does not foresee a major pick up in economic activity but does not believe the economy will slip into recession either He said higher prices on imported products and wage cuts that have helped the manufacturing sector will squeeze consumers purchasing power That pattern is starting and will continue for a number of years Chimerine said He sees economic growth hovering around a modest two pct level for the next few years
