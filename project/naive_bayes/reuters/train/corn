193	The US Agriculture Department probably will not offer a two dlr per bushel bonus payment to corn farmers for any erodible cropland they enrolled in the conservation reserve program last year an aide to USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said Sen Charles Grassley R-Iowa said yesterday that Lyng had indicated he would consider giving those farmers the same two dlr bonus offered corn farmers who are signing up for the 1987 program this month But the aide to Lyng said it was doubtful that the department would offer a retroactive bonus to farmers who enrolled land in the 10-year conservation reserve last year How are you going to stop the tide he said referring to demands that would follow from other commodity groups
197	US farmers who in the past have grown oats for their own use but failed to certify to the government that they had done so probably will be allowed to continue planting that crop and be eligible for corn program benefits an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said Currently a farmer to be eligible for corn program benefits must restrict his plantings of other program crops to the acreage base for that crop Several members of Congress from Iowa have complained that farmers who inadvertantly failed to certify that they had grown oats for their own use in the past now are being asked to halt oats production or lose corn program benefits USDA likely will allow historic oats farmers to plant oats but not extend the exemption to all farmers Lyngs aide said
235	Indonesias agriculture sector will grow by just 10 pct in calendar 1987 against an estimated 24 pct in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or declines the US Embassy said in a report Production of Indonesias staple food rice is forecast to fall to around 263 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 2658 mln tonnes in 1986 according to the annual report on Indonesias agricultural performance The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 267 mln tonnes with a forecast 273 mln tonnes output in 1987 The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 15 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 169 mln tonnes in 1986 because of a drawdown on stocks Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane rubber and copra show little or no gain the report says The modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans palm oil and palm kernels Constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds limited fertile land insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops the report underlines The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as wereng or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties and to use lower-yielding more resistant rice types The government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee tea rubber plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 70 pct in 1987 to 145 mln tonnes from 135 mln with exports rising to an estimated 720000 tonnes from 695000 tonnes in 1986 the report says But while production of soybeans in 198788 Oct-Sept will rise to 1075 mln tonnes from 980000 in 198687 imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant The report says that imports of wheat soybeans soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last Septembers 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand The report said that Indonesias overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s It compares with 19 pct growth in 1985 and 67 pct in 1984 The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump

12002	Speculation the United States will offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to have reached a new level of intensity in the run-up to Secretary of State George Shultz visit later this month to Moscow Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheat markets since officials from the two countries held their customary semi-annual grain talks in February Moscows decision at that time to reenter the US corn market strengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13 Shultz statement two weeks ago that he would not stand in the way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export Enhancement Program EEP coupled with the announcement of his visit to Moscow was interpreted by many grain trade representatives here as a clear signal that the Reagan administration was preparing an offer Administration officials -- in and out of the US Agriculture Department -- have been extremely tight-lipped about the prospects of a subsidy offer But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned the contention the proposal is dormant suggesting that an offer while not a done deal is a live possibility Prominent US grain trade representatives -- many of whom asked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that an offer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent Others who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible are saying they would not rule one out Rep Pat Roberts R-Kan yesterday went so far as to predict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days to two weeks Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaders who had been in contact with administration officials Richard Fritz director of international marketing at US Wheat Associates said he was confident an export enhancement offer would be made by the middle of this month Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end up being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier this year when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrs per tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat Some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheat subsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases of US corn and open the door to US sales of soybeans As ever one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat deal would appear to be price Last summer the administration took the controversial step of offering the Soviets subsidized wheat -- but were embarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds that the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left US wheat prices far above world market prices The administrations decision to set the subsidy level up front instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be a means of controlling the price while attempting to dampen criticism grain trade sources said Nonetheless the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultz from saying the Soviets were chortling because Washington was offering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available to US housewives The conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives here is that a general warming of relations between the two countries since last summer combined with continued hard times in the US grain belt would favor a subsidy offer In addition the USSR has made it clear it would consider buying US wheat if it were priced more competitively However observers have not forgotten the circumstances surrounding the administrations announcement of the wheat subsidy offer last summer Up until the time of the announcment congressional and industry leaders were led to believe the White House had decided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include not only the Soviets but also a much broader list of countries Instead the administration scaled back the offer to include only the Soviets That last-minute change of heart adds a measure of uncertainty even to the predictions of those most convinced that the administration will not now pass up the opportunity to sell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union
12052	The US Has been promised a near monopoly of maize exports to Spain from third countries guaranteed under an agreement with the European Community an EC official said The official who asked not to be named told Reuters that the guarantee was given in an unpublished clause of the agreement Under the accord which began in January third countries were guaranteed access for the next four years for two mln tonnes a year of maize to the Spanish market as well as 300000 tonnes of sorghum However the official said the US Had been assured that almost all the exports would be reserved for its traders The EC Commission is to ask member states to agree either a tender system to fix reduced import levies for the maize or to authorise direct imports by the Spanish intervention board EC sources noted that under a tender system maize from outside the US Would sometimes be offered on more favourable terms than that from the US No Commission spokesman was immediately available for comment

3847	US Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said Congress should consider legislation to apply the so-called 092 option to producers of major commodities Dole told the National Corn Growers Association that he thought the proposal supported by the Reagan administration should be seriously considered because a refusal to do so could play into the hands of those who want mandatory controls placed on production However Dole did not say whether he would support the 092 option which would offer producers at least 92 pct of their income support payments regardless of how much they planted The Senate Republican leader said the 092 option posed two problems First it is viewed he said by some as welfare In addition debate on the proposal could open up the whole farm bill Dole said Dole also repeated his call for an across-the-board export enhancement program saying a subsidy offer to the Soviet Union could help improve US relations with that country Dole said that the United States has made the decision to trade with Moscow and that its important to offer competitive prices The senator predicted Congress would have to decide this year whether to require an expansion of the export subsidy program which currently targets benefits to recapture markets lost to other suppliers which subsidize Dole who last year pledged to offer legislation to require a marketing loan for major crops but never did so again called for the marketing loan for wheat and feedgrains The Reagan administrations proposed farm policy changes are not going anywhere this year Dole said singling out the proposal to cut target prices 10 pct per year Asked by reporters after his speech whether he sensed a shift in the State Department towards supporting an export enhancement initiative for the Soviet Union Dole said he didnt see any change Dole also said it would be a very close call in the Senate whether to open up the farm bill to general debate this year Dole said he was encouraged by the selection of Republican David Karnes to replace the late Sen Edward Zorinsky D-Neb
3855	US Senate Republican leader Robert Dole R-Kan said he and a group of Republican lawmakers are considering introducing legislation to extend the ethanol tax exemption through the year 2000 Dole addressing the National Corn Growers Association board said the proposal was under consideration by a rural task force of Republican members of Congress and governors Gasoline containing at least 10 pct ethanol now receives a six cents per gallon exemption from a nine cent federal excise tax The exemption is to expire the end of 1992 Ethanol is produced primarily by a few large agribusiness firms including Archer Daniels Midland ADM and AE Staley The tax exemption has helped bolster ethanol production despite a sharp drop in the prices of competing crude oil

3949	The recent purchase of 15 mln tonnes of US corn by Japan and 600000 tonnes by South Korea suggests that the two countries demand for reliable supplies of corn is increasing the US Agriculture Department said In its World Production and Trade Report the department said that view is reinforced by the expectation of a decline in exportable supplies of Argentine corn and uncertainty over the availability of South African and Chinese corn With these corn purchases Japan is committed to buying 77 mln tonnes of US corn in 198687 Sept-Aug nearly 400000 tonnes greater than year-ago figures to date South Koreas cumulative commitments amount to 25 mln tonnes up 15 mln compared to last year it said
3979	Enrollment in the US Agriculture Departments fourth conservation signup is expected to be announced tomorrow and USDA officials said the figure may be higher than total enrollment for the first three signups Enrollment will be in the range of seven to 12 mln acres USDA conservation specialists said Total enrollment so far in the 10-year conservation program is 89 mln acres Producers submitted bids to enter 11 to 12 mln acres into the program Milton Hertz administrator for USDAs Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service said at a congressional hearing yesterday Not all the bids will be accepted Hertz said but enrollment is expected to be high As in the first three signups the Great Plains area is expected to attract the greatest enrollment The Great Plains area will be the predominate area which well get signup in a USDA conservation specialist said Marginal corn acreage will likely be the bulk of the acreage pulled from that area he said Fringe soybean acres in the southeast and some bean acreage in the midwest are also expected to be taken out of production but the USDA source said this would be a relatively small percent of the total A special two dlr bonus to corn producers who enroll part of their corn base acreage into the program has sparked more interest in this latest signup USDA officials said Under the program USDA pays farmers annual rents to take land out of production for 10 years The average rent payment accepted in the first three signups was 4350 dlrs per acre

4133	A Japanese real estate company said it will launch a campaign to sell land in US Farming areas to rich Japanese Higashi Nippon House said it would offer around 2200 acres of land in Illinois California Florida and Indiana from early April to gauge response It set up International Farm Corp of America in Chicago last September to oversee the operation American farmers would continue as working tenants and part of the profits from harvests of rice corn soybean and oranges would go to the Japanese investors as rental Japanese Agriculture Ministry officials told Reuters sales were limited to farmers to keep land in agricultural use Two years ago I began to seek my own farmland in Japan said Isao Nakamura president of Higashi Nippon However sale of Japanese farmland is strictly controlled by the government so I began to look for the land in the US to make my dream to own farm land come true Nakamura said hundreds of companies exist in the US To sell farmland to investors as more and more farmers face difficulties due to the recession in US Agriculture
4289	A Portuguese court has made a preliminary ruling that the state grain buying agency EPAC should not be allowed to take part in public import tenders open to private importers grain traders and officials said Under the terms of Portugals January 1986 accession to the European Community EC a grain import monopoly held by EPAC Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990 Private traders protested last year that EPAC was being permitted to take part in tenders open to them for the first liberalised 20 pct share of the countrys annual import needs The grain and oilseed importers association ACICO opened legal proceedings to stop EPAC participating in the public tenders Miguel Ascensao of ACICO told Reuters that Lisbons civil court in a preliminary ruling had decided EPAC should not be allowed to take part in tenders open to private traders Trade sources said the ruling though effective immediately was subject to appeal and would have to be confirmed in further proceedings A member of the government Cereals Market Commission said that as a result of the courts decision the Commission would not be able to accept offers from EPAC in a public tender being held today for the import of 80000 tonnes of corn Ascensao said the court ruling stated that EPACs participation in the public tenders violated the clauses of Portugals EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual dismantling of the state agencys import monopoly It also said the participation of EPAC which still controls the national grain storage and distribution network was unfair competition to the private traders Traders said they believed the ECs Executive Commission was unlikely to get involved in the dispute preferring to leave the case to be resolved as an internal Portuguese issue They the EC Commission will be keeping a low profile one trader said ACICO says it is ready to take its case to Brussels if necessary

4382	US Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said he was not sure a long-term US-Soviet grain agreement would be worth extending when it expires next year It hasnt been worth much in the last two yearsThey havent lived up to the agreement as I see it Lyng said in an interview with Reuters It would be my thought that its not worth any effort to work out an agreement with someone who wants the agreement to be a one-sided thing he said However Lyng said he did not want to make a definitive commitment one way or another at this point Under the accord covering 1983-88 the Soviets agreed to buy at least nine mln tonnes of US grain including four mln tonnes each of corn and wheat Moscow bought 68 mln tonnes of corn and 153000 tonnes of wheat during the third agreement year which ended last September and this year has bought one mln tonnes of corn Lyng said he had no knowledge of how much US grain Moscow would buy this year Ive seen people making comments on that and I dont know how they know unless they talk to the Soviets he said I have no knowledge and I really dont think anyone other than the Soviets have any knowledge Lyng said he thought the Soviets bought US corn last month because they needed it and because the price was right Our corn has been pretty reasonably priced And I think theyve always found that our corn was good he said
4490	Implementation of a one-year 092 pilot program for wheat and feedgrains was strongly promoted today by the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee as a way to cut farm costs and simultaneously give farmers another option when making their planting decisions We have a budget driven farm policy It may be a shame but we are locked into this said Dan Glickman D-Kans chairman of the subcommittee on wheat soybeans and feed grains We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt the farmer A 092 plan if properly done could do both Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 092 bill for 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains An aide to Glickman said that it will probably be introduced next week Glickman said a 092 program which allows a farmer to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency payment would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill --only an extension of the 5092 option already provided under the current bill It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill he said but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet budget goals a voluntary 092 plan would be better than sharply cutting target prices as USDA has proposed A 092 plan however would not be decoupling but simply a different type of acreage diversion program Glickman said Decoupling -- delinking planting decisions from government payments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at this point he said I dont think there is any interest in pursuing a decoupling bill this year Period Unequivocal Glickman said at the hearing Sen Rudy Boschwitz R-Minn cosponsor of the BorenBoschwitz decoupling plan said he supports a short term 092 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan Boschwitz plans to introduce a 092 plan in the senate His plan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment to participating farmers require that idled acreage be put to conservation use only prohibit haying and grazing on extra idled acreage limit participation to a certain number of acres in a county and provide tenant protection provisions I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987 but we can at least move in that direction Boschwitz said Robbin Johnson vice president of Cargill Inc testified in favor of decoupling Decoupling would end the current bias in US farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers dependency on the government he said A 092 plan does not go far enough in decoupling Johnson said and would still encourage farmers to plant Officials from the National Corn Growers Association and the National Cattlemens Association said their groups oppose any 092 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening the farm bill and creating more confusion among farmers But when asked if his association were forced to choose between a ten pct cut in target prices or a 092 program Larry Johnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 092 rather than take sharp cuts in target levels
4599	There were no shipments of US grain or soybeans to the Soviet Union in the week ended March 12 according to the US Agriculture Departments latest Export Sales report The USSR has purchased 10 mln tonnes of US corn for delivery in the fourth year of the US-USSR grain agreement Total shipments in the third year of the US-USSR grains agreement which ended September 30 amounted to 152600 tonnes of wheat 6808100 tonnes of corn and 1518700 tonnes of soybeans Shipments to the USSR in the second year of the agreeement amounted to 2887200 tonnes of wheat and 15750100 tonnes of corn
4825	The Soviet Union is rumored this morning to have bought up to 15 mln tonnes of US corn export trade sources said The amount was not confirmed but the talk was widespread through the trade Gulf cash barge basis levels jumped two to three cents this morning on the rumors which were expected to boost futures prices on todays open The Soviet Union recently bought over 10 mln tonnes of US corn ostensibly as a conciliatory gesture ahead of trade talks with US agriculture officials Purchases rumored today were seen as a positive factor in light of a Soviet trade officials statement that the previous purchase had satisfied near-term needs
4905	Grain traders and analysts look for a 10 to 12 mln acre sign-up in the USDAs conservation reserve program scheduled to be announced after 1400 CST today The USDA probably will accept about 80 to 90 pct of the acres submitted they said Total enrollment in the first three years of the program is only 89 mln acres so the sharp increase expected this year has underpinned new crop corn futures all week However some analysts said a 10 to 12 mln acre sign-up may end up being negative to new crop corn prices citing trade talk earlier this year that 14 to 15 mln acres may be submitted by farmers Also acres set-aside under the conservation program are by definition poor yielding so the impact on total corn production will be minimal they added
4939	The Soviet Union has been a heavy buyer of Yugoslav corn since October purchasing close to 15 mln tonnes in the 198687 marketing year according to a report from the US agriculture counselor in Belgrade Approximately 15 mln tonnes of Yugoslav corn have already been committed to foreign buyers for 198687 with most of this sold to the Soviet Union the Yugoslav Grain Association reported to the US official In a report dated March 10 the official said that about 800000 tonnes of the corn has been delivered with the balance of 700000 tonnes to be shipped between now and June An additional 500000 tonnes of corn can be shipped from July-September the grain associaiton said so total Yugoslav corn exports could reach 20 mln tonnes the counselor said Heavier than normal monthly shipping rates for Yugoslav corn exports are due to the increased use of river barges for exporting corn to the Soviet Union the counselor said Monthly corn shipments out of Yugoslavia have averaged around 160000 tonnes since October 1 higher than earlier estimates of 150000 the official said The Soviet Union has taken an increased share of Yugoslav corn sales during this marketing year he said
4988	A greater than anticipated need competitive prices and political motivations could be sparking Soviet interest in US corn industry and government officials said As rumors circulated through grain markets today that the Soviet Union has purchased an additional 15 mln tonnes of US corn industry and government sources noted a number of factors that make Soviet buying of US corn likely First there are supply concerns Some trade sources said recent speculation has been that last years Soviet grain crop be revised to only 190 mln tonnes rather than the 210 mln announced therby increasing the Soviet need for grain A drop in Argentine corn crop prospects could also affect Soviet corn buying an Agriculture Department source said Dry weather in Argentina -- a major corn supplier to the USSR -- and reported crop problems prompted USDA to lower its Argentine 198687 corn crop estimate this week to 110 mln tonnes down from 115 mln Argentina corn exports were also cut by 500000 tonnes to 68 mln tonnes Argentina has already committed four mln tonnes of this years corn for export a USDA official said with two mln tonnes of that booked for April-June delivery to the USSR Significant downside potential still exists for the Argentine crop the official said which will decrease the amount of additional corn that country can sell to Moscow If the Soviet needs are greater than we have been thinking then they might need more than what Argentina can provide during the April to June period he said Current competitive prices for US corn have also sparked Soviet buying US corn was reported to be selling on the world market earlier this week for around 71 dlrs per tonne Argentine corn for 67 dlrs -- a very competitive price spread US and Soviet sources said This price difference makes American corn competitive Albert Melnikov commercial counselor for the Soviet Union told Reuters Impending crop problems in Argentina will likely cause those prices to rise and with the recently strong US corn futures prices the Soviets might feel corn prices have bottomed and that this is a good time to buy sources said Finally some industry sources said that by buying the minimum amount of corn guaranteed under the USUSSR grains agreement four mln tonnes the Soviet Union may be hoping to convince the USDA to offer Moscow a subsidy on wheat In an inteview with Reuters this week USDA secretary Richard Lyng said that no decision had been made on a wheat subsidy offer but that such an offer had not been ruled out
5003	The US Agriculture Department has accepted 10572402 more acres of highly erodable cropland into the Conservation Reserve Program USDA announced In the latest signup farmers on 101020 farms submitted bids on a total of 11254837 acres The accepted bids for annual rental payments ranged up to 90 dlrs per acre with an average of 5117 dlrs per acre Land entered into the Conservation Reserve Program will be ineligible for farming for ten years and must be planted with permanent vegetative cover Producers enrolled 1894764 acres of corn base acreage in the conservation program to take advantage of a corn bonus rental payment that was offered by USDA The corn bonus to be paid in generic comodity certificates amounts to two dlrs per bushel based on the ASCS program payment yield for corn for each acre of corn based accepted into the reserve The state showing the biggest enrollment in the conservation program during this signup was Texas with approximately 1225 mln acres followed by Iowa with 1030 mln acres Minnesota with 890000 acres Montana 875000 acres and Kansas with 842000 acres Other states showing big enrollment were Missouri with 646000 acres North Dakota with 588000 acres and Nebraska with 554000 acres In the corn belt states of Illinois and Indiana 217000 acres and 116000 acres respectively were enrolled Farm land signed up to date in the conservation program totals 19488587 acres Bids on the previous signups ranged up to 90 dlrs per acre with an average of 4552 dlrs
5033	The 11254837 acres of highly erodable farmland submitted to the US Department of Agriculture for the conservation reserve program was within trade guesses of 10-12 mln and should have an overall neutral impact on grain and soybean prices Monday grain traders said Farmers enrolled 1894764 acres of corn base acreage in the conservation program to take advantage of a corn bonus rental payment that was offered by the USDA which may underpin new crop futures they said New crop corn prices firmed earlier this week on ideas of a large sign-up in the program But traders noted that the poor yielding acres being set-aside will result in only a modest decrease in final production figures since farmers will concentrate on high yielding land Of a total 11254837 erodoble acres submitted usda accepted 10572402 acres into the program at an average rental payment of 5117 dlrs per acre Farm land signed up to date now totals 19488587 acres
5109	US Agriculture Department USDA figures for highly-erodible land enrolled into the Conservation Reserve Program were regarded by most grain analysts as neutral to bearish although some said a full state-by-state breakdown would be needed to assess the full price impact Out of 105 mln acres only 19 mln acres were accepted in corn -- Thats neutral at best and perhaps bearish to what the trade was looking for Dale Gustafson of Drexel Burnham Lambert said The USDA said it had accepted 10572402 more acres into the conservation program out of bids on a total of 11254837 acres Gustafson said he would not be changing his estimate of planted acreage for corn as a result of the latest figures but some other analysts said they would adjust their estimates slightly The USDA is due to release planting intentions figures March 31 Indications of a heavy sign-up in the conservation program recently lowered most trade estimates of corn planted acreage to 630 to 670 mln acres from 670 to 690 mln Richard Loewy analyst with Prudential Bache Securities said there was not enough information to completely assess the conservation figures The 19 mln acres on corn is certainly disappointing he added The USDA later released the state-by-state breakdown of the enrollment figures Loewy said the initial figures appeared to be negative for both new crop corn and soybeans and might possibly mean an upward adjustment in planting intention figures Asked about the impact on the flow of generic certificates onto the market this spring he said The trade was definitely looking higher so certificates are going to be less than expected The USDA offered a special corn bonus rental payment to the farmers to be paid in generic certificates The bonus amounts to two dlrs per bushel based on the farm program payment yield for corn for each acre of corn accepted into the reserve Katharina Zimmer analyst for Merrill Lynch Futures said the conservation sign-up was slightly higher than she had expected although she noted that some trade expectations were considerably higher than the actual figures I think it is friendly for the market at least in the long run she said Susan Hackmann of AgriAnalysis said there was some confusion over whether trade ideas of an enrollment figure between 15 and 18 mln acres referred to the total sign-up or the latest addition It seems the trade was looking for more acres to be bid into the program she said Hackmann said she would not make much change to her ideas about corn planting figures as a result of the conservation sign-up She added that while some trade guesses were as low as 61 mln acres she was looking for corn plantings to be in the high 60s Zimmer of Merrill Lynch said she would be making a slight reduction of about one mln acres in her planting estimate to around 64 mln acres New crop corn prices at the Chicago Board of Trade firmed earlier this week on ideas of a large sign-up in the program despite the fact that acres enrolled are generally poor yielding and not likely to make a substantial difference to final production figures
5185	Tanzania seeks to export a surplus of 200000 tonnes of maize from last years bumper harvest agriculture minister Paul Bomani said yesterday The 1986 maize crop was officially estimated at 21 mln tonnes but only a fraction of this was marketed with most grain consumed by the farmers who grew it The state-owned National Milling Corp NMC meanwhile said it is trying to sell 190742 tonnes of maize stored in different parts of the country NMC acting general manager John Rubibira said Tanzania has only 56000 tonnes of silo storage capacity concentrated in Dar es Salaam Arusha in the north and Iringa in central Tanzania In addition the country has 450000 tonnes of flat storage capacity he added Rubibira said the government is planning to build new silos in the main maize producing areas of Iringa Mbeya Ruvuma and Rukwa
5338	Zambias talks with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund IMF on a financial rescue package have run into difficulties on the issue of food subsidies an official newspaper said The Times of Zambia which is run by the ruling United National Independence Party UNIP quoted official sources as saying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financing food subsidies and were pressing the government to explain how it proposes to pay for them President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidies last December in line with IMF recommendations but the move caused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riots The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves to quell the disturbances The Times of Zambia said another major issue in the governments current talks with the IMF and World Bank was the remodelling of Zambias foreign exchange auction The central banks weekly auction of foreign exchange to the private sector has been suspended since the end of January pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation and dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auction losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months but since the end of January has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine per dollar Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bank and IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 1250 kwacha per dollar on the currencys devaluation once the auctions restart
5467	A 092 program would have very little impact on US acreage prompting farmers to idle only an additional 35 mln acres of cropland every year according to a report from the Agriculture Department The savings resulting from the additional 35 mln acres idled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings 35 mln dlrs in transportation and storage savings and 10-20 mln dlrs per year in deficiency payment savings the report said The USDA report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 092 acreage program for wheat corn cotton sorghum and barley Last year almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested The likelihood that the 0-92 provisiion will cause very large acreages to be removed from crop production is quite small the report said The returns on typical farms still favor participation in the usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permitted acreage the USDA report said The 092 program which would allow farmers to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment would be most used by producers in high productionhigh risk areas where cost of production is high said Keith Collins director of USDAs economics analysis staff In the heart of the corn belt you would not get that much participation Collins said USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheat would be ildled under 092 15 mln acres of corn 500000 acres of sorghum and barley and 500000 acres of cotton Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40 mln bushels of wheat 180 mln bushels of corn 20 mln bushels of sorghum 10 mln bushels of barley and 500000 bales of cotton the report said In determining whether to participate a producer would need to weigh the expected cash costs of production against the loan rate  The risk that market prices may rise above the expected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must be considered according to the analysis What youre giving up under 092 is the difference between the loan rate and the cost of production Collins said For producers with low production costs that difference is greater and can be applied to paying variable costs he said Under these cicumstances farmers would not want to go along with 092 But for high cost producers 092 would be more attractive Also as loan rates get lower Collins said there would be more incentives to participate in a 092 program I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal at first but it is a step towards the goal of separating production decisions from government payments Collins said In a speech earlier today before the National Grains and Feed Association USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is too late to implement 092 for 1987 crops since program signup will be over by the end of this month
5518	US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter suggested the US could file a formal complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade GATT challenging Canadas decision to impose duties on US corn imports Asked about the Canadian government decision to apply a duty of 849 cents per bushel on US corn shipments Yeutter said the US could file a formal complaint with GATT under the dispute settlement procedures of the subsidies code Other US options would be to appeal the decision in Canadian courts or to retaliate against Canadian goods a lower-level US trade official said However retaliation is an unlikely step at least initially that official said No decision on US action is expected at least until after documents on the ruling are received here later this week

5610	Farmers enrolled over 65 mln acres of program crops in the latest conservation reserve program signup and around four mln acres of non-program crops Agriculture Department conservation specialists said Soybean acreage amounted to less than two mln acres of the non-program crop acreage enrolled a USDA analyst said Heavy enrollment of non-base acreage in wheat states of which a big percentage would be fallow and non-soybean land accounted for a large portion of the non-program acreage the analyst said Wheat and corn acreage comprised slightly over 40 pct of the total 10572402 acres accepted into the ten-year program USDA analysts gave the following enrollment breakdown -- wheat  2615140 acres -- corn   1894764 acres -- barley   705888 acres -- sorghum  585552 acres -- cotton   417893 acres -- rice       2035 acres -- peanuts      611 acres -- tobacco      285 acres -- total program crops  6512700 acres -- total nonprogram     4059702 acres -- total enrollment    10572402 acres USDA analysts are currently working on a complete state breakdown of crop acreage enrollment and should have it ready for publication later this week they said
5636	The United States has signed a Public Law 480 agreement with Honduras to provide for the sale of 120 mln dlrs worth of US agricultural commodities the US Agriculture Department said The agreement signed March 11 provides for the sale of about 75000 tonnes of wheatwheat flour worth 85 mln dlrs 15000 tonnes of cornsorghum worth 15 mln dlrs and 6000 tonnes of tallow worth 20 mln dlrs the department said The commodities will be supplied in the current fiscal year ending September 30 and sales will be by private US traders on a competitive bid basis Purchase authorizations will be announced as issued
5847	Maize deliveries to Zimbabwes state-owned Grain Marketing Board GMB will fall by over 65 pct this year following a prolonged dry spell agricultural industry sources said They said 1987 maize deliveries are expected to decline to around 520000 tonnes from 16 mln tonnes last year About 60 pct of the maize will be delivered by large-scale commercial farmers and the balance by small-scale peasant producers Although this will be the lowest level of maize deliveries since 1980 the sources said there is no danger of a food shortage in Zimbabwe While annual maize consumption is estimated at 750000 tonnes the GMB stockpile is currently around 18 mln tonnes which means that even with the sharply reduced production this year Zimbabwe has enough maize for the next three years The sources said the lower maize crop would be offset by a 25 pct increase in cotton production to 315000 tonnes from 248000 tonnes last year and by a rise of 20 pct in soybean deliveries to 100000 tonnes from 84000 tonnes in 1986

6142	Dry weather pushed further into South Africas Orange Free States Maize Triangle in the week ended March 14 the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility of the US Agriculture and Commerce Departments said In a summary of its Weather and Crop Bulletin the agency said scattered showers continued throughout Transvaal but dry pockets persisted in the northeast and south Temperatures average one to four degrees C above normal throughout all grain areas stressing grain-filling corn in areas receiving lightest rainfall it said The agency said rainfall during February was near to above normal in most areas but earlier periods of hot dry weather reduced yield prospects in parts of the northern Transvaal and southern Orange Free State
6221	Honduras has been authorized to buy about 75000 tonnes of US wheat about 15000 tonnes of US corn and about 6000 tonnes of US tallow under an existing PL 480 agreement the US Agriculture Department said The department said it may buy the wheat valued at 85 mln dlrs the corn valued at 15 mln and the tallow valued at 20 mln dlrs between March 24 and August 31 1987 and ship it from US ports andor Canadian transshipment points by this September 30 The purchase authorizations cover the entire quantity provided under the agreement signed March 11
6239	The US Agriculture Department said private US exporters reported sales of 350000 tonnes of corn for delivery to unknown destinations during the 198687 marketing season The marketing year for corn began September 1 This is the second day running that exporters have reported corn sales to unknown destinations Yesterday they reported sales of 150000 tonnes to unknown
6259	From April through December 1986 the Commodity Credit Corporation CCC issued 385 billion dlrs worth of generic certificates and about 18 billion had not been exchanged by January 1 1987 the US Agriculture Department said The department said an additional 43 billion dlrs in certificates has been authorized for issuance during January-August 1987 These certificates will provide ample free supplies of corn and wheat for the remainder of the crop year the department said in a summary of its Agricultural Outlook report Freeing of stocks through certificates is making US grain more competitive on world markets it said The department said last summer for example certificates were exchanged for 215 mln bushels of corn This helped increase marketable supplies so farm-level corn prices averaged about two dlrs per bushel -- somewhat lower than they would have otherwise The lower prices probably led to an increase in usage of 40 to 50 mln bushels it said The department said government spending on farm programs in fiscal year 1987 is projected to fall half a billion dlrs from 1986s 258 billion dlrs During 1988 and 1989 the cost escalation of the first half of the 1980s will reverse If current policy remains in force annual farm program spending by 1992 will be down from last years record by more than eight billion dlrs it said The department said the Presidents budget proposals for 1988-1992 would cut farm program spending an additional 24 billion dlrs In 1987 foreign economic growth is expected to remain close to 26 pct the same as in 1986 but above the 24 pct average of 1980-86 it said Partially because of this improvement US export volume is expected to rise in fiscal 1987 for the frist time in seven years the department said
6269	Seven major US farm groups took the unusual step of releasing a joint statement urging congressional leaders not to tinker with existing farm law Following meetings with House Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza D-Tex and Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy D-Vt the groups issued a statement saying lawmakers should resist efforts to overhaul the 15-month-old law which is operating in its first crop marketing year The farm groups included the American Farm Bureau Federation American Soybean Association National Cattlemens Association National Corn Growers Association National Cotton Council National Pork Producers Council and the US Rice Producers Legislative Group The statement said Congress should not modify the 1985 farm bill so the law might have its intended impact of making agriculture more competitive in export markets while at the same time maintaining farm income We strongly believe American farmers now need predictability and certainty in farm legislation in order to have any opportunity of making proper production and marketing decisions the groups said
6386	The joint committee of Taiwans maize importers awarded contracts to five US Companies to supply a total of 462000 tonnes of maize for delivery between May 10 and October 10 a committee spokesman said Cigra Inc won a contract for a cargo of 56000 tonnes priced at 7941 US Dlrs per tonne fob pacific northwest port for delivery on July 5 and 20 Continental Grain Co of New York received three shipments totalling 143000 tonnes price ranging from 9095 to 9575 US Dlrs per tonne c and f Taiwan for delivery between May 10 and October 10 Cargill Inc of Minnesota took two shipments totalling 83000 tonnes priced between 9200 and 9293 US Dlrs per tonne c and f Taiwan for September 5-20September 10-25 delivery United Grain Corp of Oregon won three contracts to supply 93000 tonnes priced from 9232 to 9319 US Dlrs per tonne c and f Taiwan for delivery between May 10 and July 30 Garnac Grain Co Inc of New Jersey received two shipments totalling 87000 tonnes at 8890 to 9229 US dlrs c and f Taiwan for delivery between July 10 and August 10
6585	The US Senate Finance Committee approved nonbinding resolutions urging the Reagan administration oppose Canadas ruling on US corn imports and a proposed new European Community tax on vegetable oils The resolutions approved by voice vote now will be sent to the Senate floor were they are expected to be approved The EC oils measure offered by Sen John Danforth R-Mo urges the administration to take strong retaliatory measures if the tax is approved by the EC Council of Ministers Sen David Durenberger R-Minn offered the corn amendment which urges the administration to file a complaint with the GATT if the US believes the corn decision by Canada was unjustified Canada recently imposed a permanent duty of 85 cents per bushel on US corn imports
6588	Recent purchases of US corn by the Soviet Union have skewed the domestic cash market by increasing the price difference between the premium price paid at the Gulf export point and interior levels cash grain dealers said Many dealers expect the USDA will act soon to reduce the cash price premium at the Gulf versus the interior -- which a dealer in Davenport Iowa said was roughly 20 pct wider than normal for this time of year at 25 cents a bushel -- by making it worthwhile for farmers to move grain By lowering ASCS county posted prices for corn the USDA could encourage farmers to engage in PIK and roll corn sales where PIK certificates are used to redeem corn stored under the government price support loan program and then marketed If the USDA acts soon as many dealers expect the movement would break the Gulf corn basis The USDA has been using the Gulf price to determine county posted prices one dealer said It should be taking the average of the Gulf price and the price in Kansas City which would more closely reflect the lower prices in the interior Midwest But we dont know when they might do it an Ohio dealer said which has created uncertainty in the market The USDA started the PIK certificate program in an effort to free up surplus grain that otherwise would be forfeited to the government and remain off the market and in storage Yesterday USDA issued a report showing that only slightly more than 50 pct of the 385 billion dlrs in PIK certificates it has issued to farmers in lieu of cash payments had to date been exchanged for grain With several billion dlrs worth of additional PIK certificates scheduled to be issued in the coming months the USDA would be well advised to encourage the exchange for grain by adjusting the ASCS prices cash grain dealers said A byproduct of the Soviet buying has been a sharp rise in barge freight costs quoted for carrying grain from the Midwest to the export terminals cash dealers said Freight from upper areas of the Mississippi have risen nearly 50 pct in the past two weeks to over 150 pct of the original tariff price The mild winter and early reopening of the mid-Mississippi river this spring have also encouraged the firmer trend in barge freight dealers noted The higher transportation costs have served to depress interior corn basis levels squeezing the margins obtained by the elevators feeding the Gulf export market as well as discouraging farmer marketings they said The Gulf market overreacted to the Soviet buying reports which indicate the USSR has booked over two and perhaps as much as 40 mln tonnes of US corn one Midwest cash grain trader said But dealers anticipate that once the rumors subside freight rates will settle back down because of the overall surplus of barges on the Midwest river system
6735	The Soviet Unions recent corn purchases from the United States could total as much as 35 mln tonnes US Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said We are not sure how much Soviets have bought but we think it could be as high as 35 mln tonnes Amstutz told a House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee He added that China also will need to import more corn this year than earlier anticipated but he gave no figures
6890	Argentine grain growers reduced their estimates for maize and soybean production in the current harvest in the week to yesterday trade sources said Soybean production for 198687 is now estimated to reach between 77 and eight mln tonnes versus 78 to 82 mln tonnes estimated a week ago and eight to 84 mln tonnes estimated in mid-February But even the lowest of those estimates would be 85 to 127 pct greater than last years total of 71 mln tonnes according to official figures and would be a new record The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was a record 37 to 38 mln hectares and increased 108 to 138 pct compared to the 33 mln hectares planted last year The change in yield estimates is due to very high temperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year in the soybean-producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires province The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybean pods empty especially in Cordoba Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops since rainfall was slight in most main soybean-producing areas Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak in Buenos Aires province totalling between one and 10 mm There was no recorded rain in other grain-producing provinces With clear skies and seasonable temperatures fields were able to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recent weeks allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize sunflower and sorghum harvesting Crops were considered in generally good condition though it is still too early to judge whether the intense rains of recent weeks caused any long-term damage The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of the total area planted compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at 358 to 378 mln hectares down two to seven pct from the 385 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest Total production for the current maize harvest is expected to reach between 99 and 101 mln tonnes versus 10 to 102 mln tonnes estimated a week ago The new figure is 211 to 227 pct lower than the 128 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest according to official figures The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct of total planted area versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was two to 22 mln hectares or 299 to 363 pct lower than the record 314 mln hectares planted in the 198586 harvest The current harvests volume was again expected to be between 23 and 26 mln tonnes or 341 to 415 pct lower than last harvests record 41 mln tonnes Yields varied widely from area to area and growers feared that heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll on crops and consequently on total production volume The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct of total planted area compared to four to six pct a week ago Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 12 and 13 mln hectares or 103 to 152 pct lower than the 14 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest Estimates for total sorghum production this harvest remained at 32 to 35 mln tonnes again this week or 167 to 22 pct lower than last harvests total volume of 41 to 42 mln tonnes
6897	Taiwan overnight bought 450000 tonnes of US number two corn 145 pct moisture for Gulf and West Coast shipment in 11 cargoes between May and October private export sources said Gulf shipment ranged in prices from 7517 to 7845 dlrs per tonne stowed and trimmed FOB euqivalent and West Coast shipments ranged from 7941 to 8102 dlrs per tonne stowed and trimmed FOB equivalent they said
7062	The results of a controversial study of farm subsidies conducted by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD show Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies Results of the study which has not been released by OECD because of objections from some countries were provided to Reuters by officials of several countries on condition they not be identified The OECD study calculates the level of farm subsidies for the years 1979-81 using a new measure called the producer subsidy equivalent PSE The study shows that on dairy products Japans PSE or the amount of aid to farmers expressed as a percentage averaged 833 pct over 1979-81 with the European Community at 688 pct and the United States 482 pct For wheat Japans PSE averaged 958 pct the EC 281 and the US 172 Japans rice PSE was 688 pct compared to the EC 136 and the US 54 pct the OECD calculations show In coarse grains Japans subsidies reached 1071 pct compared with 279 pct for the EC and 131 pct for the US Japans beef subsidy was 549 pct versus 527 pct for the EC and 95 pct for the US OECD concluded For sugar Japans PSE was 484 pct versus 279 pct in the EC and 131 pct for the US the study shows The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrial countries such as Canada Australia and New Zealand but in most cases the results were much lower than for the US EC and Japan the sources said Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil two major developing country producers of commodities were not included in the OECD work Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries to release the study soon perhaps coinciding with the OECD ministerial meeting in Paris during May Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a basis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global trade talks now underway in Geneva British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visit to Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a starting point for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiate down domestic farm support levels which are a major cause of the present crisis in world agriculture However the OECD study results are controversial because they highlight the levels of assistance to farmers officials familiar with the study said The US Agriculture Departments Economic Research Service recently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt to verify the OECD results and update them to 1982-84 In some cases the results were substantially different than the OECDs in part because farm policies in both the US and elsewhere had changed markedly by 1982-84 from the OECD base period of 1979-81 US officials said For example the USDA study found the United States subsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982-84 at 25 to 49 pct than in the EC at zero to nine pct French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale citing the result of the USDA calculation for corn told reporters last week that the United States subsidizes its farmers more than the EC However the sources said EC corn subsidies are probably higher than the US now because of increases since 1984 Officials of several countries have been asked to contribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to 1985 subsidy levels a much more relevant measure of the current world farm situation The updated calculations which may take several months to complete are expected to show substantial increases in US subsidy levels for sugar because the US imposed restrictive import quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry US subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farm bill which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to grain farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice officials added
7215	The EC Commission granted 25000 tonnes of free market barley export licences at todays tender and 80000 tonnes of French maize grain traders said The maximum export rebate for barley was set at 13725 Ecus and for maize at 12975 Ecus per tonne All bids for wheat were rejected they said
7336	The European Community Commission has decided to abolish a special tax of eight Ecus per tonne imposed on exports of Spanish maize Commission sources said They said the tax which applies to Spanish sales to EC and non-EC countries alike would no longer be required on exports from Spanish ports south of Valencia The decision was taken at a meeting of the authoritys cereals management committee today The tax had been introduced last September at the same time as a subsidy of eight Ecus per tonne was brought in for exports of maize to Spain from other EC member countries The aim of the tax was to prevent the maize imported into Spain from the other EC states with the help of subsidies from being reexported back to them The sources added that Spain had received no answer from the committee to its request that tenders be opened for the sale to third countries of 450000 tonnes of maize The request will be considered at the committees next meeting the commission sources said Madrid estimates that it needs to import 17 mln tonnes of maize this year while an EC-US accord guarantees non-EC producer sales to Spain of two mln tonnes of maize and 300000 tonnes of sorghum annually for the next four years
7395	The US Agriculture Department said private US exporters reported new sales of 900000 tonnes of corn to the Soviet Union and 350000 tonnes of corn switched from previously announced unknown destinations to the USSR The corn is for delivery during the 198687 marketing year and under the fourth year of the US-USSR Long Term Grain Supply Agreement the USDA said The department said exporters also reported corn sales of 143000 tonnes for delivery to Taiwan with 56000 tonnes for shipment in the 198687 season and the balance for shipment in the 198788 year The marketing year for corn began September 1 Sales of corn to the USSR for delivery during the fourth year of the agreement which ends this September 30 now total 225 mln tonnes
7700	Grain analysts surveyed by the American Soybean Association ASA projected acreage this year at 591 mln acres of soybeans and 647 mln acres of corn In 1986 farmers planted 615 mln acres of soybeans and 767 mln acres of corn according to the February 9 USDA supplydemand report The USDA is to release its 1987 planting intentions report March 31 The survey included 15 soybean estimates and 13 corn estimates and was released in the March 16 Soybean Update newsletter sent to members Estimates ranged from 560 mln to 630 mln acres of soybeans and 595 mln to 680 mln acres of corn An ASA spokesman said the association plans no survey of farmers planting intentions this year
7792	The Agriculture Department is not considering any major changes in its pricing system for posted county prices an Agriculture Department offical said We do not have current plans to make any major adjustments or changes in our pricing said Bob Sindt USDA assistant deputy administrator for commodity operations US grain traders and merchandisers said earlier this week USDA might act soon to reduce the cash corn price premium at the Gulf versus interior price levels by dropping ASCS posted prices to encourage interior PIK and roll movement But Sindt denied USDA is planning any such changes If people are suggesting that we are going to make wholesale changes in pricing we are not considering this he said Sindt however did not rule out the possiblity of implementing more minor changes in its pricing system We are continually monitoring the whole nationwide structure to maintain its accuracy he said If we become convinced that we need to make a change then appropriate adjustments will be made Sindt acknowledged that concern has been voiced that USDAs price differentials between the New Orleans Gulf and interior markets are not accurate because of higher than normal barge freight rates He said commodity operations deputy administrator Ralph Klopfenstein is currently in the midwest on a speaking tour and will meet with ASCS oficials in Kansas City next week Sindt said a number of issues will be discussed at that meeting including the current concern over the gulf corn premiums He defended the USDA differentials saying that these price margins reflect an average of prices throughout the year and that seasonal factors will normally cause prices to increase or decrease The USDA official also said that only those counties that use the Gulf to price grain are being currently affected by the high barge freight tariffs and increased gulf prices When asked if the USDA emergency storage program which allows grain to be stored in barges was taking up barge space and accounting for the higher freight rates Sindt discounted the idea He said USDA has grain left in only about 250 barges and that under provisions of the program these all have to be emptied by the end of March
7917	There are heightened fears that El Nino may be returning to Peru with an intensity approaching the 1983 disaster which affected the weather on several continents and caused widespread damage through floods and drought the US Agriculture Departments officer in Lima said in a field report Continued heavy rains in the northern coastal area flooding of several major rivers and mud slides have led to increased concern the report dated March 17 said However it said official sources still believe that this years El Nino will have only weak to moderate intensity EL Nino is a phenomenon involving a shift in winds and waters in the pacific The USDA report said that so far the El Nino now being experienced has not had an overall negative impact on agricultural production Excessive rains in the Piura Pima cotton area may reduce yields by about 20 pct due to excessive growth too early in the crop cycle Also insect damage to crops could be more extensive where excessive moisture exists it said However the El Nino has resulted in a much improved supply of irrigation water in the major dams which will improve prospects for many crucial crops such as rice and corn and slow the decline in sugar production it said If El Nino picks up momentum Perus fishing industry could receive a setback But trade sources still believe the fish catch for industrial processing will reach 55 mln tonnes in 1987 almost 20 pct above last year the report said Water temperatures in the northern fishing areas are three to four degrees centigrade above normal but still not high enough to drive the fish to cooler southern waters it said It said there is still the outside chance that El Nino will intensify and carry on through late March April and May causing problems as crops approach harvest There appears to be no way to project the course of El Nino -- only time will tell the report said
7934	The Soviet Unions winter grain crop is likely to have suffered losses due to dry planting conditions last fall and severe cold this winter an analyst of world weather and crop conditions said Grain analyst and meteorologist Gail Martell author of the EF Hutton publication Global Crop News said in her latest report that the Soviets may import more grain possibly wheat from the US due to potential crop damage Compared with last year the outlook for the Soviet winter grain crop is far more pessimistic she said But its still too early to talk about disastrous losses A lot will depend on spring weather not only for the outcome of the troubled winter grain crop but also for spring planting Martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probably prevented optimal seed germination for winter grains Key wheat growing areas of the southern Ukraine and North Caucasus received on 25-35 pct of autumn precipitation she said The bitter winter cold temperatures -- which broke record lows that had stood for four decades -- also may have taken its toll on Soviet winter crops she said However she noted that most of the southern grain belt had ample snow cover which should have well-insulated the majority of crop areas from severe frost damage The USSR has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grains in the July 1986June 1987 marketing year primarily from Canada the European Community Argentina and Australia Martell said She cited a number of reasons besides possible crop problems that might point to additional Soviet import demand Last falls dry weather may limit livestock grazing on moisture-depleted pastures while the cold winter weather necessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy Martell was also skeptical of a Soviet claim for a 1986 grain harvest of 210 mln tonnes and said the Chernobyl accident may have contaminated more grain than originally thought and have to be made up with imports However she said the US remains a supplier of last resort for the Soviet Union noting that the Soviets have only just recently begun their first US grain purchases of the 198687 season by buying 225 mln tonnes of corn Martell cited USDA statistics showing that since the 1980 grain embargo the US is only a major supplier of grain to the USSR during years of heavy Soviet demand In 198485 the US supplied 41 pct of record Soviet grain imports of 555 mln tonnes But in 198586 the Soviet Union bought 299 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the US for only 24 pct of that total While the USDA Soviet import target for grain for 198687 was 22 mln tonnes many US grain analysts have revised their estimates of Soviet imports up to 25-28 mln tonnes she said
8004	The US Agriculture Department formally transmitted to Congress a long-awaited proposal to drastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers for the cut with targeted income payments In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanying the Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987 Peter Myers Deputy Agriculture Secretary said the Reagan administration wants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning with the 1987 crop down from 18 cts now Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the government for the price support cut with targeted income payments over the four years 1988 to 1991 The payments would cost an estimated 11 billion dlrs Myers said The administration sugar proposal is expected to be introduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep John Porter R-Ill Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it is unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate because politically-influential sugar and corn growers and high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist The direct payment plan outlined by the administration targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually lowers payments over four years It also excludes from payment any output exceeding 20000 short tons raw sugar per grower For example on the first 350 tons of production a grower would receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988 45 cts in 1989 3 cts in 1990 and 15 cts in 1991 The income payments would be based on the amount of commercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985 or 1986 crop years whichever is less USDA said Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes in the sugar program because the current high price support is causing adverse trends in the sugar industry He said the current program has artificially stimulated domestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed corn sweeteners to make market inroads US sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a progressive contraction of the sugar import quota to only one mln short tons this year he said This has hurt cane sugar refiners who rely on imported sugar processing Furthermore USDA said the current sugar program gives overseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products a competitive advantage The result has been higher imports of sugar-containing products and a flight of US processing facilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on US consumers and industrial users In fiscal 1987 USDA said consumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than necessary for sugar Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap between sweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse impacts and trends which the sugar industry is currently facing Myers said The following table lists the rate of payments in cts per lb to growers and the quantity covered in short tons recoverable raw sugar under the administrations proposal to compensate sugar growers with targeted payments QUANTITY            1988     1989      1990      1991 First 350 tons         6000    4500     3000     1500 Over 350 to 700        5750    4313     2875     1438 Over 700 to 1000      5500    4125     2750     1375 Over 1000 to 1500    5000    3750     2500     1250 Over 1500 to 3000    4500    3375     2250     1125 Over 3000 to 6000    3500    2625     1750     0875 Over 6000 to 10000   2250    1688     1125     0563 Over 10000 to 20000  0500    0375     0250     0125 Over 20000 tons        nil      nil       nil       nil

8257	Rain over wide areas has raised the prospect of good food crops throughout Ethiopia which suffered a disastrous drought and famine two years ago Aweke Aynalem head of the governments Agriculture Development Department told reporters prospects were good for attaining the target of 250000 tonnes of grain in the present growing season one of two each year in Ethiopia Normal crop production in Ethiopia is about 648000 tonnes a year of which 250000 tonnes are produced from the belg small rains which fall at this time of year The belg rains are used to plant quick-maturing crops like maize and barley Any shortfall during this period affects production in the main rainy season because farmers eat their stocks of seed Aweke said peasants in Wello Tigre and Hararghe -- regions which suffered severely from drought -- were now able to sow their crops because of the favourable rains The government had distributed large quantities of seed and fertiliser and the rains should ensure a good crop
8273	Sen David Pryor D-Ark said he was considering amending the Senate Finance Committees trade bill with a provision to require a marketing loan for soybeans corn and wheat Pryor told the Futures Industry Association that there was great reluctance among members of the Senate Agriculture Committee to reopen the 1985 farm bill and that a marketing loan might have a better chance in the Finance panel The Arkansas senator said the marketing loan -- which in effect allows producers to pay back their crop loans at the world price -- had led to a 300 pct increase in US cotton exports in 14 months and a 72 pct increase in rice exports Pryor serves on both the Senate Finance and Agriculture Committees
8400	Portugals Agriculture Minister Alvaro Barreto said he disagreed with a court order barring the state grain buying agency EPAC from taking part in cereals import tenders open to private traders Barreto told reporters his aim was to have EPAC readmitted to the tenders Under the terms of Portugals January 1986 accession to the European Community EC a grain import monopoly held by EPAC Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990 Following legal proceedings by private importers Lisbons civil court decided in a preliminary ruling earlier this month that EPAC should not be allowed to take part as it had done in tenders for the liberalised share of annual grain imports As a result of this ruling EPAC was excluded from a March 12 tender for the import of 80000 tonnes of maize Barreto said My objective is put EPAC into the tenders because it has a right to take part He added the government would be studying the court order to see whether or not the ruling could stop EPAC from participating in future tenders Barreto said there was no reason to exclude any operator whether public or private from the tenders Private traders had argued that EPAC given its dominant position in the Portuguese grain market had an unfair advantage over them There is no reason to make EPAC a martyr of the system Barreto said He said the ECs executive commission had accepted the governments view that EPAC should be eligible The Lisbon court ruling stated that EPACs participation in the public tenders was unfair competition and violated the clauses of Portugals EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual dismantling of the state agencys import monopoly
8446	The EC Commission will decide shortly precisely how to arrange the import of third country maize and sorghum into the EC in fulfilment of its agreement with the United States Commission sources said Under the accord reached following US complaints about the impact on its agricultural exports of Spanish EC membership the EC will import two mln tonnes of maize and 300000 tonnes of sorghum a year up to end of 1990 All this produce will be imported into Spain at special levy levels likely to be below those applying for imports into other EC countries The sources said it was possible that the Spanish intervention board would be asked to buy the produce directly this year as it was rather late to make other arrangements They added that the choice for future years appears to lie between a system of regular tenders and the setting of a daily special levy applicable to Spanish imports There will initially be no tax on re-exports of maize and sorghum from Spain to other EC countries although such a tax could be imposed later the sources added
8535	US Agriculture undersecretary Dan Amstutz indicated the United States is willing talk with the Soviet Union about the competitiveness of US wheat prices but would not discuss making US wheat prices cheap There sometimes is a difference between being competitive and being cheap Amstutz told a Senate Agriculture Appropriations hearing Amstutz said the difference of opinion between Moscow and Washington last summer on the level of the US subsidy offered on wheat to the Soviet Union was over whether the US wheat price was competitive or cheap I think there is a US willingness to explore this issue as it pertains to competitiveness Amstutz said However Amstutz added that the United States would not be willing to discuss wheat prices with Moscow if the issue is being cheap Asked later by a reporter what he meant by the distinction between competitive and cheap Amstutz would not elaborate Amstutz said it is the US judgment that the long-term grain agreement between the two countries calls for Moscow to buy at least four mln tonnes each of wheat and corn annually at prices in effect in this country Amstutz made the comments in response to a question from Sen Charles Grassley R-Iowa about expanding the export enhancement program to include grain sales to the Soviet Union

9058	US corn acreage this year is likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassed acreage reductions of the 1983 PIK year and could rank as one of the lowest corn plantings in the United States in sixty years Agriculture Department officials said USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31 Agriculture Department analysts said next weeks figures will likely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres down 22 pct from last years plantings of 833 mln acres Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings US corn production will also decrease significantly Analysts said 1987 corn production could drop by over one billion bushels to around seven billion bushels Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grains program along with 19 mln acres enrolled in the conservation program will cause acreage to plummet Department feedgrain analysts said Theres no question that there will be a sharp decrease in corn acreage one said Its difficult for any farmer to not go along with the program this year Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year but at a much slower rate of around four pct USDA analysts said Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below they said compared to last years level of 615 mln acres If analysts unofficial estimates prove correct then the drop in us corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 when farmers idled 22 mln acres in the Payment-In-Kind program Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983 A severe drought that summer in major producing states caused yields to tumble and final crop production to total only 42 billion bushels Given normal weather conditions this year USDA analysts said the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billion bushels down from last years crop of 83 billion bushels This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significant reduction in production an analyst said A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual US corn usage so surplus stocks while not decreasing would not increase significantly a specialist said High producing corn belt states are expected to show the greatest acreage reductions based upon historical participation in government programs analysts said In contrast soybean acreage is likely to be cut the most in marginal producing areas of the southeast and the western corn belt a USDA soybean analyst said Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge he said Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts in higher-producing delta areas Soybean production could drop fractionally from last years 20 billion bushels to 18 to 19 billion he said US soybean acreage after soaring to 714 mln acres in 1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that has steadily declined in the 1980s US corn acreage with the exception of 1983 has been in the low to mid 80-mln acre range for the past 10 years The highest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA has kept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mln acres and obtained average yields of 265 bushels per acre Last year US farmers obtained record corn yields averaging 1193 bushels per acre We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billion bushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so an analyst said Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres as long as government program provisions remain the same analysts said Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required to set aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligible for payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15 pct of their acreage To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres we would have to provide more incentives an analyst said

9470	A leading US farm-state Congressman Jerry Huckaby D-La warned he will press next year for legislation to control domestic production of sweeteners perhaps including corn sweeteners if the industry fails to voluntarily halt output increases this year Were moving toward a direction where we could self-destruct the US sugar program Rep Huckaby chairman of the House agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar issues told Reuters in an interview Huckaby who told US sugarbeet growers earlier this year they must halt production increases said he will deliver the same message to Louisiana sugarcane growers Friday He also said he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject Huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domestic sweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further cuts in the sugar import quota now at one mln short tons I think if were talking about dropping the quota another half mln tons lets say youre getting to the point where the program might not work he said Ideally Id like to freeze things right where we are said Huckaby leading advocate for sugar growers in Congress A freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about the current level of 65 mln tons the corn sweetener share of the US market staying at just over 50 pct and US sugar imports holding at about 12 mln tons Huckaby said A decision on whether to seek legislation will not be made until 1987 output numbers are known late this year he said I feel like if we didnt expand production we could probably hold where we are indefinitely or at least through the 1985 farm bill without any changes in the sugar program Huckaby said However much depends on whether high-fructose corn syrup producers continue to expand their share of the US sweetener market from just over 50 pct Huckaby said He noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners will capture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market in the US But he said if there were an economic breakthrough in the production of a new crystalline corn sweetener which further expanded the corn sweetener share then US sugar imports might be eliminated and US sugar output severely reduced Huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refiner companies such as AE Staley and Archer Daniels Midland soon This program is advantageous to the corn users They have some natural legitimate self-interest in seeing that the program is preserved Huckaby said Huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to think about how domestic output could be controlled either through production allocations acreage or marketing controls Huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the Justice Department to determine if it would be legal to ask corn refiners to limit production I dont know if we will go this route but if we do theres a question in my mind at this point in time can you do that legally he said Asked if he would proceed with production controls without the support of corn refiners Huckaby said You build a fragile house if you do it that way Huckaby said he understands why US cane and beet farmers have expanded production because high sugar price support means returns from sugar are higher than competing crops such as soybeans and grain But he said for sugar growers as a whole expansion would not be good policy Huckaby said he has tried to stress in his speeches to sugar industry groups that if growers continue to expand they may be penalized retroactively under any production control legislation passed next year Huckaby said Congress is unlikely to approve any changes in the sugar program this year despite a Reagan administration proposal to drastically slash the program The administration proposal is so drastic that I dont think it will get up a head of steam Huckaby said He said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar price support is unlikely to be approved Instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program Huckaby said the Reagan administration should file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against the European Communitys sugar policy He said EC policies are the major cause of the depressed world sugar market
9521	Argentine grain producers again reduced their estimates for the total yield of the 198687 soybean crop which will begin to be harvested in mid-April trade sources said They said growers now forecast soybean production this season at between 75 and 78 mln tonnes down from last weeks estimate of 77 to eight mln tonnes and the 80 to 84 mln tonnes forecast in mid-February The new forecast is still higher than last seasons record total production Private sources put 198586 production at a record 72 to 73 mln tonnes -- 42 to 64 pct lower than the new forecast for the current crop The official figure for 198586 is 71 mln tonnes 56 to 99 pct below this seasons new estimates Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean pods in the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe provinces and northern Buenos Aires The crop since January has been hit by high temperatures and inadequate rainfall Growers fear they may find more empty pods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 37 to 38 mln hectares 108 to 138 pct higher than the 198586 record of 334 mln hectares The state of the crop continued to be good in general until last week but intense heavy rains since could have caused damage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm Where the rains were less heavy they were considered beneficial although too late to improve yield estimates The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops in southern Buenos Aires province but are not expected to influence production forecasts In other areas especially western Buenos Aires where rainfall was more than 200 mm parts of the sunflower maize and sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week by rains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba La Pampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios The area sown with maize this season was between 358 and 378 mln hectares two to seven pct less than the 385 mln hectares in 198586 The yield of 198687 maize continued to be forecast at between 99 and 101 mln tonnes This estimate is 198 to 202 pct lower than the 124 to 126 mln tonnes at which private sources put 198586 production and 211 to 227 pct lower than the official 128 mln tonnes The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of the area sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Aires although at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage is impossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days of sunshine dries the fields The area sown this season was 20 to 22 mln hectares down 299 to 363 pct on last years record 314 mln hectares Sunflowerseed 198687 production is still forecast at 23 to 26 mln tonnes 341 to 415 pct below the 198586 record of 41 mln tonnes The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by the rains advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and starting in La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown The area sown was 123 to 130 mln hectares 103 to 152 pct less than the 145 mln hectares the previous season Yield estimates remained at 32 to 35 mln tonnes 167 to 22 pct down on 198586 production of 41 to 42 mln tonnes
9667	Congress eager to find budget savings launches a review of the US Agriculture Departments generic commodity certificate program tomorrow amid signs USDA and the General Accounting Office GAO are at odds over how much the program has cost US taxpayers The GAO concluded in a preliminary report last week that payment-in-kind or PIK certificates cost between five and 20 pct more than cash outlays administration officials who asked not to be identified said USDA officials however took issue with the report saying it did not take into account storage handling and transport savings that accrue to the government The GAO then decided to re-examine the costs sources said The issue is an important one because congressional budget committees are known to be considering limiting the use of certificates as a means of cutting spending Agriculture Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley are set to testify before the Senate Agriculture Committee tomorrow Amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there are uncertainties in determining the cost of certificates compared to cash outlays and that savings to the Commodity Credit Corp CCC almost equal costs department sources said USDA estimates that it costs the government about 75 cents to store handle and transport each bushel of commodity put in government storage It was unclear whether the GAO Congress investigative arm would stick by its original analysis that it costs the government more to use certificates instead of cash in farm price and income support programs Reagan administration sources said The GAO is expected to point out that use of payment-in-kind PIK certificates has helped relieve tight storage by moving grain that otherwise might not have been sold The testimony by Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley comes as congressional budget committees intensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federal budget deficit -- including considering limits on the use of PIK certificates The CCC issues dollar-denominated PIK certificates or certs as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays to farmers or cash subsidies to exporters Certs can be used to repay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities or cash Between April and December 1986 CCC issued 38 billion dlrs worth of certificates according to USDA Up to another 67 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January and August 1987 according to USDA Certs can cost the government more than cash primarily because recipients can use the certificates to pay back government loans at levels below the loan rate Eliminating this practice called PIK and roll would save the government 14 billion dlrs between 1988-92 according to the Congressional Budget Office CBO That estimate according to a CBO official was based on an assumption that certificates cost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to be considering curbs on PIK-and-roll transactions among other savings alternatives The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that the estimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to date have cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mln dlrs or between five and 20 pct more than cash outlays one administration official said However the GAO has decided to reassess those estimates based in part on USDA criticism department officials said The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributable to the different effect certificates can have on market prices over the course of a crop year USDAs Economic Research Service for example has found that between June and August last year the 215 mln bushels of corn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn by between 35 and 45 cents per bushel Between September and November however certificates had only a marginal impact on corn prices according to the ERS study obtained by Reuters
