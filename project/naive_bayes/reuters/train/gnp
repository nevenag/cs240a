179	Switzerlands economy combining low unemployment financial stability and a large external payments surplus is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory future the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD said This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government it said The OECD in its annual report on Switzerland picked out some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in inflation this year but said these gave no cause for concern The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product growth to 175 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986 and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 125 pct after last years sharp fall to 075 pct from 36 pct in 1985 But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest increase in the workforce leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at around one pct the lowest in the 24-industrial nation OECD area Assuming an average exchange rate of 171 Swiss francs to the dollar this year against 169 in the second half of 1986 the report forecast a 275 pct rise in exports and a 35 pct rise in imports this year after rises of 325 pct and 65 pct respectively in 1986 The faster growth of imports compared with exports this year and last reflecting buoyant private consumption meant that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP would shrink in both years But given Switzerlands large external surplus there should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than GDPWhich if only in a small way would contribute to improving international balances the OECD said Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually buoyant last year with a 325 pct growth rate after several years of relative weakness it noted In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat to a 225 pct growth rate but should still outstrip overall GDP it added The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained bright into 1987 and with capacity use at near record levels last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation in both the industry and service sectors it said As a consequence growth in machinery and equipment investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year after vigorous growth in 1986 But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for tourism and the banking industry two major service sector earners of foreign exchange The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc and the accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets could lead to a loss of international market share for both it said Particularly for the banks recent developments in international financial markets give rise to the question whether the Swiss financial system which has shown substantial flexibility in the past is adapting itself at the speed required  To preserve its competitive position it said
209	Frances right wing government is facing growing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising down its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflation forecasts for this year Moving reluctantly into line with most private sector forecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflation estimate a half percentage point to 25 per cent and cut its economic growth estimate to between two and 28 per cent from a 28 per cent target written into the annual budget last september Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figures would not push the government off its chosen mix of price deregulation budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they would push to protect the purchasing power of their members raising the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believed Prime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growth and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year perhaps in the autumn to boost his prospects in Presidential elections due by April 1988 The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais We have the impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth this year The big question is whether the governments policy of wage moderation will be maintained he added The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout 17 per cent this year with a three per cent ceiling for rises justified by increased productivity But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation Edmond Maire meeting with Chirac today renewed union demands already rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher prices Calling the governments policies unbalanced and unjust he also demanded investment incentives to boost employment He announced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the government would spend two billion francs on a series of measures to boost employment and training Andre Bergeron a widely respected leader of the moderate Force Ouvriere labour group put similar demands to Chirac earlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT the largest of Frances unions declared the defence of its members earnings its top priority But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month and still rising government supporters and some economic analysts said they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist government and I dont think this administration is going to reverse that commented Michel Develle economist at recently-privatised Banque Paribas Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas and the New Year partly blamed by the government for higher inflation had undermined the unions power and popularity he said Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more than the governments revised forecast perhaps to 26 or 27 per cent this year against last years 21 per cent But that would still be an exceptional achievement considering that for the first time since the Second World War all french prices have been freed he commented Finance Ministry officials said that the governments abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible for nearly a quarter of a 09 per cent surge in January living costs But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should have no knock-on impact on the rest of the year Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that so long as the government kept wages under control Prices could rise 15 per cent in the first three months of 1987 and two per cent in the first half year fractionally more than forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute INSEE  Marais said But the second half year should be better he added Ironically one side effect of higher inflation could be to help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget deficit several analysts said So long as public sector wages are held down higher Value Added Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than expected growth they said
227	Domestic demand is now expected to make no contribution to Australian economic growth in fiscal 198687 ending June 30 while net exports will account for all of the overall increase Treasurer Paul Keating said here However he did not say in his speech to the Economic Planning Advisory Council EPAC if the forecast 225 pct rise in gross domestic product gdp had been revised But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly this financial year and net export growth will provide the total source of gdp growth The August budget had forecast domestic demand would contribute 075 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 25 pct while net exports would account for 175 points Keating said the overall impact of the changed economic parameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to a slightly more rapid correction in the current account deficit than first anticipated The government initially forecast a current account deficit for 198687 of 1475 billion -- our present expectation is that the result will be somewhat lower around 14 billion he said Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPAC in December indicate that the 198687 budget strategy is broadly on track Keating said They indicate that domestic demand has been a little more sluggish than was expected at budget time he said On the other hand net exports seem to be expanding by more than expected at budget time and this is underpinning growth in domestic production and employment Keating said it now seems likely that the 198687 inflation rate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct Nevertheless there is likely to be a marked slowing in inflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetary effects wane he said Keating said the government expects economic growth to pick up moderately in 198788 due to a further significant rise in net exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from private domestic demand He said domestic demand growth will be due to a strengthening in real household disposable income The moderate rise in economic growth next financial year should be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a level broadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year The current account deficit will continue to show improvement in 198788 Keating said As the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recent years recede further and given continued effective wage restraint inflation should moderate markedly in 198788 he said
843	French industry is failing to produce the goods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the economy the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said With gross domestic product likely to grow only 21 pct this year the same rate as last year unemployment could climb to 115 pct of the workforce by mid-1988 from its present 109 pct it said in an annual review of the French economy The report said the French economy was increasingly ill-adapted to demand selling goods at uncompetitive relative prices on both domestic and export markets Frances poor export performance reflects a geographical bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average AndA substantial loss of market shareIn the past 18 months it said Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit to around 29 billion dlrs this year from 24 billion in 1986 it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the franc could lead to a renewed loss of competitiveness relative not only to the United States but also to the newly industrialised countries This could result in further major losses of market share particularly in the non-OECD area which accounts for almost a quarter of French exports it said Until the competitive ability of industry improved the authorities would have little scope for macroeconomic manoeuvre even if the unemployment situation or the need to encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow more briskly it added But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage demands contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a two pct annual rate this year and early next the OECD said Written mainly in December last year the report took no account of a rise in oil prices early in 1987 and a 09 pct surge in January consumer prices caused partly by the governments deregulation of service sector tariffs We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke runaway rises and it is not absolutely certain that bet has been lost one OECD official commented OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil prices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the report indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast to around 25 or three pct The government last week revised its forecast up to between 24 and 25 pct from two pct against last years 21 pct But the OECD backed the governments view that the underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last years fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of disinflation With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in the OECD area the inflation differential between France and its main trading rival West Germany could fall to just one pct this year it said On the other hand the report noted consumer prices for industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply as companies built up their profits For the disinflationary process to continue  and price competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange rate stability it is essential that wage restraint continue it said
1068	Canadas real gross domestic product seasonally adjusted rose 11 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 the same as the growth as in the previous quarter Statistics Canada said That left growth for the full year at 31 pct which is down from 1985s four pct increase The rise was also slightly below the 33 pct growth rate Finance Minister Michael Wilson predicted for 1986 in Februarys budget He also forecast GDP would rise 28 pct in 1987 Statistics Canada said final domestic demand rose 06 pct in the final three months of the year after a 10 pct gain in the third quarter Business investment in plant and equipment rose 08 pct in the fourth quarter partly reversing the cumulative drop of 58 pct in the two previous quarters
1102	Canadas gross domestic product by industry rose a seasonally adjusted 12 pct in December the largest monthly gain since April 1986 Statistics Canada said GDP which fell 02 pct in November was 21 pct above the December 1985 level the federal agency said Output of goods producing industries rose 16 pct in the month with virtually all the growth occurring in manufacturing and mining Services producing industries expanded 10 pct
1272	Canadian economic growth is expected to slow further in 1987 but an improved the trade picture should keep the country from recession economists said The economy is ready for about a 20 pct rate of growth over the course of 1987 said Carl Beigie Chief Economist at Dominion Securities Pitfield Ltd Statistics Canada reported that gross domestic product grew 31 pct in 1986 the fourth year of continuous expansion but down from 1985s four pct In the final quarter GDP in 1981 prices and at annualized rates rose a slight 02 pct after expanding 08 pct in the third quarter Essentially it is a flat performance said Warren Jestin deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia Economist Wendy Smith Cork of the brokerage Nesbitt Thomson Bongard Inc said it shows the economy is not moving along very steadily its not a very promising number We werent surprised we expected to see one bad quarter in Canada but we dont think there will be a recession she added The rise in GDP was below the 33 pct increase forecast by Federal Finance Minister Michael Wilson in his budget last month He also projected the economy would expand  28 pct this year Many economists are less optimistic predicting growth will likely be in the 20 to 22 pct range Statistics Canada also reported the countrys trade performance deteriorated sharply last year as the deficit in the current account rose to a record 88 billion Canadian dlrs from the previous years shortfall of 584 mln dlrs The sharp increase in the deficit originated from merchandise trade transactions where imports continued to advance strongly whereas exports were virtually unchanged the federal agency said in a statement The merchandise trade surplus was pared to 1013 billion dlrs in 1986 from 1748 billion dlrs in 1985 But economist Cork said the expected upturn in the US economy will lead to increased demand for Canadian goods and help fuel the countrys modest expansion Nearly 80 pct of Canadas exports are shipped to the US each year
1611	Turkey expects a 1986 balance of payments deficit of 15 billion dlrs well over target but is taking steps to improve its performance in this and other fields Ali Tigrel director of economic planning at the State Planning Organisation said He told Reuters the shortfall was a direct consequence of economic growth of nearly eight pct up from 51 pct in 1985 which he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after a drop of more than 12 points to 246 pct in the Treasury wholesale index last year This years target of 20 pct might be attainable but the economic management will have to be careful he said Tigrel whose department produces the annual programme which is central to the governments economic planning said Turkeys creditworthiness was at risk over the current account shortfall originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs We must alleviate the current account substantially to sustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure over the last five years he added His comment echoed last Octobers Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report on Turkey which said Ankaras case for more medium-term financing on better terms would look better if inflation were lower and the current account deficit cut or turned into a surplus In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sector investments we must reduce the public sector deficit as a percentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visible improvement in the current account deficit he said Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year was also to blame for the high deficits Appropriations to government departments had been cut by eight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreign borrowing by municipalities had been restrained We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to the investment programme and do not exceed their appropriations he said It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing requirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated 56 pct in 1986 More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was also targeted Tigrel said Measures were being taken to encourage exports and production incentives were being considered We must try to make sure that more capacity is injected into the Turkish economy in the coming years The promotion policy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and local private capital come more into play as far as manufacturing capacity is concerned Tigrel said He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkish economy to free market policies begun in 1980 was still under way Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate policy applied but he acknowledged there was more to be done in a country where the state still dominates industry and the currency is only partially convertible
1858	Bank of Canada Governor John Crow said he expects the Canadian economy will grow moderately in the coming year despite the near flat growth in the final quarter of 1986 We see moderate growth Crow told a news conference following presentation of the central banks annual report in the House of Commons today He said there were positive signs of growth in the economy particularly the drawdown of business inventories in the fourth quarter Yesterday Statistics Canada reported gross domestic product expanded a slight 02 pct in the quarter Crow reiterated the banks previous statements that inflation remains a major priority in setting monetary policy and said only zero inflation would be acceptable Canadas inflation rate is currently hovering around the four pct mark The governor said Canadas banking system remains sound despite recent concern about exposure by the countrys banks in debt plagued countries such as Brazil It the debt problem is not a happy development but I think it can be overplayed in terms of its impact Crow told reporters
1959	The outlook for the West German economy is relatively bright with gross national product expected to expand by three pct this year Kiel Universitys Institute for World Economy said The GNP forecast by the institute one of five leading economic research bodies in West Germany is more optimistic than that of the other institutes some of which have recently reduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 25 pct In a report the Kiel institute said West Germanys export outlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the marks strength against the dollar and other major currencies The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears all in all limited the report said On the contrary a slight rise in exports can be expected The institute said past experience has shown West German exporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by cutting costs trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting their product ranges They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in economic growth in industrial countries At the same time the decline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow this year West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed advances in domestic consumption and investment spending both of which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary policy the institute said However it said the labour market would see only a slight improvement because companies will be reluctant to hire additional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by agreed reductions in working hours The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of monetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked acceleration of inflation It also warned that what it called the worldwide synchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new global recession It said central banks in industrialized countries including the Bundesbank had followed the Federal Reserve Boards expansionary course The institute said this in turn was bound to lead eventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in US Policy towards a more restrictive policy Other central banks were likely to follow suit causing a recession that could aggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as increase protectionism around the world Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from the negative effects of the global synchronization of monetary policy it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of growth at home The institute said this could be done by ensuring that fiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest Taxes should be cut by a greater amount than currently planned and wage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than in 1986 It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationary pressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supply to about four pct
10135	Extracts from a report by Italys Budget Ministry on the countrys economic development in 1986 showed gross domestic product GDP 27 pct higher in real terms than in 1985 but a rise in unemployment GDP calculated at 1980 prices rose to 434682 billion lire last year from 423064 billion in 1985 On a current prices basis GDP was up 11 pct totalling 894362 billion lire in 1986 against 805754 billion in 1985 But growth was insufficient to prevent a rise in unemployment to 111 pct last year from 103 pct in 1985 the ministry said The report said falling oil prices and the depreciation of the dollar during 1986 had favoured oil-importing countries such as Italy These factors helped Italy cut inflation to an average 63 pct in 1986 down from 93 pct in 1985 They also helped a major improvement in the trade balance On the basis of data recently recalculated by the national statistics institute Istat Italy had a trade deficit in 1986 of 3722 billion lire the report said This slightly revises a previous deficit figure of 3717 billion issued by Istat and compares with a negative balance of 23085 billion for 1985
10289	South Korea plans to increase the size of its budget in 1988 by 11 to 12 pct from this years 15596 billion won Economic Planning Board officials said The proposed boost is based on a government forecast that gross national product gnp will grow by more than 75 pct and the gnp deflator by 35 pct in 1988 against targets of 80 pct and 35 pct respectively this year they said Details of the 1988 budget in which spending will match revenue have yet to be worked out the officials said The balanced budget in 1986 totalled 138005 billion won
10340	Italys gross domestic product GDP will grow three pct in real terms this year and 27 pct in 1988 said economic information company Data Resources Europe Inc DRI Michel Girardin DRI Europes senior economist said at a conference that Italian GDP growth this year will be mainly driven by consumption and especially investment Girardin said the driving force behind GDP growth next year will shift from domestic demand to exports as a result of expected depreciation of the lira against the major currencies Italys budget ministry said yesterday that GDP rose 27 pct in real terms in 1986 DRI forecast that inflation which was an average 63 pct in 1986 will be under five pct this year and that interest rates should drop two pct Girardin said the lira is expected to appreciate 14 pct against the dollar this year following last years 22 pct appreciation An expected German mark appreciation against the dollar means that the lira should lose about six pct of its value relative to the German currency he said DRI estimates that foreign demand for Italian products should grow by a 32 pct this year following last years 62 pct increase
10531	The South African Reserve Bank confirming previous estimates said real gross domestic product in the 1986 fourth quarter grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 47 pct versus 46 pct in the third quarter and 13 pct in the 1985 final quarter The bank in its latest quarterly review said the nominal growth rate for the year did not quite reach one pct after a 15 pct contraction in 1985 But it said when the strengthening of the terms of trade is taken into account the real GNP in 1986 advanced by 15 pct compared with a decrease of 05 pct in 1985 GDP is the total value of goods and services produced by an economy but omits income from abroad  GNP includes such payments or outflows The bank also said there were indications the countrys economic recovery was becoming more broadly based With the exception of commerce all major sectors of the economy contributed to the fourth quarter rise in domestic production The bank said major increases in foreign reserves were recorded in January February and the first half of March 1987 Reserves rose by 170 billion rand during January and February Total reserves in 1986 declined by 189 mln rand to 570 billion rand and were equivalent to about 145 pct of the total annual value of import payments The current account surplus amounted to 720 billion rand in 1986 versus 590 mln the previous year The bank said continuing strength of the current account has allowed foreign reserves to be rebuilt to more comfortable levels This has strengthened the authorities hands in lending support to the exchange rate of the rand if such action were to be called for the bank said
10827	Canadas gross domestic product rose 01 pct seasonally adjusted in January after gaining 10 pct in December but falling 01 pct and 03 pct in November and October Statistics Canada said Januarys rise in 1981 prices was fueled largely by a 05 pct gain in the goods producing sector Output in services-producing industries declined 01 pct from Decembers level Januarys level was 129 pct higher than the same month a year ago The federal agency said it was the second straight gain for goods producing industries Most of the growth occurred in manufacturing and construction Within manufacturing strong gains were posted in the wood machinery non-metallic mineral and food product groups Significant declines were recorded in the output of automobiles and parts however In the services sector increases in finance insurance and communication were more than offset by declines in transportation storage and the retail trade
11083	The Federal Reserves move to easier monetary policy begun with four quick half-point discount rate cuts in 1986 will likely end with a final rate drop in the second quarter analysts said A poll of 10 economists shows most expect interest rates to edge lower with the Fed likely to drop its basic lending rate from 5-12 pct late next quarter to help the economy The Fed is not likely to ease policy much further without a full-blown recession said Raymond Stone chief financial economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Stone said economic data available by late June may be just weak enough to prompt one more discount rate cut But he said it may only be a quarter-point drop instead of the usual half point to avoid hurting the dollar further All of the economists agreed that the Federal Open Market Committee tomorrow will leave Fed policy unchanged The average forecast of those surveyed projects roughly quarter-point drops by the end of June in both the Treasury bond yield to 7-12 pct and the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another to 5-78 pct Most expect the prime lending rate at major banks to remain at 7-12 pct Other broad predictions of the survey relating mainly to the April-June quarter follow - The dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct further against other major currencies because of a large US budget deficit and a wide but narrowing trade gap Contacted after the dollars steep drop in the last two business days the economists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is that the dollar will fall more rather than less than they expect - Oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continue trading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs a barrel and could well test the lower end of that range - Stocks will continue to outperform bonds next quarter and probably for all of 1987 Stocks should gain on strong foreign demand and a modest second-half economic rise The outlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the year since both inflation and interest rates may be edging up - Inflation as measured by the GNP implicit price deflator will rise to around 33 pct this year from 27 pct in 1986 The sharp fall in the dollar to date will add to inflation as will a mild economic pickup in the second half of this year - US real gross national product which grew at a two pct annual rate in the 1986 second half should expand at respective rates of about 23 pct and 25 pct in the 1987 first and second halves First-quarter growth is put at a 24 pct annual rate slowing to 21 pct next quarter Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International sees both the strongest economy and the highest interest rates among those surveyed He expects real GNP which grew at a 11 pct rate in fourth-quarter 1986 to expand at a 33 pct rate this quarter and 35 pct next quarter The economy will bounce back more strongly than many expect Brusca said He said an involuntary buildup in inventories largely in autos will add to first-quarter economic growth with consumer spending helping later Were running out of special factors to keep the economy afloat said Philip Braverman of Irving Securities Corp His interest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest Braverman said tax law changes and inventory accumulation helped lift fourth and first quarter GNP growth respectively He expects 25 pct first quarter growth but said that second quarter growth could be zero or negative Braverman said economic activity next quarter will suffer from a paring of inventories lower capital investment slow government spending and less construction Only a marginally narrower trade deficit will add to growth He sees a 710 pct end-of-June yield on Treasury bonds with Federal funds and prime rates at 550 and seven pct respectively Nikkos Brusca projects rates of 825 pct for bonds 615 pct for funds and 775 pct for the prime rate Two of the 10 economists revised rate forecasts up mildly after the dollars fall to 40-year lows versus the yen in past days and news of pending US trade sanctions against Japan David Resler of Nomura Securities Co International Inc raised his end-June bond yield forecast to 750 pct from 720 pct and a Fed funds rate estimate to six pct from 580 pct Raul Nicho president of Money Market Services Inc lifted his forecast of bond and Fed funds rates an eighth of a point to eight pct for bonds and 6-14 pct for funds Both Nicho and Resler left their end-June prime rate forecast at 7-12 pct The higher rate forecasts reflected a belief that Japanese investors will be less eager to buy US bonds because of fear about further dollar erosion and perhaps in response to US trade sanctions Yields may have to rise to lure other buyers END-JUNE US INTEREST RATE FORECASTS T-bondsFed fundsPrime Nikko Securities825615775 Money Mkt Services800625750 Discount Corp775625750 Merrill Lynch730575750 Bankers Trust725550750 Wells Fargo Bank730560700 Irving Securities710550700 Dean Witter700550700 FORECAST AVERAGE7505875750 CURRENT LEVELS7806125750
11191	Finlands gross national product is expected to rise by three pct in 1987 against two pct in 1986 and inflation will be unchanged at about 35 pct the private business survey office ETLA predicted Unemployment in 1987 is put at 55 pct in line with last year the office predicted in its regular review The balance of payments would show a five billion markka deficit in 1987 against a 42 billion deficit in 1986
11291	The Institute for Economic Research WIFO said it has cut its forecast for Austrias 1987 gross domestic product growth to a real one pct from a two pct forecast made last December WIFO chief Helmut Kramer told a new conference that he saw the one pct figure which compares with 18 pct last year as the upper limit of growth The institute had made the revision due to poor prospects for Austrian exports he added A collapse in sales to the Eastern European and oil producing states combined with the effects of the dollars fall mean exports overall are unlikely to rise this year Kramer said domestic demand alone would fuel growth this year After last years 28 pct rise in real incomes private consumption was likely to rise 225 pct in 1987 after 19 pct in 1986 despite a present trend towards higher savings Unemployment was likely to rise to almost six pct from 52 pct last year due to the slack economic activity Kramer said the current account was likely to run a deficit of about four billion schillings compared with a 26 billion surplus recorded last year The National Bank Austrias central bank last month forecast the current account would be roughly in balance this year However Kramer said the lower economic growth should have no notable effect on the governments attempts to cut the budget deficit This years aim of reducing the deficit to 49 pct of GDP from 51 pct in 1986 could still be achieved he said
11327	Australia faces a major medium term adjustment to reduce debt and improve its economic performance the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said in its latest annual review of the Australian economy It said Australia had a current external deficit of 5-34 pct of gross domestic product high and rapidly rising external debt equal to 30 pct of GDP growing servicing costs and inflation above nine pct far higher than that of other OECD countries A major policy change in early 1985 helped lay the basis for sustained non-inflationary growth and external competitiveness had improved but economic performance overall had sharply deteriorated since June 1985 A major shift of real resources to the external sector --about 4-12 pct of GDP by 1990-91 -- was required for the economy to expand in line with potential for employment to grow and for the debtGDP ratio to stabilize it said Success depended on the setting of right policies including tighter fiscal policy a reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement and on private sector behaviour Looking ahead over the next 18 months the OECD expected economic performance to improve partly as a result of tighter fiscal and monetary policy and a substantial improvement in trade volumes It said positive GDP growth of three pct might be restored the current external deficit could fall to some 4-12 pct of GDP by the first half of next year while inflation was projected to decelerate to around five to 5-12 pct by mid-1988 Continued real wage moderation was essential to maintain the competitive edge created by the Australian dollars depreciation and to maintain if not boost profit shares in order to encourage business investment The report urged Australia to broaden its export base by developing viable and competitive service and manufacturing industries and not count on a recovery of commodity markets to correct its external imbalances It added Australia should reduce protection levels in manufacturing even though faster trade liberalisation would no doubt hurt the most protected sectors of industry
11356	Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said a 07 pct rise in Februarys index of leading indicators pointed to stronger economic growth in the first half of 1987 In a statement commenting on the rise last month after a 05 pct January decline Baldrige noted the leading index was rising at an 80 pct annual rate in the six months to the end of February Based on past relationships that gain is consistent with stepped up growth in real GNP during the first half of 1987 Baldrige said
11776	The Bundesbank should take further steps to reduce German interest rates to protect the mark from further appreciation and to persuade investors to bring long-term yields lower Commerzbank AG ltCBKGF management board chairman Walter Seipp said But he told the banks annual news conference this did not mean a cut in leading interest rates rather a reduction in money market rates through bringing the allocation rates down for Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements Leading interest rates are not the decisive rates he said The money market rates are the important ones Seipp said the Bundesbank should move away from allocating money market liquidity at a fixed 38 pct as it has in recent tender allocations An easier monetary policy would not mean a loss of credibility for the Bundesbank in its containment of monetary growth A fall in short rates would make the public aware of the high yields in bonds and lead to a longer-term capital formation braking the expansion of money supply Thus you can have lower rates and also a normalisation of monetary growth both at the same time he added Seipp said there were no grounds to paint too black a picture of the German economy since company profitability had improved over recent years and domestic oriented firms were profiting from cheaper imports because of the rise in the mark Growth this year should be at least one pct he said describing the downturn in production in the first months as a false start unrepresentative of the rest of the year After an economic contraction in the first quarter the economy should show an uptrend in the last three We dont believe that the economy has tipped over but see it more as a growth dip Seipp said But Seipp also called for support for growth from fiscal policy saying the top rate of income and corporate tax should be brought down to 49 pct The current peak rate is 56 pct The additional tax cuts brought forward to next January were no substitute for support for growth Seipp added the federal government should make further courageous steps to decrease the states proportion of the German economy and to increase its flexibility

2709	The Belgian government which introduced large-scale public spending reductions last year has been told by an International Monetary Fund team there is scope for further cuts in 1988 The suggestion is contained in the preliminary conclusions of the annual IMF consultations with Belgium on its economic policy a copy of which was distributed to journalists at the weekly press conference following meetings of the cabinet The IMF team also urges Belgium to adopt a firm interest rate policy with a particular emphasis on long-term rates The teams report to the government praises last years spending cuts which are due to reduce 1987 government spending by 195 billion francs and says 1986 saw the Belgian economy perform better on a broader basis than at any time so far in the 1980s However it adds that with lower inflation stabilisation of the debt to gross national product ratio requires a much lower budget deficit than the seven pct of GNP target the government has set itself for 1989 The governments net financing requirement was 110 pct of GNP in 1986 The report says The most that can be afforded over the next few years is a zero growth of real non-interest expenditure of general Government It says there is a need for a revision of the Belgian tax system to iron out distortions and meet hopes of a reduced tax burden but substantial progress is needed in stabilising the debt to GNP ratio before this is possible Because of the difficulty of sustaining zero expenditure growth and of likely growing impatience for tax reductions we feel that your position would be stronger if you could decide on rather sharp expenditure reductions in 1988 the report adds The IMF urges a strong interest rate policy to signal the governments determination to keep its currency strong and to curb inflation It says firmer long-term rates would slow private net long-term capital outflows which increased strongly in 1986 It also urges net repayments of foreign currency debt and an overhaul of domestic capital markets to facilitate the subscriptions by non-residents of government bond issues in Belgian francs

3246	This year will see a pickup in US economic growth and inflation the Shadow Open Market Committee said in its semi-annual policy statement The SOMC a group of basically monetarist private economists said that economic growth will accelerate in 1987 in response to powerful stimulative actions by the Federal Reserve The group said the Feds actions have been excessive As a result it said that inflation and ultimately another recession now loom on the horizon The SOMC said that central bank policies that rely on progressively larger swings in monetary expansion will not lead to sustainable economic growth and stable prices The group made no specific nominal forecasts of economic or inflation growth in its policy statement However the Committee at its Sunday policy-making meeting said it was basically in accord with projections by Jerry Jordan who is a member of the SOMC and economist at First Interestate Bancorp Jordan expects real GNP growth to be about one percentage point higher than in the past two years He expects consumer prices to rise about 4-12 pct this year The SOMC said in recent months rapid money growth has been a principal cause of the devaluation To avoid another costly inflation and disinflation the SOMC urged the Fed to abandon its inflationary policy and set the growth rate of the monetary base on the path toward sustained lower inflation The Fed in February said it would no longer target the narrow M-1 money supply because the link between M-1 and economic growth has been largely severed 
3351	a confidential world bank report on the peruvian economy said the governments strategy does not offer good prospects for medium and long-term growth and is likely to quickly lead to inflation The report published today by an economic monthly the peru report said the success of president alan garcias government in stimulating output last year to achieve eight pct gross domestic product growth represents gains in the short term at the expense of the long Government officials had no immediate comment on the report which advised a reduction in the overall size of the public investment programme and greater emphasis on the preservation of perus export potential The report said that although the government had succeeded in cutting inflation 50 pct a year in the first half of 1985 to under 70 pct its stabilisation and reactivation programme was encountering increasing difficulties an early renewal of inflationary pressures linked to monetary expansion exchange rate devaluation and an easing of price controls appears not improbable it added

4165	The worst may be just about over for Japans battered economy but economists said they do not expect a vigorous recovery anytime soon Japanese bank economists polled by Reuters said the economys 18 month-old slowdown is likely to end in the first half of this year helped by rising exports stepped-up government spending and falling prices The economy will bottom out in the middle of the year said Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist Masahiko Koido Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd senior economist Susumu Taketomi agreed It the bottom is in the offing he said But he added that the recovery will be slow Growth in the fiscal year beginning next month will only pick-up 22 pct from two pct in the current year he said Signs that the economy has just about weathered the worst are increasing The volume of exports in the first two months of the year rose slightly on a year-on-year basis after declining toward the end of last year Although this may be due to extraordinary factors such as a sharp rise in car exports to rebuild depleted European stocks several economists said it could mark the beginning of a recovery Industrial production fell 07 pct in January much smaller than expected and is forecast by the government to rise 03 pct in February and 26 pct in March A Bank of Japan survey released last week showed that the decline in Japanese corporate earnings may be nearing its end And the Paris currency accord last month has fostered hopes the rapid yen rise has come to the end they said Six nations - the UK Canada France Japan the US And West Germany - pledged in Paris last month to stabilise currencies around current levels The yens 40 pct climb against the dollar over the last two years has hit the export-driven economy hard by forcing its companies to raise prices and lose sales in the US Market The important thing is the exchange rate Taketomi said If it stabilises firms will grow more confident and raise investment in plant and equipment although there are no signs of that yet economists said A stable yen would also help exporters regain some of their competitive edge just as the US economy may be starting to recover economists said Domestically the economy may get a boost from some loosening of the governments tight fiscal policy said Haruo Muto manager of national economics at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd The next reading of the economys health should come early next week with the release of gnp figures for the last quarter 1986 Most private economists expect a rise of about 05 pct from the previous quarter In the third quarter GNP rose 06 pct But a senior government official said the fourth quarter figures could surprise by showing a rise of more than one point quarter-on-quarter But he added that would be a statistical aberration and not a significant shift in economic activity To maintain year-on-year growth of around 25 pct the economy would have had to rise about 12 pct in the fourth quarter as the final quarter of 1985 was strong The rise in the fourth quarter of 1985 was probably a statistical anomaly that was repeated in the final months of 1986 the official said Economists said the fourth quarter figures were also distorted by the governments sale of gold coins in the second half of 1986 Because the coins were classified as legal tender their purchase did not show up in the statistics on consumer expenditure Consumer spending also tailed off in December because of bad weather and smaller-than-normal end-year bonuses they said As the government had to buy back some of the coins from retailers because they were unsold the governments contribution to the economy in the fourth quarter may have been boosted economists said Taketomi said it may have received a further boost from government buying of farm products as the domestic crop last year was good The senior government official said the fourth quarter performance of the domestic sector was probably worse than generally expected while that of the external sector was better

4548	Bolivia is to make a formal offer during the next few months to buy back its 900 mln dlrs debt from commercial banks at a discount of up to 90 pct central bank president Jier Nogales said Nogales told Reuters in an interview the steering committee of Bolivias creditor banks had agreed to consider the offer at a meeting in New York last month He said the offer would be based on the value of Bolivian paper on the international secondary debt market where it now trades at between 10 and 15 pct of its face value Nogales said Bolivia will make a single offer to buy back its commercial debt and banks who accepted would be paid the discounted rate in full Banks which declined the offer would be repaid over 20 to 30 years at interest rates below those fixed in the international markets he added Bolivia has frozen payments on medium and long term loans to commercial banks since March 1984 and Nogales said there would be no money available to restart traditional debt servicing to them for some time Several Latin American countries have initiated schemes to cancel foreign debt by equity swaps or third party buy-backs but Bolivia would be the first country in the region to make a formal offer to buy back all its commercial bank debt at discounted rates Nogales said practical and strategic considerations would determine the exact timing of the offer but it would be made in the next few months He said Bolivia would not bargain with creditor banks over the price to paid for the debt paper they hold and would make a single non-negotiable offer He said Bolivia could not even pay interest to friendly creditor countries let alone commercial banks The only traditional way forward was to capitalise interest which would mean greater bank exposure in Bolivia and greater loss provisions he added We are confident that the banks are going to be reasonable Nogales said Now they can resolve their problems for once and for all The most conservative ones who want a little more will wait a year but I dont know if the window of opportunity will be open all the time he added Discussing the status of other parts of Bolivias four billion dlr foreign debt 25 billion of which is owed to governments and the rest to international agencies Nogales said negotiators had achieved considerable success in recent discussions with the Paris Club He said Paris Club creditors had agreed to reschedule Bolivian debt over 10 years with five to six years grace while accepting that interest would not be paid until 1989 Interest rates were being discussed on a bilateral basis under Paris Club rules he added He said some Paris Club members had agreed to disregard penalty interest payments and negotiations were continuing with Argentina and Brazil who hold 700 mln dlrs of Bolivian debt He said Bolivia was continuing to service loans from international agencies and it expected to receive up to 400 mln dlrs in disbursements this year The capital flow for loans and their servicing had changed from a negative balance of 250 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow of 130 mln dlrs last year he added Nogales said that Bolivias net international reserves now stood at around 250 mln dlrs compared to one mln dlrs in disposable funds when the government of Victor Paz Estenssoro took office in August 1985 Nogales said inflation which soared to over 20000 pct a year in the governments first month in office was now down to 10 pct on an annualised basis from the last six months and the plan was that it should continue at this level He said the government was also expecting at least three pct growth in gdp this year after several years of negative rates
4573	president jaime lusinchi defended the 203 billion dlr debt rescheduling accord his government recently signed saying it will open new credit flows and bring needed foreign investment to venezuela In his annual state of the nation speech lusinchi also said venezuela supports other latin american debtors despite having reached a rescheduling accord on its own In the 90-minute speech to the congress lusinchi summed up the achievements of his administration which took office in february 1984 He pointed to the 33 pct growth in non-oil gdp in 1986 and to a moderate 12 pct inflation rate Lusinchi said the 203 billion dlr debt rescheduling signed feb 27 put an end to a process which had been the calvary of our nation over the post four years In the refinancing accord he said venezuela managed to achieve the most inmportant thing which is the reopening of financial flows from abroad essential for the financing of development and the financing of trade and investment Once all the details of the agreement are finalized he said venezuela will seek new financing for the imported components of new development projects our intention is not to continue being net exporters of capital but to protect our balance of payments with a flow of capital towards venezuela he said Under the agreement signed february 27 venezuela extended payments on the debt from 12 to 14 years while the interest rate was lowered from 1 y 18 to 78 of a pct over libor At the same time payments over the next three years were lowered from 3450 to 1350 billion dlrs Lusinchi defended the rescheduling accord against critics who said it merely deferred the weight of payments to future governments
4625	Senior US Economic officials disagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget deficit reduction targets Beryl Sprinkel chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers reiterated the Reagan Administrations opposition to a tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting spending and fostering economic growth By contrast Rudolph Penner Director of the Congressional Budget Office said the budget process has broken down and the deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987 Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility for local projects to state governments He also suggested a line-item veto which allows the President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it to limit wasteful spending Spending and taxing decisions should be linked more closely Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 27 pct growth in US Real gross national product GNP in 1987 and 35 pct in 1988 Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of economic growth is attainable Sprinkel said It looks pretty good to me Weve had two very strong employment reports He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate adding It looks like theyre on track While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax reform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will greatly increase private production incentives he said Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest national net output of goods and services will permanently increase by approximately two pct because of the long-run consequences of tax reform Sprinkel said In 1986 this would have amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the income of the average American family Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible for the large increase in the budget deficit In fiscal 1986 ending September federal spending amounted to 238 pct of GNP while federal receipts absorbed 185 pct of GNP leaving a deficit of 53 pct he said Sprinkel said that compared with fiscal 1978 the 1986 federal expenditure share of GNP is 27 percentage points higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same Contrary to the conventional wisdom therefore the 1981 tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget deficits of the past few years Sprinkel said This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced tax increases that occurred between 1978 and 1981 he added However the Congressional Budget Offices Rudolph Penner argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the Administration or Congress indeed with increases in defence spending now all the options for reducing the budget deficit are unpleasant he said Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological turmoil in the US Caused by the biggest sustained inflation in our nations history which helped foster widespread distrust of government The American people turned on the government with tax revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at the national level Penner said But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike of spending programs Now the correction of that 1981 mistake demands that the system change a lot Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will remain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is not likely to succeed I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to dictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply because theres no  Way to enforce it Penner said Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget deficit was cut He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated by one-time measures such as a temporary increase in taxes related to tax reform and sales of government assets Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative timing changes like moving the military payday from the last day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988 That saved more than two billion dlrs Penner said
4944	US February reports reflecting slim gains in industrial output and moderating inflation pressures reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to follow a stable course of monetary policy economists said If youre the Fed theres no reason to do anything said Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc There are hints that GNP is picking up On the inflation front all is well he said Money supply is well under control Its an absolutely ideal situation February US industrial production rose 05 pct slightly less than the 07 pct gain the financial markets had expected This compared with a slim 01 pct rise in Januarys production number previously reported as a 04 pct increase The February US producer price index gained only 01 pct less than a 03-04 pct expected rise This followed a 06 pct rise in the PPI in January The Fed is going to look at this positively said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation Certainly inflation is not as bad as what Volcker Fed Chairman has said lately Industrial production growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants The energy products component of PPI rose 40 pct in February after a 98 pct increase in January This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflation is behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs per barrel said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc The trend is still 35 pct in the first half of the year In 1986 declining energy prices contributed to a 25 pct decline in the PPI Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected but a sharp drop in auto prices was not Passenger car prices fell 34 pct and light truck prices dropped 13 pct Yesterday Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said that a possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in both the financial markets and the Federal Reserve The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectations today said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easier monetary policy Brusca said if import prices do not rise this could necessitate a weaker dollar The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air he said We need inflation for US producers to compete with foreign producers Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 08 pct in Februarys PPI With many electronic goods produced overseas this may show that foreign producers are not raising prices which bodes ill for US competitiveness he said If further dollar declines are needed this could diminish overseas investment in US debt Brusca added which might necessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices By contrast Slifer said imported goods prices rose 118 pct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting to a large degree a 22 pct drop in the trade-weighted real value of the dollar from February 1985 to February 1987 Slifer said import prices may rise further as manufacturers contracts put in place before the dollar dropped to current levels expire and new contracts are made that reflect a weaker dollar David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that imported manufactured goods prices rose 85 pct at an annual rate in the second half of 1986 which has contributed to rising US industrial output Its the other side of the lower dollar Wyss said Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitive and they are increasing output Wyss said that the latest data point to an average industrial production gain of 03-04 pct in the first quarter Its an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector is beginning to revive But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not convinced that the February reports portend economic gains He said much of the strength came from factors that do not point to a sustained rise in industrial output Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farm equipment industries helped account for a one pct rise in February business equipment production Utilities output rose 07 pct in February after gaining 12 pct in January but Roach said it shows mostly that more energy was produced not that manufacturing activity gained Finally he pointed out that auto production accounted for half of the industrial production gain as production of auto assemblies rose to 83 million units at an annual rate from 75 million units In the first quarter it looks like automakers are producing at an 85 mln unit annual rate but selling at roughly a seven mln unit rate Roach said The disparity between output and sales is showing up in inventories Economists pointed to sharp rise in January US business inventories as a sign that production may be outstripping demand in the first quarter of 1987 January business inventories rose 09 pct the largest gain since July 1979 when inventories rose 17 pct the Commerce Department said Business sales dropped 45 pct in January the largest monthly sales drop on record Nonetheless economists do not expect the Fed to react to month-to-month changes The Fed has been standing pat for the last seven months Ramirez said They will continue to stand pat for at least the next couple of months

5447	The Belgian government has lowered its forecast for the nominal increase in gross national product in 1987 to 35 pct from an originally forecast 39 pct Prime Minister Wilfried Martens said in a statement to parliament He said this revision which brings government forecasts more closely into line with those by private institutions takes account of an anticipated slowdown in the world economy and international trade But he said the impact on the Belgian economy will be limited due to recent agreements on wages and working conditions agreed by employers and unions Martens did not say how much the government expected GNP to grow in volume terms However last month the governments Planning Bureau said it had revised its 1987 forecast for this to 09 pct from 20 pct In 1986 Belgiums gross national product rose 215 pct in volume terms against a 59 pct nominal rise
5453	External risks for the economy have increased but growth of two to 25 pct this year is still possible according to President of the West German Federation of Banks Hanns Christian Schroeder-Hohenwarth Schroeder-Hohenwarth told a news conference the further fall of the dollar since the start of this year and the revaluation of the mark against European currencies meant West German exporters were facing a rough wind However domestic demand was continuing to rise and private consumption in particular would support the economy he said He saw good prospects for consumer industries Schroeder-Hohenwarth said economic policy now had to concentrate on strengthening this domestic growth In this context he welcomed a decision by the government to increase the scope of tax cuts due in 1988 He added a planned reform of the fiscal system scheduled for 1990 which was worked out by coalition partners this month was an important step in the right direction The government plans to cut corporation tax to 50 pct from 56 pct However Schroeder-Hohenwarth said the decision to cut the maximum rate of income tax to only 53 pct from 56 pct was rather half-hearted
5458	Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said his countrys foreign debt crisis could only be solved by changes in the international financial system Speaking to a business conference he said It is not Brazil that has to make adjustments with the IMF International Monetary Fund It is the international financial community that is taking away resources from the developing countries The crisis is not in Brazil a country that has had the third biggest trade surplus In the past two years Brazil had remitted 24 billion dlrs in debt servicing and received only two billion in fresh funds he added Funaro said that during his recent trip to the US Europe and Japan to explain Brazils decision last month to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt he stressed the countrys commitment to growth We need to and will make the effort to solve the debt problem but we cannot make an effort that means we stop growing he said adding that political and not purely commercial solutions were needed to the debt crisis Brazil whose 108 billion dlr foreign debt is the largest in the developing world has been under pressure from official and private creditors to work out an economic adjustment program with the IMF to combat rocketing inflation and foreign payments problems President Jose Sarneys government has repeatedly refused to approach the Fund arguing that an IMF programme would lead to recession Funaro said that in his talks with creditors he had tried to restore credibility in the country in the hope of finding a lasting solution to the debt problem We are negotiating so that the debt question should not be one of continuous crisis To sustain internal growth Brazil would have to import more machinery and equipment this year and export fewer raw materials The country was thus targetting a fall in this years trade surplus to 80 billion dlrs from 1986s 95 billion Domestically Funaro said economies had led to a reduction in the public sector deficit to 27 pct of gross domestic product in 1986 the lowest for many years and that this should fall to 15 pct this year
5472	Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens announced to Parliament a plan to reduce the 1987 government financing requirement by 206 billion francs He said this will enable the requirement to be held to 4197 billion francs against the previous government target of 4178 billion or eight pct of gross national product Martens said following a lowering of government estimates of 1987 nominal GNP growth and a re-estimation by government departments of 1987 spending the government calculated that unless action was taken the requirement would exceed the target by 225 billion francs Martens said the plan involved raising non-fiscal receipts by 58 billion francs and reducing spending by 143 billion The remaining 05 billion francs will be raised through treasury operations Martens said the money is being found through a series of small economies and confirmed that it includes the raising of two billion francs through the sale of part of the governments 50 pct holding in the gas company Distrigaz Last year the government announced a major program designed to cut 1987 spending by 195 billion francs The program was designed to get Belgium out of what the government said was a snowball effect under which the government constantly borrowed more to finance budget deficits which were due largely to the cost of servicing and repaying existing debt In 1986 the government financing requirement is estimated at 561 billion francs or 110 pct of GNP

5849	Zimbabwes real gross domestic product increased 02 pct in 1986 according to preliminary figures published by the Central Statistical Office CSO This contrasts with a rise of more than nine pct in 1985 The main reason for the slower rate of economic growth was a drop in the real value of agricultural output This declined 12 pct in 1986 following a 24 pct improvement the previous year Mining output fell one pct in 1986 but manufacturing production increased 14 pct The CSO said that at current prices GDP rose 127 pct to 82 billion Zimbabwe dlrs but inflation measured by the GDP deflator was estimated at 122 pct so there was virtually no growth in real output during 1986
5879	The Japanese economy will remain sluggish in the months ahead after turning in its worst performance for 12 years in 1986 private economists said Consumer spending a main driving force of domestic demand was likely to remain lacklustre although brisk housing and business investment would help sustain the economy this year the economists said They said they were shocked by an Economic Planning Agency report today that private spending fell 07 pct in the OctDec quarter for the first time in 12 years The report said Japans gross national product rose a real 08 pct in OctDec after a revised 07 pct increase in the previous quarter It said GNP growth for 1986 was a real 25 pct down from 47 pct in 1985 Agency officials said this was the worst performance since 1974 when GNP contracted 14 pct in the wake of the first oil crisis They expressed concern about the 07 pct decline in consumer spending in the final quarter of 1986 but said it was only temporary as exceptionally warm winter weather had depressed retail sales But most private economists disagreed and said consumers were likely to remain pessimistic in coming months as they saw their real income level off Sure consumers may have spent less on winter clothes or heating apparatus because of the warm winter this year but they have done so because they have become even more uneasy about their future pay rises said Shoji Saito general manager of Mitsui Banks economic research division He said the outlook for pay increases was gloomy because of falling employment in many industries particularly those hit hard by the yens rise Masao Suzaki senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo said weakened consumer confidence was the most worrying factor Without brisk consumer spending Japan can hardly achieve domestically generated economic growth as the government has put a lid on fiscal measures he said Other economists said the 08 pct growth registered in OctDec may have been inflated by special factors including exceptionally heavy spending in the public sector Johsen Takahashi chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute said the 144 pct increase in public sector spending in OctDec resulted from an issue of gold coins This is just a one-shot spending and we cant expect that high level of public-sector consumption in the following quarter Takahashi said Agency officials said public spending would have risen 11 pct in OctDec without the issue which marked 60 years of Emperor Hirohitos reign Takahashi said the economy might contract in the current quarter given the lack of additional significant government spending and sluggish consumer spending Saito said the most effective government action would be income tax cuts and the postponement beyond next January of a proposed controversial sales tax
5985	Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson presenting his budget for fiscal 198788 to Parliament said UK Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar 1987 He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of payments deficit in 1987 of 25 billion stg after a 11 billion shortfall in 1986 Inflation is expected to be 40 pct at the end of this year Lawson said As I forecast in the Autumn Statement inflation may continue to edge up for a time perhaps exceeding 45 pct by the summer before falling back to 40 pct by the end of the year he added Turning to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement PSBR Lawson said the likely outturn for fiscal 198687 was 40 billion stg or 10 pct of GDP The planned PSBR for 198788 was set at 40 billion stg On monetary policy Lawson confirmed the target range for the narrow M0 measure would be two to six pct in fiscal 198788 No explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3 aggregate he said But broad money will continue to be taken into account in assessing monetary conditions as of course will the exchange rate the Chancellor told Parliament Lawson said the low outturn of the PSBR in 198687 is chiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general and the corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business sector in particular On oil prices Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per barrel in calendar 1987 He said it is clear that the increased flow of non-oil tax revenues coupled with the prospective further growth of the economy in excess of the growth of public expenditure puts the public finances in a very strong position Lawson said the Treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at 10 pct of GDP in future We have reached what I judge to be the Medium Term Financial Strategys appropriate destination - a PSBR of 10 pct of GDP My aim will be to keep it there over the years ahead Lawson said Inevitably this greatly diminishes the scope I have this year for reducing the burden of taxation which of course remains a major objective of government policy But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudence and caution and to build a still firmer base for the future Lawson said the time had come to strike the Exchange Control Act from the Statute book On corporation tax he said the rate will remain unchanged at 35 pct in 198788 But companies capital gains will be charged at the appropriate corporation tax rate He said that under the new proposed system companies should be able to set Advanced Capital Tax ACT payments against tax on capital gains Taken together these changes should yield 60 mln stg in 198889 Lawson said Lawson said he will propose that all companies and building societies be treated the same way on payment of corporation tax with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months after the end of the accounting period on which the tax is due I also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a new method of collecting corporation tax to be known as Pay and File This would be part of a wider programme of streamlining tax collection and would not come into force until the early 1990s Lawson said he planned two reliefs on Petroleum Revenue Tax PRT As from today companies may elect to have up to 10 pct of the costs of developing certain new fields set against their PRT liabilities in existing fields until the income of those new fields exceeds the costs incurred Second there will be a new relief against PRT for spending on research into UK Oil extraction that is not related to any particular field On business employment Lawson said employers will receive tax relief for retraining workers Lawson said that in future traders registered for Value Added Tax VAT would be able to choose to account for the tax on the basis of cash paid and received Small businesses may account for VAT annually instead of quarterly The VAT compulsory registration period was being extended to 30 days he added and VAT registration thresholds are to be raised to 21300 stg New measures are planned to combat VAT avoidance he added The capital gains tax retirement relief limit would now be set at 125000 stg Lawson said he proposed to change the law so that companies in multinational groups with dual residence will no longer be able to secure tax relief twice on the same interest payment The change will take effect on April 1 1987 but genuine trading companies will not be affected He also planned to end the present treatment of tax credit relief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bank loans also from April 1 In future banks will be able to offset this tax credit only against tax on the profit on the relevant loan he said The standard rate of taxation is being reduced by two pence to 27 pct from 29 pct Lawson reiterated the governments aim of reducing basic taxation to 25 pence in the pound but added given my decision to use the greater part of the fiscal scope I now have to reduce the PSBR that goal cannot be achieved in this budget Small companies corporation tax is also being reduced to 27 pct he said On the Lloyds insurance market Lawson said he planned to change the tax treatment of Lloyds syndicates bringing it into line with that of provisions for outstanding liabilities made by ordinary insurance companies and of comparable provisions made by financial traders The Inland Revenue would be told to consult urgently with Lloyds about the details of the legislation he said The new rules will first apply to premiums payable for the Lloyds account which closes on December 31 this year Lawson said MORE

6197	Surprisingly strong US housing statistics for February cannot be taken as an indication that the economy is generating any momentum and are not sufficient cause to start lifting forecasts for first quarter growth economists said Building was boosted by two factors last month unusually mild weather and low mortgage rates But economists said that seasonal factors make it hard to assess what spur to the economy if any will come from housing in coming months And after a steady retreat mortgage rates seem to be near bottom US housing starts rose 26 pct in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1851 mln units from 1804 mln in January It was the highest pace for starts since April 1986 The rate at which permits were issued for future building climbed 44 pct to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1764 mln units after dropping 1152 pct to 1690 mln in January Februarys weather is usually more adverse for home building Because of seasonal factors its difficult to determine what this means for the economy down the road said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp The housing report is seasonally-weighted to compensate for weather-related setbacks As a result milder temperatures inflate the statistics Economists said that low mortgage rates also were a spur to building last month But several believe that rates will now consolidate before edging up in late springearly summer Builders are looking at current mortgage rates and saying Lets do it now said Mark Obrinsky of the US League of Savings Institutions in Washington whose members supply much of the financing for home building But Obrinsky doubts that there is much more downward potential for rates because he foresees higher inflation and some overall improvement in the US economy He expects rates to gain 50 to 100 basis points in early summer from the 950 pct fixed rate effective in February Last November fixed rate mortgages were about 1030 pct As expected the strength in housing was concentrated in the single-family sector The multi-family area -- which typically represents rental units -- remained weak due to high vacancy rates and increased capital costs of such units following tax law changes effective January 1 Single-family starts rose at a 56 pct annual pace to 1317 mln units Multi-family fell 41 pct to a 534000 rate Strength in the single-family sector indicates that low mortgage rates are doing their job But were probably not looking at a great deal of growth potential said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets McCarthy noted that the housing report together with larger than expected gains in US employment industrial output and retail sales in February may cause some observers to start waving four pct GNP banners for the first quarter Gross national product grew 13 pct in the fourth quarter But McCarthy who still expects first quarter real GNP to come in at an annual rate of 25 pct or slightly above is not convinced that growth will pick up in future The big story is the inventory re-building thats going on now not all of which is intentional he said For example US automakers who are already saddled with high stocks produced at an annual rate of 83 mln units in February compared with domestic car sales of 73 mln Thus while inventories could contribute to GNP in the first quarter they may result in scaled-back production and weaker growth in the second he said If most of the first quarter growth is inventory building and we cannot identify any improvement in export demand then there is the potential for softness in the second quarter agreed Allan Leslie of Discount Corp He is still evaluating first quarter GNP prospects Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker said last week that current data do not show the worsening in trade has reversed At the same time that we are pumping up inventories in the first quarter we could foresee production slowing in the second cautioned Joe Plocek of McCarthy Crisanti and Maffei Inc who expects first quarter growth of about three pct

6406	New Zealands inflation and interest rates should decline and the balance of payments improve significantly in the fiscal year to the end of March 1988 the Institute of Economic Research NZIER said The independent institute said in its quarterly March issue that it was also revising its fiscal 1987 real gross domestic product GDP forecast to a fall of 05 pct against the one pct drop forecast in December Government figures show GDP grew at an annual 18 pct in the quarter to September and 34 pct in the June quarter The NZIER said the sharp improvement in the June and September quarters was due mainly to a new tax structure and the introduction of a 10 pct value-added goods and services tax and is not expected to continue in the second half of 198687 The governments tight fiscal position is not expected to change it said Annual inflation measured by the consumer price index is forecast to fall to nine pct by next March from 182 pct in calendar 1986 it said Falling inflation is likely to give significant scope for reductions in nominal interest rates real interest rates are also expected to ease albeit slightly as the balance of payments deficit and hence the call on overseas capital falls away the NZIER said Short-term interest rates are forecast to remain between 20 and 25 pct until the June quarter but will decline over the second half of 198788 to between 16 and 18 pct Long-term rates are expected to fall to between 14 and 16 pct Five year government bond rates are currently 1840 pct and the key indicator 30-day bank bills 2653 pct The local dollar is expected to depreciate steadily in the early part of the coming year and by next March reach 575 on the Reserve Banks trade weighted index which is based on a basket of currencies The index now stands at around 664 A marked improvement in the balance of payments is forecast the NZIER said The current account deficit is expected to fall from 75 pct of GDP in 198586 to 45 pct in 198687 and 25 pct in 198788 The current account deficit is forecast to shrink to 132 billion NZ Dlrs in 198788 from 240 billion in 198687 and 333 billion in 198586 The 198788 budget deficit is forecast to be 28 billion dlrs against an expected 29 billion dlrs in 198687 and 187 billion in 198586 This compares with the governments 198687 deficit figure of 292 billion against an earlier forecast of 245 billion Conditions in the coming year are sufficiently subdued to contribute to marked improvements in both the balance of payments and the rate of inflation  the NZIER said Overall these are significant gains for the New Zealand economy and if they continue to be improved upon bode well for future prospects

6593	The DIW economic research institute said West German economic growth in 1987 is unlikely to reach the 15 pct rate it had forecast earlier this year The institute whose forecasts are more pessimistic than those of the other four leading German institutes said the economy had passed its peak in the summer of 1986 and its prospects had dimmed significantly since the autumn The DIW repeated earlier predictions that gross national product GNP in the first quarter of 1987 would contract in real seasonally adjusted terms against the weak final quarter of last year The DIW said that even if the economy recovers in the remaining three quarters it was unlikely that demand and production would rise strongly enough to bring GNP growth up to 15 pct Other institutes and economists have recently revised their forecasts for German 1987 growth to around two pct In a report DIW disputed arguments by other economists that the economy was showing mixed development with domestic demand healthy but foreign demand weak DIW said the crucial split was between weak demand for capital goods and strong demand for buildings and consumer goods not between foreign and domestic demand It noted that domestic demand for capital goods had been hit in recent months by the weakness of exports which had caused West German firms to scale back investment plans Service industries unlike manufacturing industry were continuing to do well because they relied on consumer demand it said In a separate report the HWWA economic research institute in Hamburg said West Germanys real trade surplus would fall markedly this year However the nominal trade surplus would show little change from 1986s record 1122 billion marks because of a further improvement in the terms of trade on average in 1987 compared with 1986 it said

6959	The strong contribution of exports to the growth in Australias gross domestic product GDP in the fourth quarter of 1986 was a significant and welcome feature of the data private economists polled by Reuters said Real GDP rose 11 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 after rising 02 pct in the third quarter and falling 11 pct a year earlier Equally significant was the decline in both private and government spending they said Exports of goods and services rose 13 pct in the fourth quarter while imports rose only 29 pct Statistics Bureau figures show Consumer spending declined 06 pct and government spending by 02 Bob Edgar of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd said the governments aim of reducing the current account deficit by boosting exports and lowering consumption to cut imports appeared to be working However he cautioned that care must be taken to keep growth restrained because if it accelerated too fast imports would increase and worsen the balance of payments Andre Morony of Bankers Trust Australia Ltd added the result was positive because growth was export-driven But he said the GDP rise came as no surprise given the growth in exports disclosed in other statistics The economists comments were echoed by Treasurer Paul Keating in a statement issued in Canberra Keating said the figures showed encouraging trends for a reduction in the current account deficit notably the decline in domestic demand and the strong increase in exports A further 35 pct fall in the terms of trade in the quarter underscored the need to continue restraint in wages prices and public sector spending and borrowing to improve Australias competitiveness he said It is clear that through the continued application of that strategy Australia will make the necessary adjustments in its external accounts and return to a more sustainable growth pattern he added

8746	The US economy is showing some promising signs of accelerated expansion despite the sluggishness of the fourth quarter last year private economists say Some of the slowness experienced in the October-December period had been expected to spill over into the first quarter this year as the tax law changes that went into effect in January slowed business and consumer spending But some of the latest economic data show signs of surprising strength in the US economy although some economists remain cautious about the outlook The Commerce Department reported today that new orders for durable goods in February jumped by 57 billion dlrs a six pct rise to 1012 billion dlrs Even excluding volatile defense goods durable goods orders rose a healthy 38 pct the agency said The February numbers surpassed the expectations of many financial analysts whose predictions ranged from flat to increases of up to five pct The JanuaryFebruary employment statistics suggest the Gross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth for the first three months of this year said Lyle Gramley an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association The US jobless rate in February and January was 67 pct the lowest rate since March 1980 The number of new non-farm jobs rose by 337000 in February after a 319000 gain in January and a 225000 December increase the government said The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate of about three to 325 pct in the first quarter said Gramley Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuilding their inventories and is not likely to be sustained in the second quarter Gramley said He expects a slowdown in the second quarter with smaller increases in personal consumption and government spending He also sees residential construction declining mostly for multi-family housing units Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of the fourth quarter slowness will continue Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant 15 pct rate in the first quarter of 1987 accelerate during the second quarter and show a brisk 45 pct annual rate in the third quarter The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in the US trade balance which is expected because of the decline in the dollars value over the last year and half The improvement will be gradual and long lasting Levy predicted Most of it will be through import reduction but at least one-third will be due to a rise in product exports as the prices of US goods become more attractive overseas The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit which soared to record levels last year will improve this year and the US economy will grow by a respectable 32 pct for the year compared with a 25 pct rate last year As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit the US has been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate their domestic demand for goods from the US and others US officials believe that would help take some of the pressure off the United States whose five years of economic growth has been the mainstay of developing countries The US economy provided them with a giant market for their goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed to service their foreign debt The government last week said the US economy grew at a modest 11 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalance between the volume of goods imported to the United States and those shipped abroad The report showed a rising volume of exports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the fact that in current dollar terms the US trade deficit worsened during the closing three months of 1986 While fourth quarter economic growth was weak corporate profits jumped a healthy 61 pct during the period the government said It also reported that inflation as measured by the GNP price deflator remained in check growing a moderate 07 pct in the period the lowest rise in 19 years The government also reported that consumer spending a key element of the five year economic recovery jumped 17 pct in February after falling two pct in January The Federal Reserve Board also reported that the manufacturing sector which had been one of the weaker elements of the US economy was showing signs of recovery In its latest report on current economic conditions the Fed said that economic activity in the various regions of the country ranged from uneven or steady to improving Manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in most regions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said the pick up in the US manufacturing sector is largely due to the drop in the dollars value He said he does not foresee a major pick up in economic activity but does not believe the economy will slip into recession either He said higher prices on imported products and wage cuts that have helped the manufacturing sector will squeeze consumers purchasing power That pattern is starting and will continue for a number of years Chimerine said He sees economic growth hovering around a modest two pct level for the next few years
