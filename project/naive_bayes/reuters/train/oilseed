200	The sharp decline in soybean crush ratios seen in the last few weeks accelerating in recent days has pushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean processing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean meal and oil The weekly US soybean crush rate was reported by the National Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 2178 mln bushels down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over the past two months when crush margins surged to the best levels seen in over a year Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed soybean futures and premiums higher prompting a pick-up in the weekly crush number However much of that export demand seems to have been met with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge in shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next few months US processors are now finding domestic livestock feed demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder than normal winter so they steadily dropped offering prices in an attempt to find buying interest soyproduct dealers said Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent weeks setting a new contract low of 13970 dlrs per ton in the nearby March contract today Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold May looking for no deliveries on first notice day tomorrow which would cause March to gain on deferreds one CBT crush trader said But theyve been bailing out this week because the March has been acting like there will be a lot delivered if not tomorrow then later in the month he added As a result of the weakness in soymeal the March crush ratio The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 226 cents per bushel today dropping over five cents in just the last two days The May crush ended today just over 17 cents so no processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable level the trader said Hopefully they will now start to cut back production to get supplies in line with demand he added With futures down processors are finding they must bid premiums for cash soybeans further reducing crush margins A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices down sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below the average cost of production cash dealers said Most soybean processing plants are still in operation with little talk of taking temporary down-time so far But processors will start halting production in the next few weeks it they continue to face unprofitable margins they added

1405	Chicago Board of trade grain traders and analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to handle their upcoming spring plantings prompting sales of new crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans in the futures markets Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because corn is protected by the acreage reduction program That gives deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they sign-up for reduced acreage but they have no price guarantees With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing rather than gamble on soybeans even though the new crop soybeancorn ratio of 291 would make planting soybeans more attractive under normal circumstances An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln more oat acres this year than last without being penalized traders said Here too acres some farmers may have been thinking of shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats due to the more attractive deal from the government they added Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six months ago which should prompt many farmers in the South to put soybean land back into cotton One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans which are easier to grow one commercial trader said

11984	US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said the United States and Argentina have settled a case brought by the US soybean crushing industry alleging unfair subsidies to Argentinas crushing industry Speaking to an Agribusiness Education forum here late yesterday Yeutter said the case was resolved at a meeting with Argentine Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figuerras during a trade ministers meeting in New Zealand last week Under a verbal understanding between the two ministers Argentina will soon abolish export taxes on soybeans and products US and Argentine officials said The US case brought by the US National Soybean Processors Association alleged Argentina through differential export taxes implicitly subsidized domestic soybean crushers The US crushing industry in its complaint under Section 301 of trade law said higher Argentine export taxes on soybeans than on products encourage the export of products and represented an unfair trade practice Yeutter told Figuerras that all agencies of the US government supported the US complaint and unless Argentina took steps to eliminate the taxes the United States would consider taking further action in the case US and Argentine officials said An Argentine official here said no timetable was given for removal of the Argentine export taxes
12002	Speculation the United States will offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to have reached a new level of intensity in the run-up to Secretary of State George Shultz visit later this month to Moscow Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheat markets since officials from the two countries held their customary semi-annual grain talks in February Moscows decision at that time to reenter the US corn market strengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13 Shultz statement two weeks ago that he would not stand in the way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export Enhancement Program EEP coupled with the announcement of his visit to Moscow was interpreted by many grain trade representatives here as a clear signal that the Reagan administration was preparing an offer Administration officials -- in and out of the US Agriculture Department -- have been extremely tight-lipped about the prospects of a subsidy offer But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned the contention the proposal is dormant suggesting that an offer while not a done deal is a live possibility Prominent US grain trade representatives -- many of whom asked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that an offer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent Others who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible are saying they would not rule one out Rep Pat Roberts R-Kan yesterday went so far as to predict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days to two weeks Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaders who had been in contact with administration officials Richard Fritz director of international marketing at US Wheat Associates said he was confident an export enhancement offer would be made by the middle of this month Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end up being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier this year when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrs per tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat Some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheat subsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases of US corn and open the door to US sales of soybeans As ever one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat deal would appear to be price Last summer the administration took the controversial step of offering the Soviets subsidized wheat -- but were embarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds that the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left US wheat prices far above world market prices The administrations decision to set the subsidy level up front instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be a means of controlling the price while attempting to dampen criticism grain trade sources said Nonetheless the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultz from saying the Soviets were chortling because Washington was offering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available to US housewives The conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives here is that a general warming of relations between the two countries since last summer combined with continued hard times in the US grain belt would favor a subsidy offer In addition the USSR has made it clear it would consider buying US wheat if it were priced more competitively However observers have not forgotten the circumstances surrounding the administrations announcement of the wheat subsidy offer last summer Up until the time of the announcment congressional and industry leaders were led to believe the White House had decided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include not only the Soviets but also a much broader list of countries Instead the administration scaled back the offer to include only the Soviets That last-minute change of heart adds a measure of uncertainty even to the predictions of those most convinced that the administration will not now pass up the opportunity to sell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union

12160	Fresh heavy rains caused further damage to the Argentine 198687 coarse grains crop in the week to yesterday particularly in Buenos Aires province trade sources said They said the sunflower maize soybean and sorghum crops were damaged and yield estimates affected New production forecasts were made for all these crops The rains over the weekend and up to yesterday registered more than 200 mm on average in western Buenos Aires and worsened the flooding in various parts of the province The weather bureau said the rains which in Buenos Aires have surpassed 750 mm in the last 30 days could continue The northeast of the country was also hit by heavy rains In Corrientes province the rains also passed an average of 200 mm in some parts notably the Paso de los Libres area bordering on Uruguay In Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces they were over 100 mm in places in Misiones and San Luis 90 mm and in Cordoba 80 mm The rains were less intense in Chaco and Formosa Harvesting in areas not actually under water could also be further delayed due to dampness in the earth the sources said The excessive humidity might also produce rotting of the crops further dimishing the yield the sources added Sunflower harvesting before the weekend rains reached 26 to 30 pct of the area sown in Santa Fe Cordoba La Pampa and Buenos Aires provinces The production forecast for 198687 sunflowerseed has been lowered to between 22 and 24 mln tonnes against 23 to 26 mln tonnes the previous week making it 415 to 463 pct lower than the record 41 mln tonnes produced last season The area sown was two to 22 mln hectares down 299 to 363 pct on the record 314 mln hectares in 198586 The maize harvest advanced to within 26 to 28 pct of the area sown in Cordoba Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires It will begin in La Pampa within about 10 days weather permitting Maize yield this season is now estimated at 96 to 99 mln tonnes against last weeks 99 to 101 mln tonnes down 214 to 226 pct on the 124 to 126 mln tonnes at which private producers put 198586 production The new forecast is 227 to 25 pct down on the official figure of 128 mln tonnes for last seasons production The grain sorghum harvest reached 17 to 19 pct of growers targets against 14 to 16 pct the previous week The production forecast was reduced to between three and 33 mln tonnes against 32 to 35 mln tonnes last week 214 to 268 pct down on last seasons 41 to 42 mln tonnes The area sown with sorghum in 198687 was 123 to 130 mln hectares down 103 to 152 pct on the 145 mln in 198586 The forecast for soybean yield this season was the least changed in relation to last week It was put at a record 75 to 77 mln tonnes against the previous 75 to 78 mln tonnes These figures are 42 to 55 pct higher than last seasons record of 72 to 73 mln tonnes according to private sources and 56 to 85 pct up on the official 71 mln tonnes The adjustment to the production forecast is due to the rains and overcast conditions which have greatly reduced the sunlight needed for this crop sources said Producers fear estimates may yet have to be adjusted down further The humidity could induce rotting and growers are still finding more empty pods due to excessively dry weather earlier in the season Soybean harvesting is due to start in mid-April in southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires

2521	Brazils recent announcement of a suspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign debt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views among many international economists and commodities analysts that Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987 The developing worlds most indebted nation is also its most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and soybeans and might maximize foreign exchange revenue by selling hard on world markets economists said That sounds like a reasonable strategy But there is no way they can trade their way out of this situation Aldo Roldan Vice President for International Services at Chase Econometrics said Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted world markets but also had to work to make its position on foreign exchange markets more profitable Domestic costs have increased due to inflation and exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange rates Roldan said The Chase economist also said commodities markets were depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a country like Brazil where pure commodities account for some 50 pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23 billion dlrs But he added They are always pretty aggressive and they have good foreign marketing channels Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be coffee and even without background pressure from foreign creditors the worlds largest producer was expected to hit the market this year with a vengeance Negotiations between International Coffee Organization ICO members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing each other of intransigence Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations which others wanted changed one senior coffee dealer said The dealer who declined to be named said Brazil wanted to preserve its market share At the end of the talks he said Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others would suffer Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales the dealer said If they do come into the market at this level it will go lower and you could breach a dollar ninety or eighty cents he said New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 229 cents lower Thursday at 10468 cents a lb while more distant deliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute Jorio Dauster told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of the ICO talks on export quotas Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the focus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts They will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been according to Richard Loewy analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc Loewy believes the foreign debt problem a good crop plus difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the Brazil soybean crop Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and they cant afford to store the crops he said The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time about large South American crops developing under near ideal conditions towards record yields We are going to see a very rapid decline earlier than usual this year in our US exports Loewy said Tommy Eshleman economist for the American Soybean Association ASA said this years Brazilian soybean harvest could total 18 mln tonnes versus 137 mln last year Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the vulnerability of the US crop to bad growing weather Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a reduction in the US government soybean loan rate offered to farmers who give crops as collateral Eshleman said He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the soybean loan rate which acts as an effective floor for prices by keeping supplies away from the free market Farmers can forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the loan Were getting into a period when they Brazil are starting to harvest and starting to export Eshleman said But he added it will be a while before US exports fall to below 10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel Burnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much as it can this year because of its economic situation He said the debt situation was a major consideration The Brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for storage he added Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops Melicias said it would not make a big difference On other commodity markets Brazils selling impact may be muted no matter its need to generate capital Brazil is faced with a poor 198687 sugar harvest which could limit exports to the world market analysts said The country may have oversold and be unable to honor export commitments and this plus higher domestic demand caused by consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar will give it little room to stretch exports they said Brazils other major crop cocoa is in its third year of surplus Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it fell so I dont think they can start throwing out cocoa and find many more markets for it one analyst said If they come out as aggressive sellers the market would collapse and they cant afford to do that she added

3540	Lower production of coconut and palm oils could lead to a decline in vegetable oil stocks this year despite growing supplies of oilseeds senior oilseeds analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Mario Balletto said Balletto told a conference of Canadian farmers at Alberta Agricultures annual farm outlook conference that the world vegetable oil situation is one of potentially tight supplies Prices for edible oils appear to have more upside potential reflecting strong world demand and an unprecedented decline in the production of tree oils Balletto said Balletto estimated production of palm coconut and palm kernel oils this year at 85 mln tonnes down from 91 mln tonnes last year enough to offset higher oilseed output He estimated total vegetable oil production this year at 334 mln tonnes up from 330 mln last year and disappearance at 340 mln tonnes up from 326 mln Unless oilseed crushing increases sharply he said disappearance of vegetable oils could exceed production by 600000 tonnes the largest deficit since 1976 If world protein meal demand stagnates thus limiting the crush of soybeans  the need for serious supply rationing in the edible oils sector could develop he said This would be relatively favorable for the prices of high oil yielding seeds Balletto said Oilseeds on the other hand remain at depressed prices because of burdensome supplies he said World ending stocks of oilseeds are estimated to increase for the fourth straight year to a record 284 mln tonnes compared with 254 mln last year The increase should result from lower disappearance as production is expected to fall to 1840 mln tonnes from 1857 mln last year he said World soybean production in 1987 totalled a record 989 mln tonnes up from 906 mln the previous year Balletto said while production of other oilseeds was lower Higher soybean production in South America and Europe made up for lower production in the United States he said Soybeans account for the bulk of the surplus and US stocks make up most of those Balletto said The Commodity Credit Corporation owned 127 mln tonnes about half of the world soybean surplus he said Since 1983-84 he said world oilseed stocks have increased 131 mln tonnes During the same period US soybean stocks increased 121 mln tonnes becoming the dumping ground of the entire world surplus courtesy of the CCC and highlighting the artificially high prices caused by the US loan program Soybean prices and to a great extent world oilseeds prices are likely to be dominated by the loan program as long as the US soybean surplus continues For the 1987 crop he said prices are likely to hover in a range tied to the US loan program Upside potential for prices is limited by the huge supply overhang while strong underlying support is provided by the US loan rate The problem is likely to become worse as the artificially high prices encourage producers in South America Canada and Australia to shift from grains to oilseeds Balletto said
3888	France supports the European Commissions plans for a European Community EC fats and oils tax but objects to some of its oilseeds proposals Yves Van Haecke an aide to French agriculture minister Francois Guillaume said He told a general assembly of Frances Oilseeds Federation FFCOP that a suppression of monthly increases of oilseed support prices for example was unacceptable French oilseeds experts added the principle of a single tax regardless of varying quality was clumsy and capable of unneccessarily alienating exporters such as the US

4392	US Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said a marketing loan for soybeans would serve no present purpose because the US price is not above the world price Asked in an interview if it was time to consider a marketing loan for soybeans Lyng said I dont think so I dont think the world price is lower than our price anyway However the USDA secretary said that if current conditions of surplus production persisted it might be appropriate to consider a marketing loan I suppose that under that condition there is a danger our exports will continue to drop and that the government will continue to accumulate large stocks of soybeans he said It might be worth contemplating a marketing loan if there were a world market that was lower than our market
4490	Implementation of a one-year 092 pilot program for wheat and feedgrains was strongly promoted today by the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee as a way to cut farm costs and simultaneously give farmers another option when making their planting decisions We have a budget driven farm policy It may be a shame but we are locked into this said Dan Glickman D-Kans chairman of the subcommittee on wheat soybeans and feed grains We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt the farmer A 092 plan if properly done could do both Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 092 bill for 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains An aide to Glickman said that it will probably be introduced next week Glickman said a 092 program which allows a farmer to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency payment would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill --only an extension of the 5092 option already provided under the current bill It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill he said but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet budget goals a voluntary 092 plan would be better than sharply cutting target prices as USDA has proposed A 092 plan however would not be decoupling but simply a different type of acreage diversion program Glickman said Decoupling -- delinking planting decisions from government payments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at this point he said I dont think there is any interest in pursuing a decoupling bill this year Period Unequivocal Glickman said at the hearing Sen Rudy Boschwitz R-Minn cosponsor of the BorenBoschwitz decoupling plan said he supports a short term 092 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan Boschwitz plans to introduce a 092 plan in the senate His plan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment to participating farmers require that idled acreage be put to conservation use only prohibit haying and grazing on extra idled acreage limit participation to a certain number of acres in a county and provide tenant protection provisions I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987 but we can at least move in that direction Boschwitz said Robbin Johnson vice president of Cargill Inc testified in favor of decoupling Decoupling would end the current bias in US farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers dependency on the government he said A 092 plan does not go far enough in decoupling Johnson said and would still encourage farmers to plant Officials from the National Corn Growers Association and the National Cattlemens Association said their groups oppose any 092 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening the farm bill and creating more confusion among farmers But when asked if his association were forced to choose between a ten pct cut in target prices or a 092 program Larry Johnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 092 rather than take sharp cuts in target levels

4549	A marketing loan for US wheat feedgrains and soybeans would do nothing to help the surplus production situation and would be extremely costly Sen Rudy Boschwitz R-Minn said I think I would not support a marketing loan now he told the House agriculture subcommittee on wheat soybeans and feedgrains Boschwitz was one of the original supporters of a marketing loan for cotton and rice but has since focused support on decoupling legislation the BorenBoschwitiz bill A market loan for grains and soybeans would encourage more production especially in high-yielding areas would be much more expensive than the current cotton and rice marketing loans and not increase exports significantly he said

5702	A high-level meeting last week which included the Secretary of Agriculture and other senior  USDA officials along with leaders of the major soybean lobbying groups failed to reach any decision on what should be done about the soybean loan level participants at the meeting told Reuters We didnt feel a lot was accomplished last week but we were delighted to meet with the Secretary and he didnt close the door on anything a member of the soybean delegation said At issue is the current soybean loan and the fact that at the present level of 477 dlrs without Gramm-Rudman reductions it encourages foreign soybean production by making soybeans more profitable to grow than corn But while recognizing that soybeans are priced too high in relation with corn soybean groups have pledged their support to maintaining current price supports for soybean growers Leaders of the American Soybean Association and the National Soybean Processors Association offered specific loan options to USDA Secretary Lyng in last weeks meeting but participants would not reveal what those options were There were no surprises in our package one participant said Bandied about for several weeks has been the idea of offering producers soybean loans partially in cash and in certificates The most prevailing scheme would be to pay a 477 loan with 77 cts worth of soybean-specific certificates which would not have to be paid back and the remaining four dlrs in cash This would have the effect of lowering the world price maintaining domestic support levels and reducing the governments soybean inventory A marketing loan for soybeans was not discussed at last weeks meeting participants said One member of the soybean delegation said that the meeting was a listening session for USDA and that the proposals will now be studied further by the Department USDA officials however would not commit to any time frame Participants in the meeting do not look for changes in the soybean loan to be announced in the near future USDA is very sensitive about saying anything that could influence the market so the Secretary was very non-committal a participant said
5761	The European Communitys EC executive Commission defended attacks on major elements of its ambitious program to rid the EC of its controversial farm surpluses after strong attacks from northern states Britain and West Germany backed by the Netherlands and Denmark opposed a proposed tax on edible oils and fats which has already sparked strong protest from exporters to the EC led by the US and from EC consumer groups diplomats said But EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen told journalists he had warned ministers that failure to agree the tax proposed last month as part of the Commissions annual farm price package would leave a large hole in the groups budget He added that he hoped states had not yet made their mind up for good I hope the debate is still open if not there will be a formidable hole in the budget he said The shortfall could reach two billion dollars in 1988 and would be only slightly less this year he said Foreign ministers were taking a first look at the tax ahead of farm ministers in a move described by diplomats as unprecedented and welcomed by Andriessen as a sign ministers recognised the importance of reforming the ECs farm policy The proposed tax is designed to provide the EC with extra cash to finance community oilseed crops at their current levels and to brake a dramatic decrease in olive oil consumption by making it more competitive with other oils Andriessen noted the EC has over two mln olive oil producers mostly small farmers who could be helped by the tax What we are suggesting is reasonable it should be better understood not just outside the community but at home he said Britain normally a keen advocate of radical changes in the ECs costly farm subsidies system warned the proposal to impose the tax on both domestic and imported oils and fats could seriously damage the ECs trade relations with other countries Britain also warned that the tax could hit developing countries already receiving aid from the EC they said The Commission also defended proposals to dismantle Monetary Compensatory Amounts MCA -- a system of cross border subsidies and taxes to level out foreign exchange fluctuations for farm exports -- against harsh West German criticism In a letter this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to EC executive Commission President Jacques Delors Kohl made clear such a dismantling would mainly hit West German farmers Diplomats said West Germany again repeated its criticism at the talks here but Andriessen told journalists that Germany had been alone in its opposition The question was a key aspect of the Commissions farm price proposals he added Ministers also agreed a 35 billion dlrs scheme to rid the EC of its butter mountain despite Spanish and Portuguese opposition The scheme will pay for the disposal of one mln tonnes of unwanted butter by selling it at knock-down prices turning it into animal feed or exporting it at subsidised prices National capitals are due to be reimbursed later out of savings from another plan to curb milk production Diplomats said Spain and Portugal have been angered by the scheme which they feel forces them to pay for massive surpluses built up before they joined the community last year but the two countries did not block todays vote

6265	Upcoming changes being considered in the US Agriculture Departments transportation and loan programs were outlined by a USDA official today Addressing the annual meeting of the National Grain and Feed Association Tom VonGarlem assistant deputy administrator for USDAs state and county operations said the following changes are under consideration by USDA Termination of USDAs Transportation Assistance Program for wheat barley and sorghum would be proposed this week Changes in USDAs reserve rotation program are also under consideration VonGarlem said While the department has not made any final decision banning the use of pik and roll grain in reserve rotation is under heavy consideration he said Changes in loan rates will definitely be looked at for next years crop he said with the option of making soybean loans partially in cash and in certificates under consideration VanGarlem said he will definitely not extend the 1987 crop program signup saying he sees no reason to do so at this time He also said wheat will not be considered for a cash bonus under the Conservation Reserve Program
6269	Seven major US farm groups took the unusual step of releasing a joint statement urging congressional leaders not to tinker with existing farm law Following meetings with House Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza D-Tex and Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy D-Vt the groups issued a statement saying lawmakers should resist efforts to overhaul the 15-month-old law which is operating in its first crop marketing year The farm groups included the American Farm Bureau Federation American Soybean Association National Cattlemens Association National Corn Growers Association National Cotton Council National Pork Producers Council and the US Rice Producers Legislative Group The statement said Congress should not modify the 1985 farm bill so the law might have its intended impact of making agriculture more competitive in export markets while at the same time maintaining farm income We strongly believe American farmers now need predictability and certainty in farm legislation in order to have any opportunity of making proper production and marketing decisions the groups said
6890	Argentine grain growers reduced their estimates for maize and soybean production in the current harvest in the week to yesterday trade sources said Soybean production for 198687 is now estimated to reach between 77 and eight mln tonnes versus 78 to 82 mln tonnes estimated a week ago and eight to 84 mln tonnes estimated in mid-February But even the lowest of those estimates would be 85 to 127 pct greater than last years total of 71 mln tonnes according to official figures and would be a new record The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was a record 37 to 38 mln hectares and increased 108 to 138 pct compared to the 33 mln hectares planted last year The change in yield estimates is due to very high temperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year in the soybean-producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires province The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybean pods empty especially in Cordoba Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops since rainfall was slight in most main soybean-producing areas Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak in Buenos Aires province totalling between one and 10 mm There was no recorded rain in other grain-producing provinces With clear skies and seasonable temperatures fields were able to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recent weeks allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize sunflower and sorghum harvesting Crops were considered in generally good condition though it is still too early to judge whether the intense rains of recent weeks caused any long-term damage The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of the total area planted compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at 358 to 378 mln hectares down two to seven pct from the 385 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest Total production for the current maize harvest is expected to reach between 99 and 101 mln tonnes versus 10 to 102 mln tonnes estimated a week ago The new figure is 211 to 227 pct lower than the 128 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest according to official figures The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct of total planted area versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was two to 22 mln hectares or 299 to 363 pct lower than the record 314 mln hectares planted in the 198586 harvest The current harvests volume was again expected to be between 23 and 26 mln tonnes or 341 to 415 pct lower than last harvests record 41 mln tonnes Yields varied widely from area to area and growers feared that heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll on crops and consequently on total production volume The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct of total planted area compared to four to six pct a week ago Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 12 and 13 mln hectares or 103 to 152 pct lower than the 14 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest Estimates for total sorghum production this harvest remained at 32 to 35 mln tonnes again this week or 167 to 22 pct lower than last harvests total volume of 41 to 42 mln tonnes
6906	Soybeans produced in the United States face a competitive price problem because of the loan rate provisions of the 1985 farm bill US Undersecretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Amstutz told a House Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee hearing that soybeans are caught in a squeeze because the Farm Bill allowed steep cuts in grain loan rates while limiting the soybean reduction As a result he said US-produced soybeans have a price problem in competing with other soybean producing countries Amstutz called the situation a dilemma for the USDA and said we have spent hours in ASCS Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Service looking at this He did not say what may be done to rectify the situation
7037	American soybean producers and processors are hoping the proposed EC tax on vegetable oils and fats will not be imposed but say the US Is prepared to retaliate if it is introduced Wayne Bennett the American Soybean Associations first vice president told a news conference the US Administration would not hesitate to retaliate but both producers and processors were trying to solve the issue through negotiation US Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng said in a letter to EC officials that US Retaliatory measures would cover more than agricultural products if the tax was imposed Bennett said The ASA and National Soybean Processors Association NSPA delegations will meet top West German government officials today and tomorrow to lobby for support Bennett said West Germany Britain the Netherlands Denmark and Portugal oppose the tax but Italy and Belgium seem to have taken a hardline view on the issue Europeans in favour of the tax say it would be to their advantage economically but that is not correct because we would hit back NSPA chairman Jack Reed said This step would be very expensive for all and no one would emerge as a winner if the tax were introduced he said Reed pointed out the US Administration and the soybean industry view the EC proposal as violating the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade The proposed tax also violates the zero duty bindings agreed between the EC and US In 1962 he said Under the zero duty bindings pact US Soybeans and products can be exported to the Community duty-free
7356	Several leading farm-state Congressmen said they will press the US Agriculture Department to implement some kind of marketing loan to make soybeans exports competitive while protecting farm income Speaking at a House grains subcommittee hearing chairman Dan Glickman D-Kan proposed that Congressmen and representatives of soybean growers meet with USDA on the subject in the next two weeks Lets see if we can try to push them USDA to do something without legislation Glickman told the hearing The current soybean loan rate effectively is 456 dlrs per bushel with no income protection or marketing loan David Haggard American Soybean Association ASA president said USDA must make changes in the soybean program The current soybean program gave us the worst of both worlds ASAs Haggard told the hearing The 1987 loan rate is too high relative to corn and is encouraging an expansion of soybean production in South America he said At the same time the US soybean loan rate is too low to provide any income support for soybean farmers Haggard said We need some kind of market loan he added The 1985 farm bill provides authority for the Agriculture Secretary to implement a marketing loan for soybeans but USDA so far has resisted pressure to use the authority Representatives of ASA met earlier this month with USDA but Haggard said USDA officials gave no indication if they would seriously consider offering a marketing loan USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz yesterday said the soybean situation is a dilemna which has been studied extensively by the department But he did not say what if any changes are under consideration In his testimony Haggard indicated there are ways other than a marketing loan which should be considered to help soybean growers such as a so-called producer option payment or a direct payment program Haggard said barring any program changes Commodity Credit Corporation CCC soybean stocks now at 385 mln bu will rise to 500 mln by the end of August A further 100 mln bu of soybeans could be forfeited between September and end-year Thus CCC could own the equivalent of Brazils entire soybean crop by the end of calendar year 1987 Haggard said However Haggard said that the US should be cautious in making soybean program changes that might allow the European Community to challenge the US program under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade GATT He noted that The EC imports one quarter of US soybean production and loss of that market would be devastating The Reagan administration has given mixed signals on whether it believes a marketing loan for soybeans could be successfully challenged in GATT by the EC Haggard said While the ASA position is to support a 502 dlrs per bu loan rate combined with a marketing loan Haggard also endorsed a proposal by Rep Jerry Huckaby D-La which would set a six dlrs per bu loan rate and apply a marketing loan The Huckaby proposal is also supported by the ranking Republican on the House Agriculture committee Rep Edward Madigan of Illinois Subcommittee chairman Glickman endorsed the need to take some action on soybeans but cautioned that the marketing loan could mean a substantial increase in budget costs Glickman noted that the Agriculture Committee must cut one to 15 billion dlrs from its fiscal 1988 budget and therefore must fit any soybean program changes into the overall budget Haggard said at a soybean loan rate of six dlrs per bu combined with a marketing loan the US soybean price might fall to four dlrs per bu initially This would cost the government a maximum of two billion dlrs But he said the costs would decline as market prices recovered
7515	Whether the European Communitys Council of Ministers will approve a proposed tax on vegetable oils that has sparked threats of US retaliation is uncertain an EC official said It is very far from certain that it will go through Sir Roy Denman Head of the EC Delegation in Washington told reporters before he addressed the Foreign Trade Association Denman noted Britain remains opposed to the plan and West Germany has opposed it in the past US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has threatened retaliation if the tax is approved as it would limit US soybean exports to the EC Council action is expected soon Denman said while the EC is willing to negotiate about agriculture in a new round of trade talks it is unwilling to single out export subsidies on a negotiating agenda or put agricultural policy on a special fast track The key to a solution in this area seems to me not in the framing of the GATT General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade wordingbut in tackling government subsidies to farmers on both sides of the Atlantic he said
7625	The West German government expressed support for the US Position in opposing the proposed European Community tax on vegetable oils and fats a US Embassy spokesman said The spokesman speaking from Bonn said We have good reason to think West Germany holds to its resistance to the proposed tax Several top government officials told the American Soybean Association and the National Soybean Processors Association delegations there was no reason for American producers and processors to pay for EC agriculture the spokesman said European agriculture was facing severe problems but both the Community and the US Should work closely within the framework provided by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade he said The delegations will continue their top level meetings in Bonn today but will not issue a statement before returning to the US At the weekend The EC and the US Realised the tax issue would stay on the agenda for several months and there were indications that both sides would have to prepare for some tough negotiations the spokesman said
7700	Grain analysts surveyed by the American Soybean Association ASA projected acreage this year at 591 mln acres of soybeans and 647 mln acres of corn In 1986 farmers planted 615 mln acres of soybeans and 767 mln acres of corn according to the February 9 USDA supplydemand report The USDA is to release its 1987 planting intentions report March 31 The survey included 15 soybean estimates and 13 corn estimates and was released in the March 16 Soybean Update newsletter sent to members Estimates ranged from 560 mln to 630 mln acres of soybeans and 595 mln to 680 mln acres of corn An ASA spokesman said the association plans no survey of farmers planting intentions this year

8213	Winter kill has probably affected West German winter barley and rapeseed to an above average degree this season West German grain trader Alfred C Toepfer said in its latest report It is too soon to assess the extent of the damage but it is likely that northern West German crops are particularly at risk because of insufficient snow cover it said The soil needs to warm up rapidly and moisture content must improve to avoid further delays to spring field work it added
8273	Sen David Pryor D-Ark said he was considering amending the Senate Finance Committees trade bill with a provision to require a marketing loan for soybeans corn and wheat Pryor told the Futures Industry Association that there was great reluctance among members of the Senate Agriculture Committee to reopen the 1985 farm bill and that a marketing loan might have a better chance in the Finance panel The Arkansas senator said the marketing loan -- which in effect allows producers to pay back their crop loans at the world price -- had led to a 300 pct increase in US cotton exports in 14 months and a 72 pct increase in rice exports Pryor serves on both the Senate Finance and Agriculture Committees
8319	Graan Elevator Mij GEM said its balance in port of grains oilseeds and derivatives rose to 70000 tonnes on March 21 compared with 10000 a week earlier after arrivals of 192000 tonnes and discharges of 132000 tonnes last week The balance comprised 25000 tonnes of grains plus oilseeds and 45000 tonnes of derivatives This weeks estimated arrivals total 487000 tonnes of which 107000 are grainsoilseeds and 380000 derivatives The figures cover around 95 pct of Rotterdam traffic in the products concerned
8522	Congress should give the US Agriculture Secretary the authority to keep the 1987 soybean loan rate at the current effective rate of 456 dlrs per bushel in order to help resolve the problem of soybean export competitiveness USDA undersecretary Dan Amstutz said Speaking to reporters following a Senate Agriculture Appropriations hearing Amstutz suggested that one way out of the current soybean program dilemma would be for Congress to allow the loan rate to remain at 456 dlrs He indicated if the loan rate were 456 dlrs USDA could then consider ways to make US soybeans more competitive such as using certificates to further buydown the loan rate Under current law the 1987 soybean loan rate cannot be less than 477 dlrs per bu Amstutz suggestion would be for Congress to change the farm bill to allow USDA to leave the soybean loan rate at 456 dlrs in crop year 1987 rather than increase it to 477 dlrs The 1986 effective loan rate is 456 dlrs because of the 43 pct Gramm-Rudman budget cut Amstutz stressed that a major factor in any decision on soybean program changes will be the budget costs He told the hearing that the problem in soybeans is that the US loan rate provides an umbrella to foreign production and causes competitive problems for US soybeans Asked about the American Soybean Associations request for some form of income support Amstutz said the competitive problem is the most severe He said USDA is still studying the situation and no resolution has yet been found
9058	US corn acreage this year is likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassed acreage reductions of the 1983 PIK year and could rank as one of the lowest corn plantings in the United States in sixty years Agriculture Department officials said USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31 Agriculture Department analysts said next weeks figures will likely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres down 22 pct from last years plantings of 833 mln acres Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings US corn production will also decrease significantly Analysts said 1987 corn production could drop by over one billion bushels to around seven billion bushels Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grains program along with 19 mln acres enrolled in the conservation program will cause acreage to plummet Department feedgrain analysts said Theres no question that there will be a sharp decrease in corn acreage one said Its difficult for any farmer to not go along with the program this year Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year but at a much slower rate of around four pct USDA analysts said Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below they said compared to last years level of 615 mln acres If analysts unofficial estimates prove correct then the drop in us corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 when farmers idled 22 mln acres in the Payment-In-Kind program Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983 A severe drought that summer in major producing states caused yields to tumble and final crop production to total only 42 billion bushels Given normal weather conditions this year USDA analysts said the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billion bushels down from last years crop of 83 billion bushels This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significant reduction in production an analyst said A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual US corn usage so surplus stocks while not decreasing would not increase significantly a specialist said High producing corn belt states are expected to show the greatest acreage reductions based upon historical participation in government programs analysts said In contrast soybean acreage is likely to be cut the most in marginal producing areas of the southeast and the western corn belt a USDA soybean analyst said Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge he said Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts in higher-producing delta areas Soybean production could drop fractionally from last years 20 billion bushels to 18 to 19 billion he said US soybean acreage after soaring to 714 mln acres in 1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that has steadily declined in the 1980s US corn acreage with the exception of 1983 has been in the low to mid 80-mln acre range for the past 10 years The highest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA has kept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mln acres and obtained average yields of 265 bushels per acre Last year US farmers obtained record corn yields averaging 1193 bushels per acre We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billion bushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so an analyst said Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres as long as government program provisions remain the same analysts said Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required to set aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligible for payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15 pct of their acreage To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres we would have to provide more incentives an analyst said

9521	Argentine grain producers again reduced their estimates for the total yield of the 198687 soybean crop which will begin to be harvested in mid-April trade sources said They said growers now forecast soybean production this season at between 75 and 78 mln tonnes down from last weeks estimate of 77 to eight mln tonnes and the 80 to 84 mln tonnes forecast in mid-February The new forecast is still higher than last seasons record total production Private sources put 198586 production at a record 72 to 73 mln tonnes -- 42 to 64 pct lower than the new forecast for the current crop The official figure for 198586 is 71 mln tonnes 56 to 99 pct below this seasons new estimates Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean pods in the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe provinces and northern Buenos Aires The crop since January has been hit by high temperatures and inadequate rainfall Growers fear they may find more empty pods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 37 to 38 mln hectares 108 to 138 pct higher than the 198586 record of 334 mln hectares The state of the crop continued to be good in general until last week but intense heavy rains since could have caused damage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm Where the rains were less heavy they were considered beneficial although too late to improve yield estimates The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops in southern Buenos Aires province but are not expected to influence production forecasts In other areas especially western Buenos Aires where rainfall was more than 200 mm parts of the sunflower maize and sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week by rains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba La Pampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios The area sown with maize this season was between 358 and 378 mln hectares two to seven pct less than the 385 mln hectares in 198586 The yield of 198687 maize continued to be forecast at between 99 and 101 mln tonnes This estimate is 198 to 202 pct lower than the 124 to 126 mln tonnes at which private sources put 198586 production and 211 to 227 pct lower than the official 128 mln tonnes The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of the area sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Aires although at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage is impossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days of sunshine dries the fields The area sown this season was 20 to 22 mln hectares down 299 to 363 pct on last years record 314 mln hectares Sunflowerseed 198687 production is still forecast at 23 to 26 mln tonnes 341 to 415 pct below the 198586 record of 41 mln tonnes The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by the rains advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and starting in La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown The area sown was 123 to 130 mln hectares 103 to 152 pct less than the 145 mln hectares the previous season Yield estimates remained at 32 to 35 mln tonnes 167 to 22 pct down on 198586 production of 41 to 42 mln tonnes
9617	US soybean lobbyists and congressional aides criticized a proposal from a senior Agriculture Department official that Congress allow the US soybean loan level to be officially lowered to 456 dlrs per bushel next year I dont know who in Congress would propose that happening Politically it would be totally unacceptable an aide to a senior farm-state senator said USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said this week that Congress should give USDA authority to keep the soybean loan at its current effective rate of 456 dlrs per bushel rather than increasing it to its minimum allowed level of 477 dlrs Im convinced that Congress will not go along with this American Soybean Association President Dave Haggard said Amstutz told reporters following a senate hearing that if the soybean loan rate were 456 dlrs USDA could then consider ways to make US soybeans more competitive His comments were seen as possibly indicating what the  the administrations position is in the debate over what should be done to make soybeans competitive and at the same time protect soybean farmers income Using soybean specific certificates to further buydown the loan rate or implementation of a marketing loan have been pointed to as the most effective ways to get soybean prices competitive USDA secretary Richard Lyng however continues to maintain his opposition to a marketing loan saying such a move would be too costly There will be alot of other options that will be considered before Congress looks at that one the Amstutz proposal said Bill OConner aide to Rep Edward Madigan R-Ill ranking minority leader of the Agriculture Committee Anybody representing large groups of soybean producers would not be very excited about supporting a lower soybean loan OConner said Congress may very likely look at the soybean loan and decide that they cannot increase it from its current 502 dlr basic rate but that there has to be something mandated to increase soybeans competitiveness David Graves aide to Sen Thad Cochran R-Miss said Cochran a staunch supporter of a soybean marketing loan would support a soybean loan of 502 or 477 dlrs with a certificate buydown Graves said
