235	Indonesias agriculture sector will grow by just 10 pct in calendar 1987 against an estimated 24 pct in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or declines the US Embassy said in a report Production of Indonesias staple food rice is forecast to fall to around 263 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 2658 mln tonnes in 1986 according to the annual report on Indonesias agricultural performance The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 267 mln tonnes with a forecast 273 mln tonnes output in 1987 The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 15 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 169 mln tonnes in 1986 because of a drawdown on stocks Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane rubber and copra show little or no gain the report says The modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans palm oil and palm kernels Constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds limited fertile land insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops the report underlines The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as wereng or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties and to use lower-yielding more resistant rice types The government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee tea rubber plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 70 pct in 1987 to 145 mln tonnes from 135 mln with exports rising to an estimated 720000 tonnes from 695000 tonnes in 1986 the report says But while production of soybeans in 198788 Oct-Sept will rise to 1075 mln tonnes from 980000 in 198687 imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant The report says that imports of wheat soybeans soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last Septembers 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand The report said that Indonesias overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s It compares with 19 pct growth in 1985 and 67 pct in 1984 The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump

1535	A leaf disease affecting seven pct of Sri Lankas rubber plantations may reduce output this year and raise currently depressed prices industry officials and researchers told Reuters About 2900 hectares of rubber planted with the Rubber Research Institute RRI clone 103 have been hit by the fungus corenes pora which attacks the roots of the tree and kills the leaves The disease was first discovered about six months ago Trade sources say prices might boom once again if the crisis leads to output below the 1987 target of 143000 tonnes Last years output is estimated at between 133000 and 135000 tonnes Researchers say the fungus could spread to other rubber clones if no immediate action is taken The RRI is considering asking estates to remove the trees seriously affected by the fungus because it was too late to use chemicals to kill the disease an Institute spokesman said Senior industry and research officials met yesterday at Padukka east of here to discuss ways of controlling the fungus which is affecting estates mostly belonging to the State Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board The two state-owned groups account for 30 pct of rubber land with the balance belonging to small private producers with a total of 145600 hectares The RRIC 103 is a new clone propagated by the Research Institute as high yielding and recommended two years ago for planting Only the two state groups seriously planted these clones while smallholders preferred the low-yielding but older PBX Malaysian clones Officials at yesterdays crisis meeting said it was decided to uproot only some of the affected trees while others would be treated They declined to comment on other decisions taken Trade sources said supplies had improved in the past week but prices had hit their lowest since last December If there is a shortage of rubber prices are bound to rise a spokesman for a company buying on behalf of the Soviet Union said Rubber prices particularly crepe fell sharply by about four rupees a kilo between December and March The best crepe one-X traded at 2368 rupees a kilo averaged 1975 at this weeks auction Sheet prices fell by a rupee in the same period Quantities offered at the auction also fell to an average of 300 tonnes per auction last month from 800 tonnes in December because of wintering in early February in producing areas Over 550 tonnes were offered at this Tuesdays auction with the supply position showing improvements Trade sources said the smaller availability of rubber last month did not raise prices as on previous occasions Some factors like less storage space from excess stocks meant we could not buy much at the auction until we disposed of the rubber we already had one buyer said Other sources said there were few forward contracts and speculative buying last month while delays in steamer arrivals aggravated the problem European buyers delayed their purchases because of winter closures of factories and also in the hope that prices would ease further They said another problem that could hit the industry is the dry spell in producing areas If the inter-monsoonal rains expected in late MarchApril are delayed we would have further shortages one official said But this again could benefit prices a buyer said
10615	Malaysia said it expects a natural rubber shortage in April and May because of the effects of current wintering on rubber trees The expected shortage and stronger demand for rubber goods especially condoms and surgical gloves by consumers is likely to push up prices the Malaysian Rubber Exchange and Licensing Board said in its latest monthly bulletin During the annual wintering period from February to April rubber trees shed their leaves and latex output is very low
10729	Sri Lanka will uproot rubber trees that are more than two years old and affected by the leaf disease corynespora the head of the governments Rubber Research Institute told Reuters Rodney De Mel said affected trees less than two years old would undergo base-budding -- attaching a clone as close as possible to the trunks base and cutting off the top of the tree once the bud has taken Uprooted or base-budded trees mature later causing an output loss estimated at 350 kilos per hectare from the sixth year when they begin producing About 7000 acres are planted with the high yielding RIC 103 variety the clone afflicted by corynespora Only about 2000 acres are affected by the disease which causes leaves to fall off De Mel said Sri Lanka has 508000 acres planted with rubber trees De Mel said the disease was detected in nurseries as early as in middle 1985 but it was only in August-September 1986 that it became widespread The Institute is conducting a survey to determine how many trees will be uprooted or base-budded Healthy trees will be sprayed and remain under observation TP Lilaratne head of the governments Rubber Controller Department which monitors the industry told Reuters replanting and base-budding would have to be undertaken before late May when the monsoon rains begin De Mel said clones in the nurseries which are susceptible to corynespora identified as RIC 103 RIC 52 RIC 104 RIC 106 RIC 107 and RIC 118 will be uprooted and burned The same procedures will be undertaken for the foreign clones indentified as NAB 12 RRIM 725 FX25 PPN 2444 PPN 2447 KRS 21 and PPN 2058 Lilaratne said the susceptible clones would be replaced by PB 86 RRIM 600 RRIC 110 RRIC 121 RIC 100 and RIC 102 These six varieties would also be used to replace trees uprooted or base-budded De Mel said Lilaratne said planters would receive 10000 rupees per hectare for replanting and plants would be free of charge But no compensation is contemplated at the moment he added De Mel said a drought in Sri Lanka has helped control the spread of the disease The drought has not stopped the disease but probably helped in some way because trees have not been affected in areas that are dry he said Brokers said the disease had not affected prices because it has not caused a drop in production Prices for the best latex crepe at the Colombo auction last week firmed to 2019 rupees per kilo from 2005 rupees at the previous sale

11224	Consuming countries chastened by the collapse of International Tin Council ITC price support operations in 1985 are insisting more than ever before that commodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they are serving a Reuter survey showed They want price ranges to be more responsive to market trends - to avoid overstimulating output and straining the accords support operations - and intervention rules that avoid the risk of exports by non-members undermining the pacts Consumers and producers mindful of ITC buffer stock losses have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned a generalised approach to commodity price stabilisation and prefer to assess each commodity case by case the survey showed The International Cocoa Organization ICCO last week set precise limits on what the Buffer Stock Manager BSM could do under the new agreement It imposed daily and weekly purchase limits prohibited the BSM from operating on futures markets and stipulated after consumer insistence that up to 15 pct of total buffer stock purchases could be of non-member cocoa This will help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia the worlds fourth largest producer undermining the market The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the Buffer Stock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades A new International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA was adopted earlier this month in Geneva Importing and exporting countries agreed several changes to make the reference price more responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions under which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance operations Direct cash contributions from members will fund buffer stock purchases Bank financing was a particular feature of the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling Legal wrangles continue Recent International Coffee Organization ICO negotiations in London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that agreements reflect market reality commodity analysts said Consumers and a small group of producers argued that objective criteria should be used to define export quota shares which would have meant a reduction in the share of Brazil the worlds leading producer Brazil wanted to maintain its previous quota share of 30 pct The talks broke down and although an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term negotiations on export quota distribution as remote International agreements exist for sugar and wheat These do not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for discussions on possible future economic agreements collect statistics and draw up market analyses Analysts said differences between sugar exporting countries have held up any progress towards an accord with economic teeth while sheer competition between major exporters amid a world grain glut militate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat An alternative focus for commodity discussions are international study groups made up of governments with advice from industry such as those for lead and zinc and rubber The UN Common fund for commodities with a planned directly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs has failed to become operational because neither the US Nor the Soviet Union has ratified it US Officials in Washington said the US Doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives citing the lack of widespread support US Officials in Washington and Malaysian officials in Kuala Lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commodity pact case by case US Officials said it has been willing to study individual cases for economically sound market-oriented commodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests We see little to be gained by attempting to increase the price of a commodity whose long-term trend is downward official Administration policy states The US Currently belongs to only two international commodity agreements that have economic clauses - the International Coffee Agreement ICA and INRA - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat pacts The US Did not join the International Cocoa Agreement because it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and not designed to protect the interests of consuming countries the State Department said US Officials singled out the INRA as the one commodity agreement that seems to be working US Negotiators were successful in getting other members of the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment mechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect market trends and also to continue the accord as a market oriented agreement US Officials said Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they have consistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts on the merits of each case Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur his country the worlds top producer of rubber tin and palm oil decides its participation in international commodity pacts case by case Malaysia is a member of the Association of Tin Producing Countries ATPC which produce 65 pct of world tin The ATPC launched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96000 tonnes for a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50000 from 70000 Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture and delegate to cocoa wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron told Reuters in London Agreements with economic clauses to stabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were close to market reality if there was full participation by producers and consumers and if participants were prepared to take their obligations in the framework of the agreement seriously But Baron added No real sanctions are available for a country that doesnt stick to its obligationsThe German approach is sceptical We dont think agreements are the best instrument to help developing countries They were never meant to be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how developing countries often interpret them Traditionally Britain has always been supportive of commodity agreements reflecting its strong links with Third World producing countries But recently demands for more stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the need for intellectual honesty and objective criteria have grown British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree of transparency and do not contain the risk of open-ended borrowing that occurred in the tin pact they said UK Delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to reflect changes in market structure and price trends rather than dictate what prices should be A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges price realism in commodity pacts adding high prices inflate supply A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourable to commodity pacts France a large consumer and producer of sugar favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real market situation particularly regarding stocks Indonesias Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja told Reuters in Jakarta These agreements can work as long as the problems are cyclicalBut its another matter when there are structural problemsBut we are still committed to commodity agreements as an act of faith Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producers cannot afford not to give their backing to commodity agreements The political will is not there on the part of some consumers to make agreements work Martinez Cuenca said The head of the economics department in the Brazilian Foreign Ministry Sebastiao do Rego Barros told Reuters an agreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market reality If you have an agreement such as coffee with a system of quotas with a link between prices practised inside the pact and actual market prices it can work UNCTAD spokesman Graham Shanley said consuming countries realise steady export earnings enhance developing countries ability to service debt and mean greater demand for industrialised nations capital goods

3438	The leaf disease corenes pora which has affected some rubber trees in Sri Lanka and Indonesia is likely to force a cut in supply and push up depressed prices a Malaysian rubber disease researcher said Trees with leaves hit by the fungus disease cannot be saved and must be felled Chee Kheng Hoy Head of the Crop Protection and Microbiology Division in the Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia RRIM told Reuters He was commenting on a Reuter report which said corenes pora had hit seven pct of Sri Lankas plantations and may cause output to drop below its 1987 target of 143000 tonnes The report said the Sri Lankan Rubber Research Institute may ask estates to remove trees seriously affected by the disease and added that most estates affected belong to the State Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board Chee said corenes pora is an old disease which only affects certain rubber clones in Sri Lanka and Indonesia and that further use of such clones must be discontinued Clones not resistant to the disease are the Rubber Research Institute of Sri Lanka clone 103 Indonesias PPN 2058 2444 2447 and PR 265 and Malaysias RRIM 725 he said Chee said corenes pora affected trees from the RRIM 725 clone planted in Malaysia several years ago but had been curbed after use of such clones were discontinued Fungicide may be used to curb the disease which also affects leaves of 30 other species of plants but experience has proven that it is uneconomical and expensive he added The disease is extremely difficult to control If it is not curbed in the two affected countries their rubber output may drop and prices can rise he said He added that the RRIM was aware of the disease outbreak in Sri Lanka and was monitoring the situation
3748	Negotiators at a United Nations conference on natural rubber are making slow progress towards reaching an agreement delegates said The conference which began Monday is widely seen as the final effort to adopt a new International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA before the current one expires in October Some 40 producing and consuming countries are taking part in the two-week meeting This is the fourth such conference in nearly two years Delegates said both sides still appeared divided on the key issue of the price adjustment mechanism Consumers want frequent price reviews at 12 month intervals instead of 18 months as at present a proposal currently rejected by producers And while consumers press for the price adjustment to be automatic producers have resisted reducing the role of the International Rubber Organization Council in the price adjustment procedure Conference chairman Manaspas Xuto of Thailand has said it was imperative to settle outstanding issues this week so that technical drafting work can be done next week
4405	There has been slight progress towards reaching a rubber pact the chairman of a United Nations conference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreeement INRA Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said There has been some slight progress but it is not the end of the road yet he said The conference which began Monday is seen as the last effort to adopt an accord to replace the current one which expires in October Some 40 producing and consuming countries are taking part in the two-week meeting Xuto said if the key outstanding issues are not resolved by tomorrow he would hold weekend meetings At the beginning of the conference the fourth such meeting in nearly two years Xuto said it was imperative to settle those issues this week so that technical drafting work can be done next week Conference sources said it is highly unlikely that producers will accept a pact that will provide for any possible downward adjustment of the floor price as proposed by consumers under certain circumstances The sources said this means that any possible adjustment would centre on the reference price and the may buy or may sell and must buy or must sell levels without changing the lower indicative price or floor price of 150 MalaysianSingapore cents a kilo in the present pact The present five-day average of the indicator price is around 192 MalaysianSingapore cents Consumers are seeking an adjustment of the reference price set in the current accord at 20166 MalaysianSingapore cents a kilo and of the lower indicative price if the buffer stock currently 360000 tonnes rises to 450000 tonnes Consumers want price reviews at 12-month intervals instead of the 18 at present and the price revision mechanism to respond automatically to market trends At present if the market price has been above or below the reference price for six months the reference price is revised by five pct or by an amount decided by the International Natural Rubber Organisation council Consumers say that in these circumstances the adjustment be automatic at five pct or more Producers have resisted reducing the role of the council in the price adjustment procedure and have expressed concern that changes proposed by consumers would weaken the present pact
4824	Negotiations on a new International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA are approaching the make-or-break point and prospects for a future pact appear to be in the balance delegates said Manaspas Xuto of Thailand chairman of the INRA renegotiation conference is holding consultations with a small group of producers and consumers to try to resolve major outstanding issues When the talks began on Monday Xuto said those issues should be settled by the end of the first week to allow time to draft an agreement during the second week The talks are due to last until March 20 Xuto said There is nothing concrete yet but the atmosphere is good The discussions are expected to continue late into the night and Xuto said he may hold weekend meetings Delegates said negotiations now focus on the degree to which price adjustments should be automatic At present if the market price has been above or below the reference price set at 20166 MalaysianSingapore cents a kilo in the current agreement for six months the reference price is revised by five pct or by an amount decided by the International Natural Rubber Organisation council Consumers are asking that in these circumstances the adjustment be automatic at five pct or more Producers want the council to have the last word and have resisted reducing its role in the price adjustment procedure Delegates said there seems to be optimism about settling another issue -- that of the floor price It now appears that consumers may consider dropping their insistence of a downward adjustment of the floor price called the lower indicative price under certain circumstances This means that any possible compromise would centre on the reference price and the may buy or may sell and must buy or must sell levels without changing the lower indicative price -- which is set at 150 MalaysianSingapore cents in the current pact Delegates said that in exchange for consumer flexibility on the floor price question producers may consider agreeing to another consumer proposal for more frequent price reviews -- at 12 month intervals instead of 18 at present
4941	The US Has dropped its insistence that the floor price in a new International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA be revised downward under certain circumstances conference sources said The surprise conciliatory move by the US Meets one of the producers main concerns -- that the floor price or lower indicative price remain unchanged they said It is not clear however whether all consuming countries will follow suit as a number of them in particular Britain West Germany and Belgium appeared to have strong reservations the sources added The group of consumers has been seeking an adjustment of the lower indicative price set at 150 MalaysianSingapore cents a kilo in the present pact if the buffer stock currently 360000 tonnes rises to 450000 tonnes The sources said the question of to what extent price adjustments should be automatic remains a problem Conference chairman Manaspas Xuto of Thailand has been holding consultations with producers and consumers throughout the day The consumers group is now holding a separate meeting ahead of further consultations within the presidents group tonight

7304	A new International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA will be formally adopted tomorrow chairman of the negotiating conference Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said The successful negotiation of the new agreement represents a significant step forward in international economic cooperation he told a news conference The new INRA is to replace the current one which expires in October Delegates at the renegotiation conference held under the auspices of the UN Conference on Trade and Development UNCTAD reached agreement over the central elements of a new accord last weekend Xuto said the new INRA retains the reference price -- of 20166 MalaysianSingapore cents per kilo -- and indicative prices set in the present pact Price levels will continue to be expressed in the joint MalaysianSingapore currency he added The new agreement also maintains the basic structure of price ranges -- the may sell and may buy points at plus and minus 15 pct of the reference price as well as the must sell and must buy zones at plus and minus 20 pct of it Xuto said the new pact maintains the same objectives that were set in the present accord The most important of these are to stabilise prices and to achieve a balanced growth between demand and supply he said The buffer stock remains the sole instrument of market intervention for price stabilisation and its maximum capacity is unchanged at 550000 tonnes Xuto added At this months session which was the fourth attempt in two years to negotiate a new INRA the main issue to be resolved concerned the mechanism for adjusting the reference price It was agreed to conduct reviews of the reference price every 15 months -- instead of the current 18-month intervals The extent of the adjustment was also modified Under the present agreement if the daily market indicator price has been above the upper intervention may sell price currently 231 MalaysianSingapore cents or below the lower intervention price may buy price 171 cents at present for six months the reference price is then revised by five pct or whatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council decides Under the new pact the adjustment under these circumstances will be five pct unless the Council decides on a higher adjustment Similarly when buffer stock purchases or sales amount to 300000 tonnes there would be an automatic adjustment of three pct under the new accord unless the Council decides on a higher percentage Throughout the talks which began on March 9 producers had strongly opposed a consumer proposal to lower the reference price and the lower indicative price or floor price of 150 cents in the present pact if the buffer stock currently 360000 tonnes reached 450000 tonnes The proposal initiated by the US was withdrawn last Friday setting the stage for compromise at the weekend Since then negotiators have worked on the finer details of the new pact On the question of conditions for entry into force of the new INRA Xuto said it was tentatively agreed that governments accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world imports approved or ratified the new agreement before it became operational The present agreement had a figure of 80 pct
7873	A new International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA was formally adopted by a United Nations Conference today The new accord is due to replace the current one which expires in October Conference chairman Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said the formal adoption represented a historic moment The latest round of talks which began March 9 represented the fourth attempt to negotiate a new INRA in nearly two years Xuto described the negotiations as by no means easy and we often faced problems The new pact is due to enter into force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting for 75 pct of world net exports and 75 pct of net imports The new INRA will enter into force definitively when governments accounting for at least 80 pct of net exports and 80 pct of net imports have ratified it It will be open for signature from May 1 to December 31 this year It is expected that provisional entry into force will take at least 12 to 14 months from now delegates said During the hiatus between the two agreements buffer stock operations will be suspended but the International Natural Rubber Council will remain in place Xuto told the conference both the 1979 agreement and its successor were aimed at meeting the needs of producers and consumers of natural rubber over the long term Both had interest in stabilising prices and supplies Xuto added He also praised the spirit of give and take that prevailed throughout this session Ahmed Farouk of Malaysia speaking on behalf of producers said the conclusion of the new pact showed that the mutuality of interests between producers and consumers is now as valid as it was when negotiations of the first agreement began in the 1970s Farouk said the ability to manage inventories on the basis of predictable stable prices is a vital consideration for multinational tire companies whether or not consuming countries as a whole claimed to be no longer so seriously concerned about security of the rubber supply He said producers considered that the 1979 agreement had served the purpose for which it was created Farouk urged consuming countries to promote early accession to the new pact to avoid an undue gap between the old and the new Gerard Guillonneau of France speaking for consumers agreed that the 1979 agreement had worked relatively well But as economic conditions had changed he said consumers had been led to make proposals for improving its functioning He added that the adoption of the new agreement attests to the importance of rubber and confidence in the rubber industry
8060	The new International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA like the 1979 pact will use a buffer stock as the sole instrument for market intervention -- excluding export quotas or production controls The new INRA was adopted yesterday at a session held under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development UNCTAD In many respects the main features in the new pact resemble those contained in the present one The reference price currently 20166 MalaysianSingapore cts per kilo will be maintained -- unless between now and October 22 when the 1979 INRA expires the average of the daily market indicator price remains above the upper intervention may sell price 231 cts or below the lower intervention may buy price 171 cts for six months If this happened -- but delegates said it was unlikely considering that the present indicator price averages 196 cts -- the price would be revised under the current accord by five pct or by whatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council decides The new reference price would then be taken over for the new agreement Under the same circumstances in the new pact the reference price would be automatically revised by five pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage Similarly if buffer stock purchases or sales amounting to 300000 tonnes have been made since the last revision the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage Another change introduced in the new INRA is that price reviews will be held at 15-month intervals instead of 18 Those changes are intended to make the reference price more responsive to market trends As in the present accord the may buy and may sell levels are set at plus or minus 15 pct of the reference price and the must buy and must sell levels at 20 pct of it The lower and upper indicative prices floor and ceiling prices will remain fixed at 150 and 270 cents unless the Council decides to revise them at reviews held every 30 months During the negotiations consumers abandoned a proposal that the floor price be adjusted downward if the buffer stock currently 360000 tonnes rose to 450000 tonnes The maximum size of the buffer stock in the new pact is the same as under the present one -- 400000 tonnes with provision for an additional contingency buffer stock of 150000 tonnes Under the new accord the contingency buffer stock will be brought in at 152 cts to defend the floor price At last Fridays session Ahmed Farouk speaking for producers said producing nations considered that the 1979 pact had served the purpose for which it had been created Gerard Guillonneau of France who spoke for consumers agreed that the current agreement had worked relatively well Asked about the chances of success of the new INRA delegates noted that for nearly its whole life the 1979 accord had maintained the average price above the must buy level They said the agreement until now did not appear to have encouraged excessive production of rubber In addition provisions for borrowing to finance the buffer stock have now been eliminated ruling out speculation It is a sort of middle-of-the-road agreement one delegate said The new pact will be open for signature at UN Headquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year To become operational it will require ratification by countries accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world imports Delegates estimate that this will take 12 to 14 months from now During the hiatus between the two agreements the International Natural Rubber Council will remain in place The pact will enter into force definitively when governments accounting for 80 pct of world exports and 80 pct of world imports have ratified it

9203	Governments of major Asian producing countries have welcomed the conclusion of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA but growers and traders are unhappy with the development according to views polled by Reuter correspondents Officials in Malaysia Indonesia and Thailand which produce the bulk of the worlds rubber said they expected the new pact to continue to stabilise prices and help their rubber industries remain viable in the long-term But traders and growers said they were against the new pact because its buffer stock mechanism was likely to interefere with free market forces and prevent sharp rubber price rises The new INRA to replace the current one which expires on October 22 was formally adopted by most of the worlds producers and consumers in Geneva last Friday It will be open for signature at the UN Headquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year and will enter into force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting for 75 pct of world rubber exports and 75 pct of world imports Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said the formal adoption of a new pact had dispelled fears of liquidation of some 360000 tonnes of INRA buffer stock rubber and a possible depression of prices He expressed confidence that the new INRA would continue to keep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as prices rose or fell through its buffer stock system Malaysia was also happy that in the new INRA financing of purchases for the normal buffer stock of 400000 tonnes and a contingency buffer stock of 150000 tonnes would be done through direct cash contributions from members he said Under the existing pact members can borrow from banks to finance INRAs buffer stock purchases This has been viewed with concern by some members who fear the INRA may become indebted and ultimately face collapse like the International Tin Agreement This will ensure the buffer stock operation is carried out without any financial encumbrance Lim said Malaysia the worlds largest producer was seeking cabinet approval to join the new INRA and hoped other producers and consumers would also become members he said Officials in Jakarta said the new pact would bring benefit to Indonesias rubber industrys by stabilising prices It was unlikely to collapse like the tin agreement because its new financial provisions had been tightened they said Thai officials told Reuters they were optimistic the new pact was viable because it strictly limited the extent of debt the INRA buffer stock manager might commit to his market operations Malaysian growers however said they preferred a free rubber market because an INRA had a tendency to keep prices at levels that were only acceptable to consumers With the INRAs ability to keep prices at a certain stable level consumers are assured of rubber at almost a fixed price while producers may never see sharp price rises a Malaysian Rubber Producers Council source told Reuters Producers also wanted a free rubber market without the overhang of a 360000 tonne INRA buffer stock which had psychologically prevented price rises he said State plantation officials in Sri Lanka said prices had been depressed since INRAs inception and the creation of a buffer stock and they seemed unlikely to rise Sri Lanka should not be a member of the INRA because it was expensive to maintain a buffer stock they added Traders in the region meanwhile said prices might be pressured by the new pact in the long term as its potential to stabilise prices and buffer stock capacity would spur producers to produce more Most Malaysian and Singapore traders said the new pacts conclusion had little impact on prices and it was unlikely to allow sharp price fluctuations in future The 360000 tonnes in the INRA buffer stock must be liquidated and a free market returned a Malaysian trader said Japanese traders said the new pact had a chance for success as most world producers and consumers had adopted it but they questioned the ability of some financially-strapped producers to finance buffer stock operations
