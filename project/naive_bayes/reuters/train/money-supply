13157	The Federal Open Market Committee at its February 10-11 meeting voted nine to one to maintain the then-existing degree of reserve restraint minutes showed The FOMC issued an asymmetric inter-meeting policy directive which gave greater possibility to firmer rather than easier policy The Committee set a six to seven pct January through March annualized growth target for M-2 and M-3 and no M-1 goal At the prior meeting in mid-December the FOMC set a seven pct target for M-2 and M-3 for November through March The February FOMC kept the four to eight pct Federal funds rate reference range for policy as in other recent meetings At a telephone conference on February 23 committee members discussed the possible implications of the decisions reached in Paris for US intervention in foreign exchange markets No conclusions were contained in the minutes In its inter-meeting policy directive the February FOMC said that somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable depending on the behavior of the aggregates taking into account the strength of the business expansion developments in foreign exchange markets progress against inflation and conditions in domestic and international credit markets The February FOMC voted nine to one for an unchanged policy Thomas Melzer St Louis Federal Reserve Bank president favored some tightening of reserve conditions He noted the strong growth in bank loans in November through January and the firm federal funds rate that had prevailed despite the extraordinary pace of reserve growth He also cited the recent declines in the dollars value Finally looking ahead Melzer pointed out the potential for a further rise in inflationary expectations He believed that prompt restraints might avert the need for more substantial tightening later Regarding inter-meeting policy adjustments the FOMC minutes showed the members generally felt that policy implementation should be especially alert to the potential need for some firming of reserve conditions In this view the FOMC said somewhat greater reserve restraint would be warranted if monetary growth did not slow in line with current expectations and there were concurrent indications of intensifying inflationary pressures against the background of stronger economic data One indication of potential price pressure might be a further tendency for the dollar to weaken The minutes showed that one member presumably Melzer preferred a directive that did not contemplate any easing during the weeks ahead However most of the members did not want to rule out the possibility of some slight easing during the inter-meeting period although they did not view the conditions for such a move as likely to emerge The FOMC members assumed that future fluctuations in the dollars value would not be of sufficient magnitude to have any significant effect on the Feds economic projections In addition they anticipated that considerable progress would be made in reducing the federal budget deficit

13949	Bundesbank council member Lothar Mueller said the bank has not given up its money supply policy and that restraining money supply growth does not always mean pushing up interest rates Mueller said in an article for the Boersen Zeitung financial daily that a monetary policy which took into account exchange rate expectations and capital flows could not be confused with an exchange rate oriented policy The article followed international press speculation that the Bundesbank had abandoned money supply targetting in favour of an exchange rate policy Mueller a member of the Bundesbank council in his position as president of the regional state central bank in Bavaria noted that the Bundesbanks decision in January to cut leading interest rates amid continuing strong monetary growth had led some people to think it was dropping monetary targetting Simply to ignore the external economic context would be risky and dangerous for monetary policy he explained Mueller said the cuts in official interest rates had put an end to interest rate speculation The Bundesbank could now assume that upward pressure on the mark would ease and currency inflows slow down Lower money market rates achieved by widening short and long term interest rate differentials also encouraged investors to re-invest funds parked in liquid accounts Mueller said The measures therefore aimed clearly at bringing monetary growth back onto the desired path he said Finally of course and there is no need to keep this quiet the cut in interest rates was also in line with the changed economic situation of the last few months he added All in all the Bundesbank in no way abandoned its money supply policy with the January discount rate cut despite suppositions to the contrary Mueller said Keeping money supply developments in check is not always synonymous with raising interest rates especially when excessive liquidity due to inflows from abroad rather than growth in bank credits is the cause of rising monetary holdings of non-banks Mueller said Now that West Germany no longer ran large external deficits other concepts were needed for monetary policy Mueller said it would be both difficult and dangerous for monetary policy to pursue a specific markdollar exchange rate In any case the exchange rate partly depends on US Currency and budgetary policy and the US Economy he said But an exchange rate orientation would also mean the end of a strict stability policy because both interest rates and liquidity would be affected by required currency intervention and could no longer be steered autonomously by the Bundesbank Even interest rates are not in the centre of the Bundesbanks considerations but reflect competition and other market conditions Mueller said A cut in bank liquidity will not directly influence central bank money stock the Bundesbanks main money supply indicator This does not reflect banking liquidity but the liquidity of industry and households which cannot be directly reached with the Bundesbanks instruments Mueller said The less dependent non-banks are on bank credits the harder it is to steer money supply This has increasingly been the case recently because non-banks have received considerable sums from current account surpluses and capital imports If the Bundesbank had tried to brake the money supply rise with higher interest rates as would have been appropriate if credit was growing excessively it would not only have missed its target but probably even set off further inflows he said Mueller said growth in money supply was still too high In the last three months money stock grew at an annual rate of seven pct down from 10 pct in the previous quarter The growth curve has therefore come closer to the three to six pct 1987 target corridor for central bank money stock growth pointing to the success of the current policy he said But high monetary stocks can be a warning sign and there should be no change in priorities Monetary policy must be first and foremost stability policy and successful stability policy is money supply policy -- nothing else he said

14770	Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German economic growth In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs here Poehl said It would be an extremely risky policy to aim for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit He said the United States could face a vicious circle of depreciation inflation and more depreciation if it took that route Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet US Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy accelerating tax cuts cutting interest rates and tolerating above-target money supply growth He said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to the beginning of this year but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the West German parliament But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could accept on exports from a rising mark he said Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about one-third of its gross national product so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home A further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth he said Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade had given some extra leeway But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct not the reported negative inflation rates last year and West Germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments For the time being we will have to focus our policy more on the external side and we can live with a more expansionary money supply But we must be very careful he said He said he shared some of the US Concern about Japans trade surpluses which affected European countries as well as the United States Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries saying the importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level and that further changes would damage growth he said This was a remarkable change in attitude especially on the part of our American colleagues he said But he said there was still a danger that the correction of the dollars value could overshoot

2554	US money supply growth is slowing down rapidly and some economists believe that all three of the Federal Reserves main monetary aggregates may even have contracted in February A contraction is unlikely to be a major concern for the Fed especially as it would follow a long period of torrid growth but it could give the central bank extra leeway in the weeks ahead if it decided that a relaxation of monetary policy was justified on account of weakness in the economy M-1 money supply for the week ended February 23 reported today rose 19 billion dlrs to 7385 billion but preliminary forecasts call for a drop next week of around two billion dlrs The monthly average in January was 7371 billion dlrs M-1 makes up about a quarter of M-2 and a fifth of M-3 With other components of M-2 such as money-market deposit accounts and small time deposits also falling the stage is set for falls in the broader aggregates too economists say M-1 has been largely discredited because its traditional link to economic growth has disintegrated under the impact of falling interest rates and banking deregulation But the consistent behavior of all three aggregates is likely to impress the Fed said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc The Fed has confidence in the aggregates when theyre all sending the same signal This is going to raise some eyebrows at the Fed McCarthy said Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc added We have some very good-looking monetary aggregate data Its coming in a lot weaker than I thought The economists were quick to caution that one months data prove nothing especially because money growth previously had been so rapid M-1 in the last 52 weeks has grown at a 167 pct rate and at a 191 pct rate in the past 13 weeks Moreover some of the contraction in M-2 can probably be explained by a shift of funds from savings vehicles into the booming stock market and is thus not an indication of a slowdown in the business expansion But the data raise the tantalizing possibility for the bond markets that the slowdown in money growth is partly a reflection of a weaker economy that needs more Fed stimulus McCarthy noted that the slower money growth coincides with signs that the economy is losing momentum as the quarter progresses Some of the economic indicators are not as rosy as they were a month ago he noted He expects only five to six pct M-1 growth in March and rises in M-2 and M-3 of about four pct Slifer sees stronger growth of 10 pct in M-1 and five pct or less for M-2 and M-3 but the rates would still be moderate enough to encourage the Fed to ease policy if gross national product for the first quarter proved to be weak Youd certainly be more inclined to ease than you would in the past There was certainly nothing in the Feds latest balance sheet however to suggest a change of policy is already under way economists said Discount window borrowings were in line with expectations at 233 mln dlrs a day Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc argued that an easier Fed policy is unlikely to do much to solve Americas most urgent economic problem its massive trade deficit Because of the possibility that further dollar depreciation - and thus rising inflation - may be needed to close the trade gap Brusca said Im not prepared to be all that optimistic about the bond market

3246	This year will see a pickup in US economic growth and inflation the Shadow Open Market Committee said in its semi-annual policy statement The SOMC a group of basically monetarist private economists said that economic growth will accelerate in 1987 in response to powerful stimulative actions by the Federal Reserve The group said the Feds actions have been excessive As a result it said that inflation and ultimately another recession now loom on the horizon The SOMC said that central bank policies that rely on progressively larger swings in monetary expansion will not lead to sustainable economic growth and stable prices The group made no specific nominal forecasts of economic or inflation growth in its policy statement However the Committee at its Sunday policy-making meeting said it was basically in accord with projections by Jerry Jordan who is a member of the SOMC and economist at First Interestate Bancorp Jordan expects real GNP growth to be about one percentage point higher than in the past two years He expects consumer prices to rise about 4-12 pct this year The SOMC said in recent months rapid money growth has been a principal cause of the devaluation To avoid another costly inflation and disinflation the SOMC urged the Fed to abandon its inflationary policy and set the growth rate of the monetary base on the path toward sustained lower inflation The Fed in February said it would no longer target the narrow M-1 money supply because the link between M-1 and economic growth has been largely severed

4602	US bank reserve monetary and discount window borrowings data released by the Federal Reserve today clearly indicate that policy is on hold and may not be changed for weeks or even months economists said The Fed is keeping policy at dead center and it is not about to change policy unless something fairly dramatic occurs on the economy said John Williams of Bankers Trust Co These numbers contain no hint that a policy shift is in prospect nor do economic or financial developments argue for policy change said William Griggs of Griggs and Santow Inc Fed data released today were all in line with economists expectations and similar to the numbers of recent weeks The Fed said net discount window borrowings in the two weeks ended Wednesday averaged 191 mln dlrs up from 381 mln dlrs in the February 25 statement period but little changed from 160 mln dlrs in the period before that It said that banks net free reserves in the latest two weeks averaged 660 mln dlrs versus 675 mln dlrs previously Finally the Fed said that the M-1 money supply fell 800 mln dlrs in February with the broader M-2 measure down 16 billion dlrs and M-3 up an even three billion dlrs Analysts said that M-1 last month grew at a negative 13 pct annual rate compared with minus 07 pct for M-2 and actual positive growth of 10 pct annualized for M-3 February levels of M-2 and M-3 left the aggregates 182 and 208 billion dlrs under their respective upper growth limits set by the Fed for 1987 The annual growth target for both is 5-12 to 8-12 pct There is no M-1 target In the near term there is absolutely no reason for the Fed to ease policy even apart from the slowdown in money growth said Stephen Slifer economist at Lehman Government Securities Inc Economists generally expect a modest pickup in monetary growth in March after Februarys anemic growth rates However they stress that money growth will not be strong enough to prevent the Fed from dropping interest rates further if the economy shows evidence of weakness Commenting on Februarys decline in the key M-2 aggregate Slifer said the main cause was a 32 billion dlr drop in money market deposits at banks This number has risen three to four billion dlrs a month for a long while he said so Februarys weakness is not likely to persist Slifer expects modest M-2 and M-3 growth rates of 3-12 to four pct during March Griggs said that M-2 and M-3 in coming months should return to the five to seven pct annualized growth region and so continue to present no problem for the Fed Economists said the Fed appears to be very comfortable with its current policy stance and it is likely to wait for perhaps several more months of economic data before deciding whether or not to ease its grip on reserves Given the economys fragility in many sectors the analysts agreed that there is almost no chance that the Fed will choose to raise rather than lower interest rates when it next changes policy Discount window borrowings in the past week were about as low as the Fed can get them although Fed funds held above six pct said Williams of Bankers Trust Funds averaged 612 pct in the week to Wednesday up from 606 pct in the prior week The Fed added reserves indirectly via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements last Friday 25 billion dlrs on Monday and two billion dlrs on Wednesday On Tuesday it added reserves directly through two-day System repurchases Williams and Griggs agreed the Fed will let the funds rate be largely market-driven They said it is focusing instead on a borrowings target of around 300 mln dlrs

6156	Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawsons Budget speech was described as sound and well balanced by analysts if slightly lacking in excitement A cut in bank base lending rates is now widely expected tomorrow with most forecasts predicting a half-point fall A follow-up half-point cut is anticipated next week Worthy but boring would probably sum it up Peter Fellner UK Economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co said It was a very very prudent fiscal budget Richard Jeffrey of brokers Hoare Govett said it was a well-balanced budget within the confines of the governments philosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat Most analysts said the Budget was very sound on the fiscal side but offered nothing new on monetary policy As was widely expected Lawson split his fiscal adjustment between trimming the 198788 PSBR target to 40 billion stg from 71 billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to 27 pct The target for the narrow measure of money supply M0 was kept unchangd at two to six pct while the target for the broad Sterling M3 aggregate was dropped Both Jeffrey and Fellner said the budget clears the way for a half-point fall in UK Base rates tomorrow but the authorities are unlikely to sanction a larger cut immediately Many analysts and currency dealers have forecast a full one-point cut tomorrow The Bank of England will be loathe to take any action which it will have to reverse later Jeffrey said though he added a further half-point cut was quite possible in the near future The main worry from todays speech is the outlook for inflation given the signs of relaxed monetary policy contained in it Scrimgeour Vickers economist Richard Holt said Holt noted the rather loose inflation forecast of 40 pct at end-1987 and said the lower interest rates likely to result from the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term he said although lower mortgage interest rates on the back of falling base rates would have an offsetting impact on inflation The Budget will inspire a lot of short-term confidence but it was not a good budget for inflation he said Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more about the dangers of excessive liquidity build-up but overall was not too concerned about a revival of inflation Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the leading edge of monetary policy but said the authorities were likely to be extremely cautious on this front He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interest rates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed any signs of excessive weakness Most analysts agreed Lawson had bolstered the credibility of the Budget by adopting realistic forecasts Raising the forecast for the current account deficit from 15 to 25 billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets which are already discounting that amount Jeffrey said that the 40 billion stg PSBR target was given credibility by the favourable outturn for 198687 which is now also forecast to be 40 billion stg But analysts said the Budget speech did not give any clear-cut indication about the timing of the general election which has to be held before June 1988 Some believe it signals a poll this June noting that the benefits such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raise duties on alcohol and tobacco become available immediately But others said it kept several options open and it was not possible to deduce too much from it James Capels Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent Lawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election in that there would be no chickens coming home to roost Richard Jeffrey who favours the likelihood of a June election said it was important the Chancellor had not gone for a Budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory Nevertheless he said it was likely to result in a boost to the Conservative Partys pre-election popularity

7313	Slower than expected growth in Britains narrow M0 money supply measure in February will help spur a further cut in UK Interest rates if a surge in sterlings value requires such a move economic analysts said M0 the only targeted money supply measure left after Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson scrapped the official target for the broad sterling M3 measure in his 1987 budget speech on Tuesday fell an adjusted 34 to one pct in February On an annual basis this put M0 growth at four to 4-12 pct in the middle of the 1987 target of two to six pct The M0 data are much better than we expected said Robert Thomas economist at Greenwell Montagu Securities He and other analysts said while the better than expected M0 figures alone would not be sufficient to trigger a new interest rate cut they removed an obstacle to such a move Thomas noted the rise in M0 had been kept in check despite buoyant retail sales in February advancing an adjusted 22 pct after a fall of the same size in January Analysts said the M0 measure reflecting variations in consumer demand rather than real inflation prospects was not an adequate indicator to determine interest rates The authorities still seem to want to pretend that M0 is important  In practice it is likely to be the exchange rate and the election which call the tune Lloyds Merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle wrote in a budget comment Richard Jeffrey economist at stockbrokers Hoare Govett said in a comment It is unlikely that Lawson will respond to signals from M0 alone  Reinforcement from exchange rate trends is necessary before action is taken With the Chancellor making clear that policy manoeuvres are made in response to signals from this narrow money variable the City has been forced to take it seriously he added Noting this point Thomas said market fears at the end of last year of an M0 overshoot had now disappeared This removed a potential obstacle to a further cut in UK Base lending rates if foreign demand for sterling pushed up the pound above unofficial targets analysts said Such targets are believed to have been secretly agreed between finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada at their Paris meeting last month they added UK Base rates have been cut twice by half a point since the Paris agreement once on March 11 and again yesterday when foreign demand for sterling surged in reaction to a sharp cut in 1987 government borrowing targets contained in the budget They stand at 10 pct now and foreign exchange dealers and analysts expect them to shed another half-point in the coming week Analysts shrugged off as largely irrelevant a higher than expected increase in February sterling M3 which pushed the annual growth rate to almost 19 pct well above the previous target of 11 to 15 pct Thomas said the February figures seemed to indicate the improvement in sterling M3 growth witnessed over the past few months had been reversed but firm conclusions could only be drawn after revised data are released on March 31 Some analysts said foreign investors had long ceased to watch the sterling M3 target and Lawsons move to scrap it altogether earlier this week removed whatever was left of its credibility as a key factor in monetary policy
