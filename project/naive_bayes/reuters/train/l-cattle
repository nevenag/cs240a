5896	Livestock analysts expect renewed bull spreading in live cattle futures following yesterdays USDA 7-state cattle on feed report The USDA reported high placements in February which may weigh on back months of cattle futures Meanwhile continued strong marketings during the month will support the April contract Contracts for June delivery forward could open 25 to 50 cents lower while April will likely open about steady analysts said Cheap corn is still the main incentive for putting cattle on feed according to Smith Barney livestock analyst Tom OHare They have no place to send the grain he said Strong daily fundamentals may add to nearby support while the current discount of deferred months to the cash market may offset much of the effect of the report analysts said The cash market is strong and may overshadow the report said Robin Fuller analyst for Agri Analysis She added that even though placements came in above the average trade guess many traders had expected high placements Placements are not that negative especially since the technical correction in June and August live cattle futures since last week GH Miller analyst Jerry Gidel said He said the current marketing posture will provide added support to the nearby month Feedlot marketings have been running at a heavier than expected pace Chuck Levitt analyst for Shearson Lehman said that with the number of cattle on feed down five pct at the beginning of the year a three pct decline in marketings was expected But the report for January showed marketings at 101 pct of a year ago and in February marketings were at 100 pct Levitt noted So far we havent seen any decline in marketings They feedlot operators are marketing more cattle than they had intended for the first quarter which is a bullish development Levitt said Gidel also noted that marketings for the early part of March are running ahead of a year ago Feedlots are not falling behind and are holding that 100 pct marketing pace
6492	Most of the cattle now being placed on US feedlots weigh less than normal and likely will remain on feed longer spreading out marketings and supporting cattle prices through the summer because of reduced beef supply The prospect of so many cattle remaining on feed for a longer time blunted the market impact of the high placements reported in the USDAs latest cattle on feed report livestock analysts said After the USDA released its report of cattle on feed in seven states as of March 1 cattle futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange yesterday rose sharply The trade had expected deferred contracts to decline on the USDA report of a 15 pct rise in cattle placements in February from a year ago Although the heavy placements were expected analysts noted reports that many cattle put on feed were relatively lightweight and said feedlot operators would feed the lighter cattle into the autumn rather than market them during the summer as would be the case with the heavier cattle normally placed on feed Although reports of actual cattle weights are difficult to obtain industry sources in the West and Southwest acknowledge that lighter cattle are being put on feedlots in their areas The increase in lighter-weight cattle entering feedlots helps explain the jump in feedlot placements last month from February 1986 University of Missouri Agricultural Economist Glenn Grimes said The probabilities are high that in order to place that many cattle on feed they feedlot operators had to go to lighter-weight cattle The only statistics available are from some terminal markets which represent only a small percentage of the total cattle marketed But at those markets steers averaged 708 lbs in February compared with 718 lbs last year Grimes said Even if marketing of the lighter cattle is not delayed Grimes said beef supply likely will be reduced If the average weight is down and there is no price weakness to delay marketings the cattle would be marketed at lighter weights which could reduce the beef supply as much as three pct Bruce Ginn cattle analyst for The Helming Group formerly LBAS said the lighter cattle are being placed on feed mainly because of two factors low grain prices and higher live cattle prices Many farmers like to feed lighter weight cattle and grain supplies are large he noted Also the higher live cattle prices have been encouraging early movement of cattle from wheat pasture onto feedlots Ginn said Other analysts also noted that cattle are coming off wheat pasture sooner than normal because of poor pasture conditions Gary Chapmann a cash livestock trader for Chapmann and Graham in Sioux City Iowa said he believed the general trend is to lighter weight placements but pasture conditions in his area benefited from a dry mild winter To the south however he said the weather was wetter and some cattle are coming off pasture weighing 75 to 100 lbs less than normal after having gained only 75 lbs all winter
