2618	Momentum in th US economy may be picking up given solid across-the board increases in the February US employment report economists said US non-farm payroll employment rose 337000 in February twice what the financial markets expected This follows a 319000 gain in January revised down from a previously reported 448000 increase Even if you look at January and February together this is still a much stronger report than the consensus expectation in the market said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation Economists stressed that gains in hours worked signal much larger gains in February US production and income than previously forecast The average work week rose 02 hours to 350 hours from 348 hours in January The average manufacturing work week rose 03 hours to 412 hours the longest factory work week since November 1966 the Commerce Department said The gains in manufacturing employment point to a very large increase in industrial production of between 05 and 07 pct said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank This compares to a 04 pct  gain in January US industrial production Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Inc noted that the average wage rate increased to 887 dlrs an hour in February from 883 dlrs in January Combined with the increase in hours worked this means well get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-vis the wage and salary disbursement he said Greenbaum said that February US personal income should rise at least 05 pct after being flat in January He said the February employment gains are consistent with his firms first quarter US real gross national product growth forecast of 37 pct Economists agreed that the employment data were negative for the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economy and no easing in the Federal Reserves monetary policy But most said that the market need not fear tighter policy either This report is another reason for the Fed to not consider easing said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc It gives them more room to address the dollar situation he said If they had to nudge policy tighter they could do so but its most likely theyll sit and wait The data have not been uniform Stone added Durable goods were weak in January and now employment is strong In January US durable goods orders dropped 75 pct followed by a 40 pct drop in US factory goods orders US retail sales fell 58 pct and the US merchandise trade gap widened to 148 billion dlrs Things just arent adding up said Steve Slifer of Lehman Goverment Securities Inc Consumer spending capital spending goverment spending and net exports data show very weak first quarter GNP growth of one pct he said The employment and production data point to a big inventory build-up but thats what we thought in the fourth quarter and we only got 13 pct GNP growth Manufacturing employment gained 50000 after falling 15000 in January Economists estimated that 30000 of the gain was accounted for by striking workers in the steel and machinery industries returning to work Even so some economists said that the manufacturing gains have resulted from an improving trade outlook Jason Benderly of Goldman Sachs and Co noted that the US trade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exports grew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase in imports fell to only six pct and that it continues to improve in the first quarter Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter but evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paper products chemicals high-tech goods and capital goods show that trade is improving Benderley said The economy is moving between extremes he said Some reports are going to look bad and some good but first quarter GNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct A 287000 gain in services employment comprised the greater part of Februarys employment gain Retail services employment rose 129000 in February compared to a gain of 117000 in January previously reported at 166000 Construction employment rose a slim 2000 in February But this follows a robust 113000 gain in January revised down from a previously reported 142000 gain The US civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in February at 67 pct This means the jobless rate has stayed at 67 pct for three consecutive months the lowest reading since March 1980 the Commerce Department noted The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report Carson said This takes away the Feds flexibility to ease but theres no reason to tighten Its way too early for that

4005	US economic data this week could be the key in determining whether US interest rate futures break out of a 3-12 month trading range financial analysts said Although market expectations are for February US retail sales Thursday and industrial production Friday to show healthy gains figures within or slightly below expectations would be positive for the market the analysts said You have to be impressed with the resiliency of bonds right now said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane Treasury bond futures came under pressure today which traders linked to a persistently firm federal funds rate and a rise in oil prices However when sufficient selling interest to break below chart support in the June contract failed to materialize participants who had sold bond futures early quickly covered short positions they said Everyone is expecting strong numbers and if they come in as expected it wont be that bad for the market Sloane said Sloane said the consensus estimate for the non-auto sector of retail sales is for a rise of 06 to 07 pct Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs said a retail sales figure below market forecasts would give a boost to debt futures and she put the range for the non-auto sector of retail sales at up 08 to 12 pct Industrial production and the producer price index Friday both are expected to show increases of about 05 pct she added Retail sales will tell us whether or not we will be able to fill the gap Gibbs said referring to a chart gap in June bonds between 100-2632 and 101-332 created Friday June bonds closed at 100-432 today Also key to debt futures direction in addition to the federal funds rate is the direction of crude oil prices said Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures analyst Brian Singer A higher fed funds rate and firm oil prices precluded the market from breaking out of the trading range the last time the market approached the top of the range Singer said In order for bonds to break above the top of the range which is just below 102 in the June contract the crude oil rally needs to run its course and pull back a little bit Singer said Fed funds are already easing back down toward the six pct level The recent surge in oil prices has also been a concern to Manufacturers Hanover Futures analyst Jim Rozich but the rally may be nearing a top around 1850 dlrs per barrel he said Rozich said he is looking for the June bond contract to ease to 99-632 and find support Im not quite ready to jump on the bullish bandwagon yet The jury is still out this week Rozich said
4771	US industrial production rose 05 pct in February after a revised 01 pct increase in January the Federal Reserve Board said The Fed previously said industrial production rose 04 pct in January The Fed said the February gain was dominated by a sharp rise in motor vehicle production which boosted output of both consumer goods and business equipment Industrial production stood at 1273 pct of the 1977 average in February and was up 17 pct from a year ago the Fed said The Fed also revised the December industrial production figure to a gain of 05 pct from 03 pct originally reported Manufacturing output rose 05 pct in February after a 01 pct increase in January and included gains of 08 pct in durables and 01 pct in non-durables the Fed said Manufacturing was 24 pct above the year ago level Production of auto assemblies rose to an annual rate of 83 mln units last month from a January rate of 75 mln units Output of consumer goods rose 06 pct after falling 03 pct in January and output of consumer durables was up 21 pct in February after falling by 20 pct in January Business equipment production rose 10 pct in February reflecting more output of autos and trucks for business use and a recovery from strikes in farm equipment industries the Fed said Mining output rose 01 pct after a 16 pct increase in January but was still six pct lower than a year ago Utilities output rose 07 pct in February after a 12 pct rise in January Output of defense and space equipment was up 04 pct the same as in January and 62 pct higher than a year ago Output of construction supplies rose 02 pct in February after a 15 pct January rise Materials output increased by 02 pct last month the fourth consecutive monthly increase after declining throughout much of 1986 The recent strength in materials has been concentrated in textiles paper and chemicals the Fed said Output of home goods was up 03 pct in February and the Fed said production of items like appliances and furniture continued strong last month
4944	US February reports reflecting slim gains in industrial output and moderating inflation pressures reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to follow a stable course of monetary policy economists said If youre the Fed theres no reason to do anything said Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc There are hints that GNP is picking up On the inflation front all is well he said Money supply is well under control Its an absolutely ideal situation February US industrial production rose 05 pct slightly less than the 07 pct gain the financial markets had expected This compared with a slim 01 pct rise in Januarys production number previously reported as a 04 pct increase The February US producer price index gained only 01 pct less than a 03-04 pct expected rise This followed a 06 pct rise in the PPI in January The Fed is going to look at this positively said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation Certainly inflation is not as bad as what Volcker Fed Chairman has said lately Industrial production growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants The energy products component of PPI rose 40 pct in February after a 98 pct increase in January This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflation is behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs per barrel said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc The trend is still 35 pct in the first half of the year In 1986 declining energy prices contributed to a 25 pct decline in the PPI Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected but a sharp drop in auto prices was not Passenger car prices fell 34 pct and light truck prices dropped 13 pct Yesterday Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said that a possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in both the financial markets and the Federal Reserve The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectations today said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easier monetary policy Brusca said if import prices do not rise this could necessitate a weaker dollar The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air he said We need inflation for US producers to compete with foreign producers Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 08 pct in Februarys PPI With many electronic goods produced overseas this may show that foreign producers are not raising prices which bodes ill for US competitiveness he said If further dollar declines are needed this could diminish overseas investment in US debt Brusca added which might necessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices By contrast Slifer said imported goods prices rose 118 pct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting to a large degree a 22 pct drop in the trade-weighted real value of the dollar from February 1985 to February 1987 Slifer said import prices may rise further as manufacturers contracts put in place before the dollar dropped to current levels expire and new contracts are made that reflect a weaker dollar David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that imported manufactured goods prices rose 85 pct at an annual rate in the second half of 1986 which has contributed to rising US industrial output Its the other side of the lower dollar Wyss said Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitive and they are increasing output Wyss said that the latest data point to an average industrial production gain of 03-04 pct in the first quarter Its an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector is beginning to revive But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not convinced that the February reports portend economic gains He said much of the strength came from factors that do not point to a sustained rise in industrial output Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farm equipment industries helped account for a one pct rise in February business equipment production Utilities output rose 07 pct in February after gaining 12 pct in January but Roach said it shows mostly that more energy was produced not that manufacturing activity gained Finally he pointed out that auto production accounted for half of the industrial production gain as production of auto assemblies rose to 83 million units at an annual rate from 75 million units In the first quarter it looks like automakers are producing at an 85 mln unit annual rate but selling at roughly a seven mln unit rate Roach said The disparity between output and sales is showing up in inventories Economists pointed to sharp rise in January US business inventories as a sign that production may be outstripping demand in the first quarter of 1987 January business inventories rose 09 pct the largest gain since July 1979 when inventories rose 17 pct the Commerce Department said Business sales dropped 45 pct in January the largest monthly sales drop on record Nonetheless economists do not expect the Fed to react to month-to-month changes The Fed has been standing pat for the last seven months Ramirez said They will continue to stand pat for at least the next couple of months
