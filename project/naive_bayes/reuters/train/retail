2269	US retailers posted stronger than expected sales in February but not enough to prompt analysts to change their expectations of sluggish sales growth for the first half of 1987 My feeling is that it February borrowed some of the business we normally see later in the quarter and the real strength of general merchandise sales will be in the second half of 1987 said Bear Stearns and Co analyst Monroe Greenstein I dont think March will be as strong because Easter falls in April this year said Morgan Stanley analyst Walter Loeb Analysts generally average the sales results of March and April to account for the variation of Easters occurrence Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said sales for February rose between six and 65 pct compared to a 36 pct increase last year Analysts noted that February is considered a small transitory month between winter and spring In addition sales comparisons were boosted by an especially soft February last year which was adversely affected by severe weather Apparel sales outshone other product groups in sales according to retailers and analysts Februarys strong sales reflected a lot of fresh merchandise on the shelves and higher consumer income due to tax reductions said Greenstein of Bear Stearns Analysts expect apparel sales to remain good as sales of durable and houseware items grow softer due to the continuing high levels of consumer debt May Department Stores Co ltMAY and K Mart Corp ltKM were among the strong performers posting comparable store sales gains of 94 pct and 82 pct respectively May had an overall sales gain of 150 pct and K Mart had a 131 pct sales gain last month Favorable consumer response to our merchandise programs continued to positively impact our sales comparisons IN addition to the strong contribution by K Mart stores all our specialty retailing companies had excellent February sales said K Mart chairman Bernard Fauber Sears Roebuck and Co ltS posted a 49 pct increase Domestic sales were led by better than average increases in apparel home fashions and hardware and especially strong catalog sales said Sears chairman Edward Brennan Analysts were a little disappointed by JC Penney Co Inc ltJCP which started out with especially strong sales early in the month Penney posted a 55 pct increase on a comparitive store basis and a 53 pct gain in overall sales Penney chairman William Howell said store sales were strongest during the early part of the month while catalog demand was consistently strong throughout the period Store sales activity varied throughout the country ranging from good in the East to weak in the depressed southwest Analysts also said gross profit margins were high as retailers were not overly promotional due to leaner inventories than a year ago February is not a big month seasonally but these numbers suggest a fairly good trend for consumer spending said Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst Jeff Edelman FEBRUARY SALES FOR MAJOR US RETAILERS STORE          PCT      1987       1986 SEARS             49      18 BILL   18 BILL K MART            131     15 BILL   13 BILL WAL-MART          440     885 MLN    615 MLN JC PENNEY         53      780 MLN    741 MLN FEDERATED         96      720 MLN    657 MLN MAY               150     632 MLN    550 MLN DAYTON HUDSON     195     602 MLN    504 MLN ZAYRE             257     327 MLN    260 MLN MONTGOMERY WARD   111     277 MLN    249 MLN

2618	Momentum in th US economy may be picking up given solid across-the board increases in the February US employment report economists said US non-farm payroll employment rose 337000 in February twice what the financial markets expected This follows a 319000 gain in January revised down from a previously reported 448000 increase Even if you look at January and February together this is still a much stronger report than the consensus expectation in the market said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation Economists stressed that gains in hours worked signal much larger gains in February US production and income than previously forecast The average work week rose 02 hours to 350 hours from 348 hours in January The average manufacturing work week rose 03 hours to 412 hours the longest factory work week since November 1966 the Commerce Department said The gains in manufacturing employment point to a very large increase in industrial production of between 05 and 07 pct said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank This compares to a 04 pct  gain in January US industrial production Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Inc noted that the average wage rate increased to 887 dlrs an hour in February from 883 dlrs in January Combined with the increase in hours worked this means well get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-vis the wage and salary disbursement he said Greenbaum said that February US personal income should rise at least 05 pct after being flat in January He said the February employment gains are consistent with his firms first quarter US real gross national product growth forecast of 37 pct Economists agreed that the employment data were negative for the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economy and no easing in the Federal Reserves monetary policy But most said that the market need not fear tighter policy either This report is another reason for the Fed to not consider easing said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc It gives them more room to address the dollar situation he said If they had to nudge policy tighter they could do so but its most likely theyll sit and wait The data have not been uniform Stone added Durable goods were weak in January and now employment is strong In January US durable goods orders dropped 75 pct followed by a 40 pct drop in US factory goods orders US retail sales fell 58 pct and the US merchandise trade gap widened to 148 billion dlrs Things just arent adding up said Steve Slifer of Lehman Goverment Securities Inc Consumer spending capital spending goverment spending and net exports data show very weak first quarter GNP growth of one pct he said The employment and production data point to a big inventory build-up but thats what we thought in the fourth quarter and we only got 13 pct GNP growth Manufacturing employment gained 50000 after falling 15000 in January Economists estimated that 30000 of the gain was accounted for by striking workers in the steel and machinery industries returning to work Even so some economists said that the manufacturing gains have resulted from an improving trade outlook Jason Benderly of Goldman Sachs and Co noted that the US trade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exports grew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase in imports fell to only six pct and that it continues to improve in the first quarter Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter but evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paper products chemicals high-tech goods and capital goods show that trade is improving Benderley said The economy is moving between extremes he said Some reports are going to look bad and some good but first quarter GNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct A 287000 gain in services employment comprised the greater part of Februarys employment gain Retail services employment rose 129000 in February compared to a gain of 117000 in January previously reported at 166000 Construction employment rose a slim 2000 in February But this follows a robust 113000 gain in January revised down from a previously reported 142000 gain The US civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in February at 67 pct This means the jobless rate has stayed at 67 pct for three consecutive months the lowest reading since March 1980 the Commerce Department noted The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report Carson said This takes away the Feds flexibility to ease but theres no reason to tighten Its way too early for that
4005	US economic data this week could be the key in determining whether US interest rate futures break out of a 3-12 month trading range financial analysts said Although market expectations are for February US retail sales Thursday and industrial production Friday to show healthy gains figures within or slightly below expectations would be positive for the market the analysts said You have to be impressed with the resiliency of bonds right now said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane Treasury bond futures came under pressure today which traders linked to a persistently firm federal funds rate and a rise in oil prices However when sufficient selling interest to break below chart support in the June contract failed to materialize participants who had sold bond futures early quickly covered short positions they said Everyone is expecting strong numbers and if they come in as expected it wont be that bad for the market Sloane said Sloane said the consensus estimate for the non-auto sector of retail sales is for a rise of 06 to 07 pct Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs said a retail sales figure below market forecasts would give a boost to debt futures and she put the range for the non-auto sector of retail sales at up 08 to 12 pct Industrial production and the producer price index Friday both are expected to show increases of about 05 pct she added Retail sales will tell us whether or not we will be able to fill the gap Gibbs said referring to a chart gap in June bonds between 100-2632 and 101-332 created Friday June bonds closed at 100-432 today Also key to debt futures direction in addition to the federal funds rate is the direction of crude oil prices said Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures analyst Brian Singer A higher fed funds rate and firm oil prices precluded the market from breaking out of the trading range the last time the market approached the top of the range Singer said In order for bonds to break above the top of the range which is just below 102 in the June contract the crude oil rally needs to run its course and pull back a little bit Singer said Fed funds are already easing back down toward the six pct level The recent surge in oil prices has also been a concern to Manufacturers Hanover Futures analyst Jim Rozich but the rally may be nearing a top around 1850 dlrs per barrel he said Rozich said he is looking for the June bond contract to ease to 99-632 and find support Im not quite ready to jump on the bullish bandwagon yet The jury is still out this week Rozich said

4173	UK Retailers expect consumer spending to accelerate in March after a disappointing increase in February according to a monthly survey by the Confederation of British Industry CBI Fifty-nine pct of the 325 retailers questioned for the latest Distributive Trades Survey expected sales to be higher in March than they were in March 1986 with only six pct expecting lower sales The chairman of the Distributive Trades Survey Panel Nigel Whittaker said a favourable Budget next week would further help sales during the summer Figures released earlier this week showed retail sales in January fell 22 pct mainly due to exceptionally cold weather Sales did not recover in February as much as retailers had expected and they are now looking for better business in March todays survey said It reported clothing stores were the most optimistic with 80 pct expecting sales in March to be higher than a year ago Wholesalers also expected stronger sales in March while both retailers and wholesalers reported slower growth in import penetration it said

4290	US retail sales rose sharply in February but many economists said the underlying consumer spending trend remains weak February retail sales jumped 41 pct more than the 25-30 pct rise the financial markets had anticipated But Januarys sales were revised down to a 74 pct drop from a previously reported 58 pct decline The trend is toward continued spending but certainly at a much more sluggish pace said Don Maude of Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc Maude averaged out the wide swings in the retail sales data over past four months to show that the pace of consumer spending is slowing Combining the latest data with a 06 pct drop in November and a 46 pct gain in December the average retail sales gain over the four months was 02 pct he said compared to to a 04 pct rise for year-over-year sales through February You can see a pattern developing Maude said I wouldnt be surprised to see a fall-off in March especially since sales probably wont be boosted by auto sales as they were in February Despite the weak underlying trend economists were impressed by a robust 15 pct gain in total sales excluding autos in February This compared to a revised 04 pct decline in January previously reported as a 01 pct decline The increase in non-auto sales was broadbased with gains in durable goods as well as non-durables noted Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc It was a pretty healthy report He noted that building materials rose 18 pct in February after falling 17 pct in January General merchandise store sales gained 14 pct after a 16 pct rise in January There are signs of life in the economy McCarthy said But its jumping to conclusions to extrapolate this report into the future A 07 pct increase in disposable personal income in January which may be linked to the new tax laws probably helped boost spending in February he said A lot of people may be inadvertently under-withholding taxes from their paychecks he said When people in this country get an increase in disposable income the inclination is to go out and spend it he said Economists said tomorrows release of US auto sales for the first 10 days of March will be an important indicator of how much this sector will add to first quarter spending Auto sales accounted for the lions share of total February sales rising 144 pct This followed a 277 pct drop in January previously reported as a 224 pct fall due largely to the expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax laws January 1 the Commerce Department noted Some economists argued that the because the gain in total sales excluding autos also followed a decline in January the strength in the February report is less than impressive There is strength in the February data but thats because they were compared to low sales levels in January said said Beth Reiners of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc We dont see it as a precursor of continued strength Durable goods sales rose 88 pct in February after falling 177 pct in January February non-durable goods sales gained 13 pct after declining 02 pct in January Gasoline service station sales rose two pct in February following a 19 pct gain in January but economists said higher oil prices rather than an increased volume of gas sales probably accounted for these gains Reiners also emphasized that the trend in consumer spending is weakening Total retail sales on average were 123 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986 she said In January they fell to a seasonally adjusted 11752 bilion dlrs and in February rose to 12229 billion dlrs On average it looks like theyll total 120 to 121 mln dlrs in the first quartrer she said We dont look at this as indication that the economy is barrelling along The number is not really that problematic for those of us who are constructive on the bond market agreed Elliot Platt of Donaldsen Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp Platt does not foresee potential for tighter monetary policy on the basis of the latest retail sales report The Fed is on hold now because the data have been so confusing he said Before the 337000 gain in February non-farm payroll employment I would have looked for a discount rate cut in March he said But now Fed officials will have to wait for the first quarter real US gross national product data in April to sort things out

8746	The US economy is showing some promising signs of accelerated expansion despite the sluggishness of the fourth quarter last year private economists say Some of the slowness experienced in the October-December period had been expected to spill over into the first quarter this year as the tax law changes that went into effect in January slowed business and consumer spending But some of the latest economic data show signs of surprising strength in the US economy although some economists remain cautious about the outlook The Commerce Department reported today that new orders for durable goods in February jumped by 57 billion dlrs a six pct rise to 1012 billion dlrs Even excluding volatile defense goods durable goods orders rose a healthy 38 pct the agency said The February numbers surpassed the expectations of many financial analysts whose predictions ranged from flat to increases of up to five pct The JanuaryFebruary employment statistics suggest the Gross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth for the first three months of this year said Lyle Gramley an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association The US jobless rate in February and January was 67 pct the lowest rate since March 1980 The number of new non-farm jobs rose by 337000 in February after a 319000 gain in January and a 225000 December increase the government said The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate of about three to 325 pct in the first quarter said Gramley Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuilding their inventories and is not likely to be sustained in the second quarter Gramley said He expects a slowdown in the second quarter with smaller increases in personal consumption and government spending He also sees residential construction declining mostly for multi-family housing units Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of the fourth quarter slowness will continue Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant 15 pct rate in the first quarter of 1987 accelerate during the second quarter and show a brisk 45 pct annual rate in the third quarter The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in the US trade balance which is expected because of the decline in the dollars value over the last year and half The improvement will be gradual and long lasting Levy predicted Most of it will be through import reduction but at least one-third will be due to a rise in product exports as the prices of US goods become more attractive overseas The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit which soared to record levels last year will improve this year and the US economy will grow by a respectable 32 pct for the year compared with a 25 pct rate last year As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit the US has been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate their domestic demand for goods from the US and others US officials believe that would help take some of the pressure off the United States whose five years of economic growth has been the mainstay of developing countries The US economy provided them with a giant market for their goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed to service their foreign debt The government last week said the US economy grew at a modest 11 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalance between the volume of goods imported to the United States and those shipped abroad The report showed a rising volume of exports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the fact that in current dollar terms the US trade deficit worsened during the closing three months of 1986 While fourth quarter economic growth was weak corporate profits jumped a healthy 61 pct during the period the government said It also reported that inflation as measured by the GNP price deflator remained in check growing a moderate 07 pct in the period the lowest rise in 19 years The government also reported that consumer spending a key element of the five year economic recovery jumped 17 pct in February after falling two pct in January The Federal Reserve Board also reported that the manufacturing sector which had been one of the weaker elements of the US economy was showing signs of recovery In its latest report on current economic conditions the Fed said that economic activity in the various regions of the country ranged from uneven or steady to improving Manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in most regions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said the pick up in the US manufacturing sector is largely due to the drop in the dollars value He said he does not foresee a major pick up in economic activity but does not believe the economy will slip into recession either He said higher prices on imported products and wage cuts that have helped the manufacturing sector will squeeze consumers purchasing power That pattern is starting and will continue for a number of years Chimerine said He sees economic growth hovering around a modest two pct level for the next few years
9974	West German retailers expect another good year in 1987 even though they will not be able to repeat the sharp increase in turnover they enjoyed in 1986 the General Association of the German Retail Trade HDE said HDE President Wolfgang Hinrichs said retailers would be satisfied with a real turnover increase of between 25 pct to three pct in 1987 after last years steep 37 pct rise Hinrichs said the 1986 turnover increase had brought the first hesitant signs of improvement in earnings in the West German retail sector
