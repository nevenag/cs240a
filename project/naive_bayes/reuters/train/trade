718	Canadas decision to raise the issue of a free trade pact with the US was a sign of what many see as a new spirit of Canadian self-confidence a public policy study group said It suggests the Canada of the immediate post-war period when it was a major player in the process of building a postwar world the Washington-based Atlantic Council said US and Canadian negotiators opened talks last summer aimed at dismantling trade barriers between the two countries the worlds biggest trading partners with crossborder shipments of about 150 billion dlrs annually The councils study said the trade talks with a deadline of October for an agreement are the biggest issue in US-Canadian relations The study said liberalized trade between the two countries would improve the competitiveness of their economies in world markets and lessen trade irritants which now mar their ties The council said in the past most Canadians have shied away from the notion of a free-trade arrangement fearing to be overwhelmed economically and politically by a closer association with a country 10 times their size in population But at the same time it added Canadians realized their domestic market was too small to permit the mass production and sales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by an increasingly competitive world The council said that in the talks Canada is chiefly interested in minimizing the imposing of US duties against allegedly subsidized exports A recent example was the 15 per cent duty the US imposed on Canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were being subsidized The council said the chief US concerns included ending curbs against US banking insurance telecommunications and the so-called cultural industries - publishing broadcasting and films It said other major US-Canadian issues were defense cooperation acid rain and the US rejection of a Canadian assertion of sovereignty over waters of the Northwest Passage
843	French industry is failing to produce the goods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the economy the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said With gross domestic product likely to grow only 21 pct this year the same rate as last year unemployment could climb to 115 pct of the workforce by mid-1988 from its present 109 pct it said in an annual review of the French economy The report said the French economy was increasingly ill-adapted to demand selling goods at uncompetitive relative prices on both domestic and export markets Frances poor export performance reflects a geographical bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average AndA substantial loss of market shareIn the past 18 months it said Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit to around 29 billion dlrs this year from 24 billion in 1986 it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the franc could lead to a renewed loss of competitiveness relative not only to the United States but also to the newly industrialised countries This could result in further major losses of market share particularly in the non-OECD area which accounts for almost a quarter of French exports it said Until the competitive ability of industry improved the authorities would have little scope for macroeconomic manoeuvre even if the unemployment situation or the need to encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow more briskly it added But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage demands contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a two pct annual rate this year and early next the OECD said Written mainly in December last year the report took no account of a rise in oil prices early in 1987 and a 09 pct surge in January consumer prices caused partly by the governments deregulation of service sector tariffs We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke runaway rises and it is not absolutely certain that bet has been lost one OECD official commented OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil prices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the report indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast to around 25 or three pct The government last week revised its forecast up to between 24 and 25 pct from two pct against last years 21 pct But the OECD backed the governments view that the underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last years fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of disinflation With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in the OECD area the inflation differential between France and its main trading rival West Germany could fall to just one pct this year it said On the other hand the report noted consumer prices for industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply as companies built up their profits For the disinflationary process to continue  and price competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange rate stability it is essential that wage restraint continue it said
894	The Ministry of International Trade and Industry MITI acted to tighten restrictions on microchip exports to countries other than the US To preserve a US-Japan pact on semiconductor trade but major Japanese chipmakers doubt its usefulness A MITI spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are authorised exporters Trading houses applying for a MITI export licence will be required to show such a certificate but those without it will not automatically be denied licences he said But some industry officials predicted any government measures were likely to have limited effect as long as the world semiconductor market remained weak US Government and industry officials have complained repeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below cost to third countries despite the July agreement Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of cheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales by third-party brokers who seek to profit from the gap between low prices in Japan and higher prices based on production costs and set for Japanese makers under the agreement The MITI spokesman said If the percentage of grey market is increasing for one specific company it suggests they are distributing their products through their sales network knowing they will be exported by some means In that case we will ask them what they are doing to reduce the figure MITI earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by 10 pct in first-quarter 1987 spokesmen for the firms said But they doubt the usefulness of the latest move As long as there is a gap between prices set under the pact and market prices there will be people who want to exploit the gap to make money a Hitachi Ltd ltHITT spokesman said

1963	Poland says US Sanctions have cost its economy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washington to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown of the figure saying it takes into account a number of hypothetical losses Some of them are too sophisticated to convert into financial terms one banking source said But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Polands economy and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under-achieving They did have a bad effect yes but they only contributed to largely internal economic problems one said The US Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured Nation MFN trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under martial law The estimated cost to the Polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the Institute of National Economy an offshoot of the central planning commission According to one Western envoy an expert on Polish economic affairs it extrapolated 1979 information on growth trends in trade with the United States as well as increases in credits from Western commercial and government lenders But the calculations were based on a time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely he said dismissing the estimate as a theoretical projection based on a high point which has no real scientific evaluation A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to the US In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed Imports have suffered slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to 200 mln as credits ran out Poland has a dwindling trade surplus with the West Last year it was one billion dlrs against a targeted 16 billion official figures show Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important US Markets -- including agricultural equipment textiles chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons  Poland is accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons said one expert Its an illusion based on a misunderstanding of Western economy Theres a limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it another said adding that Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits in the 1970s which were no longer todays reality Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as nebulous one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges  Western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact on Poland which has a hard currency debt of 335 billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry MFN doesnt really mean anything only that Poland will not be treated worse than other countries It will be difficult to regain access to the US Market because different forces are in play now said one Western envoy He said Polish products were not competitive and their quality was too low Trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the US Japan and Europe would also hamper Polands efforts to regain entry Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised this fact recently Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently Making up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly difficult and in certain cases impossible In a period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about 100 mln dlrs While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation it says it has a moral right to assistance from the US Which it says imposed the sanctions illegally But a Western economist said The argument that US Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing of the Polish economy wont cut any ice The Americans will just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing Solidarity Nevertheless Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka in talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary Fund IMF and World Bank made it clear that Poland was looking for a lead from the United States He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its financial obligations to the United States but not in a short time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners He stressed that the US had a particular opportunity to play a part in the cooperative policy of Polands partners interested in the settlement of Polish debt Putting it more sharply one senior banking official blamed Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank IMF and Paris Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and said it should now play a more positive role As a major superpower the United States can influence international organisations he said citing recent meetings aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to which Western nations were prepared to cooperate

10209	The White House Economic Policy Council made a recommendation to President Reagan whether to retaliate against Japan for alleged unfair practices in semiconductor trade US officials said They would not disclose the councils recommendation but the officials said earlier it was likely the council would call for retaliation and urge that curbs be imposed on Japanese exports to the United States The officials said it might be several days before Reagan would act and his moves made public The Senate last week unanimously called on Reagan to impose penalities on Japanese exports Retaliation was also called for by the semiconductor industry and its chief trade union both hard hit by Japanese semiconductor trade In a pact last summer Japan summer agreed to stop dumping its semiconductors at less than cost in the United States and other nations and to open its own market to the US products In return the United States agreed to hold up imposing anti-dumping duties on Japanese semiconductor shipments US officials say that while Japan has stopped dumping semiconductors on the American market they have continued to dump them in third countries and that the Japanese market has remained all but closed to the US semiconductors semiconductors on the American market they have continued to dump them in third countries and that the Japanese market has remained all but closed to the US semiconductors reuter 
10255	The United States emphasis on its foreign trade deficit is misplaced and the countrys real problem lies in its large federal budget deficit the General Agreeement on Tariffs and Trade GATT said By stressing its record trade deficit of 1698 billion dlrs last year the US Was fuelling protectionist pressure which threatens the world trading system it said in an annual report The fundamental problem the size of the US Federal budget deficit could be remedied only by cutting government spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt it said GATT also predicted world trade would grow by only 25 pct in 1987 -- a full percentage point lower than in each of the previous two years GATT experts urged Washington to resist protectionism and instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current account payments deficit -- higher private savings lower investment and a smaller federal budget deficit Raising US Trade barriers would result in little or no reduction in the current account deficit It would however increase inflation and reduce world trade it said The basic cause -- some combination of insufficient domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit -- would remain the report said GATT economists said trade expansion would slow this year because of slower growth forecasts in Japan and some West European nations as they adjust production and workforces to a low dollar risk of higher US Inflation concerns over Third World debt management and looming protectionism The report also said imbalances in the current accounts of Japan West Germany and the US Had increased in 1986 The most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies it added Thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced as a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not borne out last year the report said GATT warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the US Inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly expanding money supply and low dollar Such a development could worsen the business climate by increasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates which in turn would adversely affect world trade But the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the United States despite the dollars depreciation which makes foreign products more expensive It suggested that resources idle in the US Both human and in underutilised factories were not geared to produce the goods and services sought from abroad World trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in 1986 about half of the rate of the previous year Trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade GATT said Developing countries exports declined significantly while their imports increased moderately although full statistics are not available yet GATT said The combined export earnings of 16 major indebted nations were sharply lower and only five of them Chile Colombia Philippines South Korea and Thailand had higher exports

10268	India is searching for non-communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange Wheat tobacco tea coffee jute engineering and electronic goods as well as minerals including iron ore are all on offer in return for crude oil petroleum products chemicals steel and machinery trade sources told Reuters Most of the impetus behind countertrade which began in 1984 comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading Corp STC and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp MMTC The two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian exports a commerce ministry spokeswoman said adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading One trade source said India has targetted countries that depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports However countertrade deals still make up only a small part of Indias total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 1853 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended December the sources said Countertrade accounted for just five pct of Indias 2565 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 198586 ended March against almost nothing in 198485 official figures show However the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees the sources said Total trade with the Soviet Union involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude oil is estimated at 304 billion dlrs in fiscal 198687 against three billion in 198586 Indian countertrade which is being promoted mainly to help narrow the countrys large trade deficit is still insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia Venezuela and Brazil the trade sources said The trade deficit which hit an estimated record 696 billion dlrs in 198586 is expected to decline to 56 billion in the current fiscal year But the push to include non-communist countries in countertrade is also due to other factors including the slow growth of foreign reserves a tight debt repayment schedule shrinking aid and trade protectionism businessmen said One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting countertrade deals than in the past when the deals were made discreetly because they break GATT rules As a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade GATT India cannot officially support bartering The MMTCs recent countertrade deals include iron ore exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails MMTCs recent global tenders now include a clause that preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind for goods and services sold to India a trade official said adding that the policy remains flexible We also take into account other factors such as prices at which the goods and services are offered to India the trade official said Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign companies interested in selling aircraft ships drilling rigs and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance if they bought Indian goods or services in return the trade sources said Illustrating the point the official said a South Korean firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission In return the South Koreans gave a verbal assurance to buy Indian goods worth 10 pct of the contract against the 25 pct sought by New Delhi the trade official said We selected the Korean firm because its bid was the lowest he added Countertrade is helping African countries short of foreign currency to import goods India has signed a trade protocol to buy up to 15000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from Zimbabwe in exchange for Indian goods including jute bags and cars But despite Indias new drive countertrade has some inherent problems they added It is not always easy to meet the basic requirement that the trade should always be balanced one trade source said The other problem is it is often difficult to supply or buy commodities which the other party wants Another added Barter is also restrictive We look upon it as a temporary measure to get over the current balance of payments difficulty This is why countertrade has not been made a law in India It does not even figure in the countrys foreign trade policy

10341	Japan today announced another mammoth monthly trade surplus that economists said would be sure to intensify already mounting pressure on the country for action The world has every reason to be furious with Japan for not moving more quickly Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd economist Eric Rasmussen said The Finance Ministry said today that the trade surplus soared to 814 billion dlrs in February from 57 billion in January and 477 billion a year ago The current account surplus which includes trade in services as well as goods climbed to 738 billion dlrs last month from 495 billion in January and 389 billion a year ago After being adjusted for seasonal fluctuations the figures look a bit better but not much On that basis the trade surplus declined slightly in February to 916 billion dlrs from a record 958 billion in January In the medium term we expect this modest improvement to continue but the pace of progress may be too slow to ward off further protectionism or further yen strength said William Stirling economist at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc A strong yen would make Japanese goods more expensive on world markets while making imports into the country cheaper On a seasonally adjusted basis we appear to be making some progress on getting exports down Jardines Rasmussen said But imports do not seem to be picking up much because the Japanese economy remains sluggish he said Finance Ministry officials blamed last months slower import growth on a decline in oil imports as refiners worked off stocks they had built up in January The officials took comfort from a decline in the volume of exports last month after an unexpected year-on-year increase in January This means the effects of the two-year rise of the yen against the US Dollar are finally beginning to have an impact on exports they said But economists warned that may not be soon enough for Japans trading partners

10355	Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will visit Washington next month in a bid to defuse mounting US Anger over Japanese trade policies but Western diplomats said they believed his chances of success were slim Boxed in by powerful political pressure groups and widespread opposition to his tax reform plans Nakasone will be hard-pressed to come up with anything new to tell US President Ronald Reagan and key US Congressmen they said News of the week-long visit starting April 29 coincided with news that Japan recorded a 814 billion dlr trade surplus last month more than 70 pct higher than a year earlier It also came one day after the Reagan Administrations Economic Policy Council decided to take retaliatory action against Japan for its alleged failure to live up to a joint trade agreement on computer microchips Nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages - one designed to pep up Japans sagging economy and imports in the short-term the other to redirect the country in the medium term away from its over-dependence on exports for growth But government officials said political infighting could rob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent one from seeing the light of day Nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up a package of short-term economic measures until after its 198788 budget passed parliament because he feared that would amount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate But his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for his trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan Faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the US Virtually empty-handed Nakasone today ordered his ruling Liberal Democratic Party LDP to come up with its own measures He can then tell Reagan the LDP package will form the basis of the governments plans without losing face in parliament over the budget political analysts said Officials working on the governments short-term economic package said it would probably include interest rate cuts on loans by government corporations deregulation measures to pass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in the form of lower prices and accelerated public investment They said a record portion of state investment planned for the entire 198788 fiscal year will take place in the first half probably over 80 pct Diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy Reagan who is under pressure from the Democrat-controlled US Congress to take greater action to cut the huge American trade deficit To complement the short-term measures Nakasone is also likely to present Reagan with details of Japans longer-term economic plans A high-ranking advisory body headed by former Bank of Japan governor Haruo Maekawa is expected to come up with a final report outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy days before Nakasone is scheduled to leave for Washington Its recommendations are designed as a follow-up to Maekawas report last year on economic restructuring and are likely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas as agricultural reform and land policy officials said While wanting to make the report as explicit and detailed as possible they said the political realities might force them to water down some of the committees recommendations A subcommittee is considering what the Japanese economy might look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoes massive restructuring officials said The subcommittee projects that the current account surplus will fall to less than two pct of Japans total output or gross national product around 1993 or 1995 Last year the surplus which measures trade in goods and services amounted to over four pct of gnp The subcommittee also projects annual economic growth for Japan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradual appreciation of the yen to about 130 to the dollar by around 1993 from 150 now

Secretary James Baker and one of his top aides Assistant Secretary David Mulford said last week there was no target for the dollar a statement that sent the yen soaring against the dollar despite massive central bank intervention That was no slip of the tongue said one western monetary official who asked not to be identified For now the strategy appears to be working Japanese officials said late last week a package to bolster domestic demand will be ready in early April Until last week there were few indications the package would be ready anytime soon The Reagan administration facing an uproar in Congress over the apparent lack of progress in cutting the 1698 billion dlr trade deficit is learning now that to extract results from Japan dramatic action is required Last week the White House imposed unprecedented tariffs on certain Japanese electronic goods after Tokyo failed to adhere to a semi-conductor pricing accord between the two countries The shift in US strategy in part designed to appease mounting Congressional anger over Japanese policies comes just two weeks before industrial nations reconvene here to review the Paris agreement to stabilize currencies And news that Japan earned a record 18 billion dlr trade surplus in the first two months this year just underscored the need for urgent action in the view of US officials Nonetheless US officials see signs of improvement in the deficit Id be stunned if we were not going to derive some benefits from the lower dollar soon said one In Paris leading industrial nations agreed to cooperate closely to foster currency stability within ranges reflecting underlying economic fundamentals or economic reality The agreement envisages those fundamentals to include Japan and West Germany stimulating their economies and the United States cutting its budget deficit The three nations joined by France Britain and Canada agree these policies are essential to redress huge global trade imbalances But analysts say markets have signalled the underlying fundamentals imply a lower dollar rather than a stable one Markets in effect are less confident than governments that these measures -- including US budget deficit cuts agreed by Congress and the White House --will be carried out Nonetheless the dollars sharp fall has not undermined cooperation A US economic policymaker said the accord was on track and

program is and Germany will report on its plans Maybe theres a need to move faster one source said Mulford told Congress last week the Paris accord called in effect for currency stability for several

13946	Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said that debtor nations have made much progress in laying the groundwork for economic growth but a solution to world debt difficulties was endangered by inaction on new financing There is clearly a danger that adequate financing arrangements are not being negotiated and put in place in a timely way Volcker told the Senate Banking Committee The borrowing countries need to be able to proceed with confidence that the necessary funds will be available to them he said Brazil has the potential for becoming a leading world economic power but it is in a difficult position today Volcker said He said it will take a concerted effort to regularize Brazils external payments The key prerequisite is clearly in the hands of Brazilian authorities he said Both Brazil and its creditors have a strong incentive to work together Volcker said Regarding trade imbalances Volcker said that it was critically important that markets be kept open by the industrial nations In addition the United States must reduce its budget deficit and foreign nations need to provide stimulus to their domestic economies Volcker said We need time for those actions and the earlier depreciation to work their effects he said

14199	Japan is attempting to cut back semiconductor production to forstall the 300 mln dlrs in US tariffs on Japanese electronic goods set to take effect April 17 industry analysts said The move is likely to create a sharp price rise and a possible shortage of the key computer components in the next few weeks the analysts said Prices have gone up for memory components the mainstay of the Japanese semiconductor industry analyst Drew Peck of Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette said But analysts said the price rises have been slight so far and some questioned whether Japan would be successful in forcing Japanese companies to cut production in the long run Others however were more optimistic saying evidence was already in hand that Japan has cut back prodution and halted sales to the grey market the third country brokers that sell chips at below production costs Weve seen the grey market begin to dry up for D-RAMS and it has virtually dried up for EPROMS said Merrill Lynch analyst Thomas Kurlack of the two key memory chips used in computers Prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries are stretching Kurlack added Industry analysts said Japans Ministry of International Trade and Industry or MITI had requested the cut backs in production to meet the terms of last years semiconductor accord with the US The Reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs on Japanese electronic goods alleging that Japan had failed to live up to the accord and continued to dump the computer components in the US market But some analysts said Japans attempt to mollify the US was a double edged sword and might be read at a subtle form of trade retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the US As production in Japan is cut these analysts argue prices will rise in the US and few American semiconductor manufactures will be able to take up the slack since most long ago exited the market for memory chips US computer makers that use the chips in their machines will then be pressured The Japanese are looking for ways to reduce trade pressures from Washington but at the same time theyre demonstating their muscle analyst Peck said The cut backs in Japanese production are expected to benefit US chip makers I think this could be a very important factor for US semiconductor manufacturers industry analyst Elliot Levine of Ladenburg Thalmann Co said But analyst Peck said it will take a few weeks to see whether Japan has genuinely cut production He said Japanese manufactures were likely to view MITIs request unfavorably because chip capacity was still high and production cut backs would lead to significant write-offs in plant and equipment

14739	A group of Canadian lawmakers from Ontario today asked their US counterparts to exempt Canada from the mandatory trade retaliation provisions in a major trade bill being considered by the US Congress At a meeting of the Northeast-Midwest Coalition an organization of US legislators David Cooke chairman of the Ontario Parliaments Select Committee on Economic Affairs said the exemption would help trade relations The trade legislation to be considered by the full House in late April would require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign unfair trade practices unless the trade actions would harm the US economy Currently Reagan can reject trade sanctions on any grounds Cooke a member of the Liberal party told the US congressmen I can understand the trade bill I think it has to do with concerns you have with the other parts of the world I would suggest to you that we are your best friends You do not have those concerns with Canada and you should sincerely consider exempting our country from that bill he added Canada is the United States largest trading partner with two-way trade more than 113 billion dlrs in 1985 according to the coalition But the US ran up a 23 billion dlr deficit in manufactured goods that year compared to a 14 billion dlr surplus in services trade with its neighbour
14770	Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German economic growth In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs here Poehl said It would be an extremely risky policy to aim for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit He said the United States could face a vicious circle of depreciation inflation and more depreciation if it took that route Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet US Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy accelerating tax cuts cutting interest rates and tolerating above-target money supply growth He said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to the beginning of this year but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the West German parliament But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could accept on exports from a rising mark he said Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about one-third of its gross national product so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home A further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth he said Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade had given some extra leeway But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct not the reported negative inflation rates last year and West Germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments For the time being we will have to focus our policy more on the external side and we can live with a more expansionary money supply But we must be very careful he said He said he shared some of the US Concern about Japans trade surpluses which affected European countries as well as the United States Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries saying the importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level and that further changes would damage growth he said This was a remarkable change in attitude especially on the part of our American colleagues he said But he said there was still a danger that the correction of the dollars value could overshoot
2278	Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson said that maintaining price stability was critical to achieving non-inflationary economic growth in the world and said that progress was being made It is worth reiterating that the Federal Reserves promotion of price stability is critical to the successful implementation of virtually all of the important ingredients for growth he told the Eastern Economic Association Johnson said initial progress has been made on a variety of fronts Federal Reserve monetary policy the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation the G-6 agreement and the Baker debt initiative for example all have moved us in the right direction he said G-6 is comprised of US Britain France Japan West Germany and Canada On the budget deficit Johnson said meeting precise numerical goals was less important than a continuing commitment toward slowing the growth of federal spending There was evidence deficits as a pct of Gross National Product were declining and would continue to drop he said But Johnson warned against reliance on inflow of foreign capital to finance investment and the budget deficit and keep interest rates stable This situation however cannot continue indefinitely Sooner or later progress must be made in controlling excessive federal spending he said A disinflationary monetary policy should continue to be the main objective of the Fed Johnson said He also said a more stable and sustainable alignment of exchange rates was needed for long-term growth On the trade deficit Johnson warned against quick fix solutions which he identified as excessive dollar depreciation or protectionist trade legislation What is important is that we attempt to maintain healthy returns to capital and adopt policies encouraging genuine economic growth he said Such an approach would finance the trade deficit but allow for its gradual resolution over time
2352	A reduction of the US federal budget deficit will be needed to help eliminate the nations huge trade deficit US trade representative Clayton Yeutter said Speaking to the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry Yeutter said Capital and trade flows are clearly inter-releated now Unless we get the budget deficit down we will not get the trade deficit down He did not elaborate on his views of the linkages between the two deficits Private analysts have said that the financing of large US budget deficits requires heavy capital inflows from overseas investors through purchases of US Treasury and to a lesser extent other US securities as well Well make some progress in reducing the 170 billion dlr trade deficit in 1987 but theres still a long way to go Yeutter said He said the problem must be approached on many fronts and focus most strongly on US and overseas fiscal and monetary policies to foster economic growth US competitiveness and the establishment of a level playing field for trade The US trade representative said the Federal Reserve under Chairman Paul Volcker has done its part to improve the trade situation by getting interest rates down On the fiscal side Yeutter said the budget deficit is still our biggest problem and there has not been enough progress toward reducing that deficit In the international area he said that our major trading partners could still do more to stimulate domestic growth Commenting on Japan which is running around a 80 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States Yeutter said Japan is just not doing the job on the import side Yeutter declined to comment on statements relating to the dollar made earlier today by Commerce Dept undersecretary of Economic Affairs Robert Ortner In a Washington address to an Export-Import Bank sponsored meeting Ortner said he believed the dollar at current levels was fairly priced against most European currencies but that the yen is 10 or 15 pct undervalued The market will determine the dollars proper value in the end Yeutter said However he added that if the US and other nations do not take the necessary steps to cut the US trade deficit the dollar will be the equalizer Yeutter said there is no quick fix to the trade problem and any resort to such tactics as protectionist trade legislation or trade restrictions poses real dangers He said theres relatively little that Congress can do to legislate a solution to the trade problem Protectionist legislation will only provoke retaliation by US trading partners Yeutter said There is no doubt in my mind about the willingness of our trading partners to retaliate against unfair trade legislation Yeutter said adding that policy flexibility is essential in solving international trade problems
2359	Australia accused the US of increasing protectionism on agricultural products and called for an end to Washingtons special 32-year exemption from certain GATT rules on agricultural trade Robert Arnott Australias delegate to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade GATT made the appeal at a special annual meeting which reviews the 1955 US waiver Australia today said the United States goals of reducing US barriers to agricultural trade were being contradicted by actions which in fact increased protection in trade in agriculture the Australian delegation said in a statement The United States section 22 waiver is one of the basic flaws in the GATT coverage of agriculture Arnott told the meeting Arnott said the waiver had continually been used as a justification for dubious protective measures by the US He listed a recent Dairy Export Incentive Program and steps to close the US sugar market to imports He also told Reuters the waiver allowed Washington to impose quotas on imports of farm products where it had domestic support programs This covered imports of dairy products peanuts cotton and sugar Asked to comment Michael Samuels US ambassador to the GATT told Reuters These charges have been made since the very beginning The waiver is part of domestic US agricultural policy part of our law when we joined the GATT We have agreed to put the waiver on the table during the Uruguay Round and invite other countries to do the same with their programs We can negotiate them all Samuels added Ninety-two nations are taking part in the four-year Uruguay round of talks launched in Punta del Este last September Bargaining in agricultural goods and services banking tourism insurance is included for the first time as well as manufactured goods

2521	Brazils recent announcement of a suspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign debt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views among many international economists and commodities analysts that Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987 The developing worlds most indebted nation is also its most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and soybeans and might maximize foreign exchange revenue by selling hard on world markets economists said That sounds like a reasonable strategy But there is no way they can trade their way out of this situation Aldo Roldan Vice President for International Services at Chase Econometrics said Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted world markets but also had to work to make its position on foreign exchange markets more profitable Domestic costs have increased due to inflation and exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange rates Roldan said The Chase economist also said commodities markets were depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a country like Brazil where pure commodities account for some 50 pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23 billion dlrs But he added They are always pretty aggressive and they have good foreign marketing channels Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be coffee and even without background pressure from foreign creditors the worlds largest producer was expected to hit the market this year with a vengeance Negotiations between International Coffee Organization ICO members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing each other of intransigence Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations which others wanted changed one senior coffee dealer said The dealer who declined to be named said Brazil wanted to preserve its market share At the end of the talks he said Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others would suffer Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales the dealer said If they do come into the market at this level it will go lower and you could breach a dollar ninety or eighty cents he said New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 229 cents lower Thursday at 10468 cents a lb while more distant deliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute Jorio Dauster told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of the ICO talks on export quotas Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the focus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts They will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been according to Richard Loewy analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc Loewy believes the foreign debt problem a good crop plus difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the Brazil soybean crop Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and they cant afford to store the crops he said The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time about large South American crops developing under near ideal conditions towards record yields We are going to see a very rapid decline earlier than usual this year in our US exports Loewy said Tommy Eshleman economist for the American Soybean Association ASA said this years Brazilian soybean harvest could total 18 mln tonnes versus 137 mln last year Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the vulnerability of the US crop to bad growing weather Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a reduction in the US government soybean loan rate offered to farmers who give crops as collateral Eshleman said He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the soybean loan rate which acts as an effective floor for prices by keeping supplies away from the free market Farmers can forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the loan Were getting into a period when they Brazil are starting to harvest and starting to export Eshleman said But he added it will be a while before US exports fall to below 10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel Burnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much as it can this year because of its economic situation He said the debt situation was a major consideration The Brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for storage he added Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops Melicias said it would not make a big difference On other commodity markets Brazils selling impact may be muted no matter its need to generate capital Brazil is faced with a poor 198687 sugar harvest which could limit exports to the world market analysts said The country may have oversold and be unable to honor export commitments and this plus higher domestic demand caused by consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar will give it little room to stretch exports they said Brazils other major crop cocoa is in its third year of surplus Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it fell so I dont think they can start throwing out cocoa and find many more markets for it one analyst said If they come out as aggressive sellers the market would collapse and they cant afford to do that she added
2535	Trade between Argentina and Brazil jumped 90 pct in 1986 versus 1985 Foreign Minister Dante Caputo said Speaking to reporters Caputo said the near doubling in trade showed the tangible and immediate results of a wide-ranging economic integration accord signed by the presidents of both countries last July He said trade last year totalled 13 billion dlrs versus 700 mln dlrs in 1985 The accord provided for capital goods trade between the two countries to rise to 20 billion dlrs over four years Argentine wheat exports to Brazil will increase from 1375000 tonnes in 1987 to 20 mln tonnes in 1991 the accord said

2620	Treasury Secretary James Baker said the agreement among industrial nations in Paris last month is only a start in Washingtons drive to intensify economic cooperation among leading countries In a speech to the National Newspaper Association Baker said the six steps beginning with the Plaza Agreement and culminating in the Paris Accord are only a start He added we see our role as a steward of a process in which we sit down with our industrial allies to find ways to promote more balanced international growth The Paris agreements called trade surplus countries to strengthen their growth and on the US to reduce its budget deficit Under such circumstances the countries agreed their currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals Baker also said he still sees ominous signs of pressure for protectionist trade legislation and this pressure for protectionism is coming from new areas of society But he also said he believed a coalition was forming that supported free trade
2648	US Treasury Secretary James Baker said the Japanese trade surplus would begin to decline this year He told the National Newspaper Association Youre going to see a reduction in the Japanese trade surplus -- some of it this year But he said the reduction would be due principally to the exchange rate shifts since the Plaza Agreement and these shifts would take a long time to work their way through the system

3078	A free trade pact between the United States and Canada could spur the economies of both sides substantially according to a study released by the Institute for International Economics The study by Paul Wonnacott said a successful conclusion to the free trade talks now under way could raise Canadas gross national product by more than five pct and expand US exports by about seven pct He said the pact could resolve the knotty issue of government subsidies end curbs on trade in services and investments and pave the way for new global talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade The United States and Canada - the worlds two biggest trading partners with cross border shipments of about 150 billion dlrs a year - opened free trade talks last June They are aiming for a pact by next October Wonnacott an economics professor at the Univerity of Maryland said an agreement should include - Elimination of tariffs between the two countries phased in over a five to 10-year period - Equal access to federal government procurement in the two countries replacing current Buy America and Buy Canada provisions with a Buy North America provision - Fewer restrictions in trade in services chiefly finance and transportation - A commitment not to screen foreign investments in favor domestic producers - A commission to resolve bilateral trade disputes Wonnacott said that to resolve the subsidy problem the two sides should permit export subsidies of exports of up to 20 or 25 pct without imposing coutervailing duties The limit on subsidies is now 05 pct He proposed that any attempt to impose new duties to offset subsidies should go first a special disputes commission for resolution at an early stage Wonnacott said bilateral free trade would contribute to the efficiency of the North American economies and to their competitiveness in facing overseas producers He said it would it would open US markets to Canadian goods and enable them to benefit from the economies of mass production Benefits to the United States would be fewer than those to Canada proportionately he said because of the already large US gross national product Wonnacott said also that a US-Canada pact in such areas as export subsidies and the creation of a dispute commission could set an example for the current attempt by GATT to write new and more liberal global trading regulations

3267	USX Corp chairman David Roderick called for a lower value for the US dollar against other currencies to help speed a correction in the US trade deficit which last year reached 170 billion dlrs In remarks prepared for a speech before the Economic Club of Detroit Roderick said There should be total resolve that the dollar versus other major currencies as well as the currencies of other nations having a substantial trade surplus with us must continue to decline so that the correction in our trade deficit starts on the road to recovery Roderick said the US should be understanding of the economic pain our trading partners experience as a result of a falling dollar But he added As painful as the correction may be to our trading partners it is less painful than leaving the problem uncorrected because that would lead us into an inevitable lengthy and steep world recession Roderick said between February 1985 and December 1986 the dollar fell by more than 40 pct in real terms against major industrial currencies and by 30 to 35 pct against a broader group of currencies of nearly all developing nations At the end of 1986 he said the value of foreign assets in the US exceeded the value of US assets abroad by 240 billion dlrs compared to five years ago when the US had a surplus in assets of 141 billion A company spokesman said the data were provided by economic consultants to USX The primary reason for the trade imbalance was the 70 pct rise of the dollar between 1980 and 1985 although other factors were involved Roderick said But it is wrong he said to attribute the massive trade deficit to a fundmental deterioration of US productivity or of American product quality These areas need to be improved but they are not the root cause of the trade gap problem Roderick said He urged American manufacturers to become more competitive so they can compete in global markets In the speech the USX chairman also called for changes in securities laws to curb what he called abuses by corporate raiders and speculators Among his proposals which he presented to the Senate Banking Committee in testimony last week were a requirement that raiders give 24-hour notice for every one pct of stock they acquire in a company Roderick proposed that tender offers must be made for all cash to all stockholders on equal terms and that raiders be required to have financing in place before a tender is made Further raiders should be required to make an all-cash tender offer once they acquire 10 pct of a target companys stock he said And payment of greenmail or a preferential price by a target company to buy back a raiders stake should be prohibited under the revised laws Roderick said changes were necessary to curb abuses but that he did not want laws that would hurt the financial markets or discourage fair price to all takeovers

5964	US Treasury Secretary James Baker said an agreement has been reached by members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD to control the unfair trade practice of using tied aid to promote trade He said in a statement the agreement culminates the Reagan administrations effot to negotiate a virtual end to export credit subsidies The practice of other governments using tied aid or mixed credits to promote exports has cost the United States lost jobs and lost exports the Treasury said The agreement to be implemented in two stages by July 1988 would ban tied aid credit among industrialized countries and place limits on permitted aid by developing countries It would also reduce export credits that do not involve aid and reduce credit subsidies permitted for relatively poor countries the Treasury said Baker said the agreement imposes particular sacrifices on Japan and praised Japans willingness to accept the pact as a demonstration of the Japanese governments willingness to take concrete steps to resolve important trade issues

7135	The US trade deficit with Taiwan and Korea is expected to widen this year despite some economic and currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries economists said The surpluses that Taiwan and Korea ran with the US in 1986 will get bigger This time next year the US will be screaming at those countries about their exports said Steve Cerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the US after Japan and Canada while Korea is the seventh largest Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress the Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric against Taiwan and Korea urging those countries to allow their currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade The thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized countries NICs amid signs the dollars steep drop against the currencies of Japan and most EC nations -- previously the main focus of the US drive to cut its trade gap -- is beginning to close the competiveness gap for American goods US Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that he expects a reduction in Japans trade surplus this year But US manufacturers still are losing markets on their own doorstep to Taiwan and Korea whose currencies have not risen as much as the yen and the mark As major beneficiaries of soft oil prices and with low labor costs Taiwanese and Korean exporters are well-placed to take up the slack In 1986 the fashionable comment in Washington was Japan-bashing Now its NIC-bashing said Robert Chandross of Lloyds Bank PLC Asias four main NICs -- Hong Kong South Korea Singapore and Taiwan -- accounted for almost one-fifth of the overall 170 billion dlr US merchandise trade deficit for 1986 The US trade gap with Taiwan rose to 157 billion dlrs in 1986 from 131 billion in 1985 while the bilateral trade deficit with South Korea grew to 71 billion from 48 billion And preliminary US data show that the growth trend is continuing The US trade shortfall with Taiwan was 16 billion dlrs in January up 244 pct from a year earlier The gap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs up 248 pct from a year ago Lately both nations have said they will take steps to defuse incipient trade tensions Korea said it is choosing many of the 122 items on which the US wants it to cut import tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation Still South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said last week that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its 445 billion dlr foreign debt For its part Taiwan said in January that it will cut tariffs on 1700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 and try to diversify exports But vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said last month that he still does not expect Taiwans trade surplus with the US will fall in 1987 The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textiles and electronic goods But Korea is raising its profile in the area of big-ticket manufactured goods notably cars Korea expects its auto exports -- mostly for North America -- to balloon to 675000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985 The NICs exports are almost all manufactured goods When their exports rise it hits the heart of the US manufacturing base It cuts directly to us and to our customers said Bob Wendt manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp The US takes 90 pct of Koreas computer products exports 72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of its telecommunications equipment A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan and South Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the US While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with the US these are offset by their deficits with other countries But Taiwan and to a lesser extent South Korea stand in marked contrast Both of these nations have moved rapidly into large bilateral surplus with the US and major overrall trade and current account surpluses the Morgan study says Morgan expects Taiwans overall trade surplus to grow to 185 billion dlrs in 1987 from 152 billion last year and Koreas to increase to 65 billion dlrs from 35 billion Concern about the NICs is not confined to the US A lot of Korea and Taiwans exports to the US have been at Japans expense said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp Februarys Paris meeting of six major industrial powers exorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies But this two-pronged approach has drawn little response from the two nations so far and in any case will only work with a sizeable lag economists say The US has not said how much it thinks the Taiwans and Koreas currencies should climb The Taiwan dollar which is pegged to the US dollar has risen about 15 pct since September 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat against the US unit and the won has lost seven pct economists say Weve not seen any lessening of competition from those countries that we can attribute to currency changes said Bethlehem Steels Wendt And so far US pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use their hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect Moreover it is uncertain how far US protectionism will get given the administrations free-trade stance Its hard to see that anything will be passed much before year-end And then the question is will it have teeth

7375	Beryl Sprinkel chairman of the presidents council of economic advisors said stronger domestic demand growth in Japan and Western Europe is needed to help stimulate US exports without having to rely on futher dollar declines Stronger domestic demand growth in the major foreign industrial countries is needed to engender the much needed expansion of US export markets without having to rely on further dollar depreciation he told the Futures Industry Association Sprinkel said the recent recovery of domestic demand in Japan and Europe has been one of the weakest in the post-war period Stronger domestic demand growth in the major industrial countries would help give balance to the current world recovery he said Asked if Japan was not living up to commitments made last month to trading partners he said recent figures showed Japans economy grew by about 05 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 Not enough to sustain employment growth However Sprinkel said Japan had not reneged on its pledges and was moving toward more stimulative policies including tax reform I suspect there will be further moves he said Sprinkel repeated his call for further cuts in US government spending and for resistance to tax increases Reducing the federal government budget deficit by expenditure restraint is needed to preserve the low marginal tax rates achieved by tax reform he said adding that a vote to increase to government expenditures is a vote against tax reform Sprinkel said the fall of the dollar had substantially restored US cost competitiveness and that the deterioration of the US trade balance appeared to have abated However he said that sole reliance on dollar depreciation to reduce our trade deficit is not desirable as it risks inflation in the United States and recession abroad I am confident that further improvements in our trade performance will contribute significantly to growth in 1987 he said Improvements in the US trade balance he said will come about largely from a swing in manufactures trade and present serious adjustment problems for US trading partners Western Europe where manufactures output and employment have been weak promises to be especially hard hit by the improvement in the US trade balance Sprinkel said He defended flexible exchange rates saying wide swings in rates were not a fault of the system but of the undesirable policies that produced them
7477	Sir Roy Denman Head of the EC Delegation in Washington said pending US trade legislation is a misguided attempt to deal with the nations trade deficit and will spark retaliation if passed in its present form To think that you can deal with a trade deficit by legislation is a mistake he told the Foreign Trade Association here Denman told reporters that possible retaliation which he warned of in a letter to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski would not necessarily be on a product-for-product basis Retaliation does not have to be matched product to product Denman said He said in the case of textiles import restrictions however retaliation would be against US textile exports Certainly if restrictions were imposed on European exports of textiles to the US the Community would be likely to retaliate with restrictions on US textile exports to Europe Denman said He also took exception to US proposals to require countries with large current account surpluses with the US to cut those surpluses or face special tariffs This would conflict with international obligations throw a large wrench into the current round of trade negotiations and could easily boomerang he warned of the tariff proposals Denman also took exception to US efforts to seek reciprocity in specific trade sectors Forcing reciprocity in one sector by imposing barriers would simply lead to retaliation from the other party he said adding that overall reciprocity can only be achieved by trading off disadvantages in one sector for advantages in another

8667	Canadian Trade Minister Pat Carney said that agricultural policies should not hurt world international trade and should therefore become more price responsive over time She told delegates at the informal meeting of trade ministers that this was one of five principles Canada wanted adopted in reforming agriculture in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade GATT Secondly support for agriculture should avoid production incentives and thirdly countries should freeze and seek to reduce government aid measures that distorted world prices Carney said Carney said the fourth principle was that countries should not introduce new import barriers not mandated by existing legislation and the fifth was that these basic principles must be implemented collectively Carney later told Reuters the Canadian guidelines are basically compatible with the seven point Australian proposals announced in Davos Switzerland in January European trade sources said the conference welcomed the Canadian initiative but some delegates and not only the European Community voiced reservations about some of the principles Carney said there was a lot of political will among the ministers here to complete the Uruguay Round of GATT in under four years and that there is also a realisation that it has to be done in a balanced way The consensus view was to proceed as fast as we can on a broad front and see what areas emerge where we can get early conclusion she said However the meeting did not identify what those areas are Carney said  She said CanadaUS Bilateral trade negotiations which must be concluded at least in draft form by October are progressing well
8671	Japans economy remains sluggish but is beginning to show signs it may bottom out soon the Economic Planning Agency said in a monthly report submitted to Cabinet ministers But a bottoming out of the economy depends largely on the yens exchange rate trend in the immediate future Agency officials said The officials told reporters industrial production down 05 pct in January from December is likely to turn positive in February and to rise thereafter raising hopes for a brighter economic outlook The Agency predicted industrial production will grow 25 pct in the current JanuaryMarch quarter after falling 07 pct in the previous quarter A rise of this size would be the largest since the fourth quarter of 1984 when industrial output rose 27 pct the officials said They also said an expected upturn in exports would be a mixed blessing as it would contribute to economic growth but would increase the chance of trade friction Japanese exports contracted five pct in February from January but are likely to grow from March if the yen stabilizes around current levels the officials said They predicted exports will increase by 23 pct in the JanuaryMarch quarter from the OctoberDecember quarter But the problem is imports are not expanding said one official Imports fell by 94 pct in February from January
8676	US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he was unsure whether some of the trade issues straining US-Japanese relations would be resolved before the two countries open trade talks in late April We are having high level discussions on them the issues within the United StatesThe relationship on some of those is very strained between us Japan at the moment and we need to relieve those strains at the earliest possible date he said I am not sure we can wait until late April he added Yeutter is in New Zealand for a two-day informal meeting of trade ministers who are reviewing the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs GATT He said he will meet the Japanese delegation over the next few days but declined to discuss methods of relieving the strain between the two countries Yeutter said earlier the three most contentious trade issues were semiconductors Japanese government unwillingness to allow public entities to buy US Super-computers and the barring of US Firms from the eight billion US Dlr Kansai airport project near Osaka The Japanese delegation to the GATT talks said in a statement yesterday they are making major efforts to dismantle trade barriers in their country I am convinced that they are attempting to move their policies in the right direction The question is how far and how fast Yeutter said
8692	Taiwan said it plans another round of tariff cuts possibly within a month to try to narrow its trade surplus with the US Vice Finance Minister Ronald Ho said a high-level economic committee recommended tariff cuts on 66 products requested by Washington including apples chocolates and fruit juice Ho said the cuts may come into effect by the end of next month Taiwans trade surplus with the US Widened in the first two months of this year to 235 billion dlrs from 187 billion dlrs in the same period last year

8725	A successful new GATT General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade round is needed to halt growing bilateral trade problems between major trading partners US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Yeutter in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial talks told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing because the multilateral system is inefficient That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT round he said The very existence of all these bilateral irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral solutions to some of these problems The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986 Agriculture and services were included in the negotiations for the first time The growing debt burden of Latin American and African nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to succeed he said Clearly those countries need to develop their export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and thats the basic objective of the new GATT round But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour It will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years Its a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two he said They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT round as a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making possible debt amortisation in the future he said
8746	The US economy is showing some promising signs of accelerated expansion despite the sluggishness of the fourth quarter last year private economists say Some of the slowness experienced in the October-December period had been expected to spill over into the first quarter this year as the tax law changes that went into effect in January slowed business and consumer spending But some of the latest economic data show signs of surprising strength in the US economy although some economists remain cautious about the outlook The Commerce Department reported today that new orders for durable goods in February jumped by 57 billion dlrs a six pct rise to 1012 billion dlrs Even excluding volatile defense goods durable goods orders rose a healthy 38 pct the agency said The February numbers surpassed the expectations of many financial analysts whose predictions ranged from flat to increases of up to five pct The JanuaryFebruary employment statistics suggest the Gross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth for the first three months of this year said Lyle Gramley an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association The US jobless rate in February and January was 67 pct the lowest rate since March 1980 The number of new non-farm jobs rose by 337000 in February after a 319000 gain in January and a 225000 December increase the government said The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate of about three to 325 pct in the first quarter said Gramley Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuilding their inventories and is not likely to be sustained in the second quarter Gramley said He expects a slowdown in the second quarter with smaller increases in personal consumption and government spending He also sees residential construction declining mostly for multi-family housing units Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of the fourth quarter slowness will continue Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant 15 pct rate in the first quarter of 1987 accelerate during the second quarter and show a brisk 45 pct annual rate in the third quarter The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in the US trade balance which is expected because of the decline in the dollars value over the last year and half The improvement will be gradual and long lasting Levy predicted Most of it will be through import reduction but at least one-third will be due to a rise in product exports as the prices of US goods become more attractive overseas The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit which soared to record levels last year will improve this year and the US economy will grow by a respectable 32 pct for the year compared with a 25 pct rate last year As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit the US has been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate their domestic demand for goods from the US and others US officials believe that would help take some of the pressure off the United States whose five years of economic growth has been the mainstay of developing countries The US economy provided them with a giant market for their goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed to service their foreign debt The government last week said the US economy grew at a modest 11 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalance between the volume of goods imported to the United States and those shipped abroad The report showed a rising volume of exports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the fact that in current dollar terms the US trade deficit worsened during the closing three months of 1986 While fourth quarter economic growth was weak corporate profits jumped a healthy 61 pct during the period the government said It also reported that inflation as measured by the GNP price deflator remained in check growing a moderate 07 pct in the period the lowest rise in 19 years The government also reported that consumer spending a key element of the five year economic recovery jumped 17 pct in February after falling two pct in January The Federal Reserve Board also reported that the manufacturing sector which had been one of the weaker elements of the US economy was showing signs of recovery In its latest report on current economic conditions the Fed said that economic activity in the various regions of the country ranged from uneven or steady to improving Manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in most regions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said the pick up in the US manufacturing sector is largely due to the drop in the dollars value He said he does not foresee a major pick up in economic activity but does not believe the economy will slip into recession either He said higher prices on imported products and wage cuts that have helped the manufacturing sector will squeeze consumers purchasing power That pattern is starting and will continue for a number of years Chimerine said He sees economic growth hovering around a modest two pct level for the next few years

8922	A member of the Federal Reserve Board Robert Heller said he wanted to see stronger Japanese demand for American goods What I was advocating here was more Japanese purchases of American goods Heller said in response to a question about the dollars weakness in currency markets He told a Heritage Foundation forum Id be very happy to see that In his formal remarks Heller said he supported the idea of using commodity prices as an indicator for monetary policy Asked if he would raise the issue at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting he said Even at previous meetings commodity prices were raised He added I would not expect future meetings to be different from past meetings in that respect
8982	The US House Foreign Affairs Committee voted to ease restrictions on exports that are now kept from shipment to Soviet-bloc countries but are no longer a threat to US national security The Democratic-controlled committee said the administrations export control policies which restrict shipment of thousands of products contributed to last years record 169 billion dlr US trade deficit The committee said the legislation will cut government red tape and make it easier for US companies to compete with foreign producers since many of the goods are readily available from other countries Rep Don Bonker chairman of the International Economic Policy subcommittee said the unnecessary restrictions had cost the US 17 billion dlrs in exports a year This is Congress number one opportunity to attack the trade deficit in a positive way by exporting more the Washington Democrat said The legislation would order the Commerce Department to lift controls on 40 pct of goods on the restricted export list over the next three years unless other countries agree to comparable controls Most of these are of the least sophisticated type of technology such as medical instruments It would also give the Commerce Department primary authority to decide which exports will be permitted and limit the Defense Department to an advisory role in reviewing requests to export highly-sensitive technology
9007	Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said he supported efforts to persuade newly-industrialized countries NICS to revalue currencies that are tied to the dollar in order to help the United States cut its massive trade deficit We do need to do something with those currencies or we will be substituting Japanese products for Taiwanese products or those of other nations with currencies tied to the dollar Baldrige told a House banking subcommittee The US dollar has declined in value against the Yen and European currencies but has changed very little against the currencies of some developing countries such as South Korea and Taiwan because they are linked to the value of the dollar As a result efforts to reduce the value of the dollar over the past year and a half have done little to improve the trade deficits with those countries Baldrige told a House Banking subcommittee that the Treasury Department was attempting to persuade those countries to reach agreement with the United States on exchange rates
9015	William Bywater president of the International Union of Electronic Workers called on President Reagan to retaliate against Japan for unfair practices in semiconductor trade He said in a statement a crash program was needed in the semiconductor industry to prevent the United States from becoming one of the worlds industrial lightweights Bywaters remarks came as the White House Economic Policy Council prepared for a Thursday meeting to decide what sanctions if any should be taken against Japan for alleged violations of a US-Japanese semiconductors agreement The pact agreed to last July called for Tokyo to end selling semiconductors at below cost and to open its home market to US goods In return Washington agreed to forego antidumping duties on Japanese semiconductors But US officials have said that while Japan has stopped dumping in the US market it has not ended third country dumping nor has it opened its market to US semiconductors Japan yesterday in an effort to ward off US action ordered a cutback in semiconductors production as a way to force prices up and end the dumping Bywater in his statement said he backed a Defense Science Board task force proposal to set up a consortium to develop new electronic products and manufacturing processes and make the US industory more competitive But he added the industry could not wait for legislation to pass and that action was required now to help the depressed electronic industry Bywater said I urge the Reagan Administration to take full and severe action immediately against Japan by invoking the retaliatory steps that are permitted under US law and GATT General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
9051	Brazilian Science and Technology Minister Renato Archer said Brazil will keep its computer market closed to foreign goods in order to give its own infant industry time to develop Every country establishes laws to protect its interests The United States closed their borders at a certain stage to some foreign goods and therefore protected its industrial development Now it is time for Brazil to do likewise Archer said at the opening of a national software conference After several meetings Brazil and the US Have made no major progress in their computer row which they have been trying to resolve for the past 18 months The Reagan administration has objected to Brazil protecting its computer industry from imports
9055	The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board Paul Volcker has written to the chairman of the House Banking Committee to raise concerns about legislative proposals scheduled for consideration Wednesday Volcker told committee chairman Fernand St Germain a proposal to deny primary dealer status to firms from countries that do not grant US firms equal access to their government debt markets might invite retaliation against US firms abroad He added even Japan against whom this proposal seems to be particularly directed has started opening its markets In his letter made available at the Treasury Volcker also said a proposal to ease debt problems of developing countries by setting up a public facility to buy their debts owed to commercial banks was a problem I believe that the prospect of debt relief would undermine the difficult internal efforts of the borrowing countries to achieve the structural reform that is needed regardless of the policies that are followed on servicing external debt Volcker said It might also cause private lenders to become reluctant to extend more credit to the borrowing countries he said Volcker said he endorsed comments by Treasury Secretary James Baker about the inappropriateness of using public resources for purchasing private commercial bank debt which we both see as an inherent aspect of the proposed international debt facility He also said a proposal for establishing formal procedures for international negotiations on currency exchange rates is unrealistic and could well have damaging effects For example the bills directive to intitiate negotiations in order to achieve a competitive exchange rate for the dollar -- a matter upon which there can be considerable difference among analysts -- runs the risk of building up potentially destabilizing market expectations Volcker said He recommended we should not lock ourselves into formalized procedures for international negotiations on exchange rates but instead use other more flexible means like the recent mmeting in Paris between US treasury and central bank representatives and those of major trade allies
