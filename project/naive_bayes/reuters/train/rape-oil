The Indian State Trading Corporation
purchased 46,000 tonnes of vegetable oils at its import tender
on Friday, market sources said.
    The business was for April shipments and comprised 20,000
tonnes of European rapeseed oil at 318 dlrs, 20,000 tonnes of
soyoil, believed South American origin, at 314, and 6,000
tonnes of Malaysian rbd palm olein at 347 dlrs, all per tonne
cif.
    Palm oil sellers were disappointed at the light purchase of
rbd olein and early trading saw the market ease nearly 10 dlrs
under Malaysian refiner and dealer selling. April shipments
traded down to 326 dlrs per tonne, fob.

The Indian State Trading Corporation
(STC) bought a 20,000 tonne cargo of optional origin rapeseed
oil at its vegetable oil import tender yesterday, traders said.
The oil was for June 20/July 20 shipment at 321 dlrs per tonne
cif.
    Traders said the STC attempted to buy eight cargoes of
processed palm oil but its price ideas were too low for
exporters. It also failed to secure soyoil for the same reason,
they said.

The Mexican Secretariat of Commerce
has told the U.S. that recent implementation of a 10 pct ad
valorem tariff for fixed vegetable oils, fluid or solid, crude,
refined or purified, was not targeted at sunflower oil, the
U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    In its World Production and Trade Report, the department
said the increase in tariffs on this category which includes
sunflower, corn and rapeseed oils, was a reaction to importers
using basket categories to avoid paying tariffs on specific
high-tariff products.
