1926	The highly visible drama involving the yens sharp rise against the US Dollar is obscuring the fact that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major European currencies thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions Japanese and European research officials said The officials looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the Group of Five G-5 industrial nations told Reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the Japan-US Trade axis into a Japan-European Community EC axis to the discomfort of Europe In many ways not least in terms of rare international cooperation the September 1985 New York Plaza pact between the US Japan West Germany Britain and France to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture in which the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance but not necessarily central significance the officials said The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took place the dollar was already on its way down The agreement simply helped it on its way Senior EC financial expert in Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely You have to look at the dollars peak compared with now and that was well before Plaza he said On February 25 1985 the dollar peaked against the yen at 26315 yen On September 20 the Friday before Plaza it was 242 Since then despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action the dollar trend has been down down down Yet the ECU is now around 1734 yen The historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story The European currencies are moving back up against the yen The close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing In 1986 Japanese imports and exports with the EC both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms five pct in yen This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus Last January Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of of sales to the US against about a third in recent years Trade with the US in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to Europe where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms which is what is important to them Suddenly instead of the US It is Europe that is laying the golden egg said de Hora The EC is worried EC business also had a remarkable year in Japanese sales but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base compared with total Japan-US Trade The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than US Firms a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance and which will cause problems This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries But therefore Japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge said Azusa Hayashi Director of the First International Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry If you want my objective view I dont expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance Last year we asked for moderation in exports and this year we may have to do so again he said

10617	A leading US Banker said the dollar was likely to fall another five to 10 pct this year and an improvement in the huge American trade deficit would be only temporary at current world exchange rate levels Kurt Viermetz Worldwide Treasurer of ltMorgan Guaranty Trust Co told Arab currency traders meeting here that the steady depreciation of the dollar had not gone far enough to rein in US Deficits on a lasting basis Speaking at the 14th annual congress of the Interarab Cambist Association Viermetz said an agreement reached last month among major industrial nations to steady the dollar around current levels left many questions unanswered I cannot see any chance for a real turnaround rise in the dollar Viermetz said I believe there is room for a further fall of five to 10 per cent in 1987 The United States West Germany Japan France Great Britain and Canada -- G-6 -- agreed in Paris in late February to stabilise major currencies around current levels The accord came after months of transatlantic argument with Tokyo and Bonn claiming Washingtons policy of talking the dollar lower had made life impossible for West German and Japanese exporters The Paris accord also brought a pause to the continued slide of the dollar engineered by a meeting in New York in September 1985 when industrial nations agreed to depress the value of the currency to help redress global trade imbalances But Viermetz said Morgan Guarantys economic models showed that with no further change in exchange rates -- and continued sluggish growth in West Germany and Japan -- the US Trade deficit would improve only temporarily He said the deficit might fall to 145 billion dlrs this year from 165 billion in 1986 and further improve to 120 billion in 1988 but by 1990 it would be back around 160 billion dlrs This is clearly unacceptable for the monetary authorities and politicians in Washington he said Viermetz said it was only natural that markets should attempt to test the credibility of the Paris accord struck when the dollar was trading at about 183 marks and 15250 yen Immediately before the historic 1985 New York agreement or Plaza Accord the dollar had been trading at 284 marks and 240 yen Viermetz said he believed major nations in Paris wanted to see the dollar hold within a loose range of 175 to 190 marks and 145 to 155 yen with any attempt to push the US Currency lower being countered by central bank intervention The dollar ended in New York yesterday at 1471525 yen --its lowest level against the Japanese currency in roughly 40 years It closed at 1816070 marks Viermetz also said he did not see the US Federal funds rate falling below six pct for fear of provoking an uncontrolled fall in the dollar But at the same time worries about the international debt crisis would mean there was little chance of a rise above 6-34 pct since this would increase loan costs to the third world The Middle East foreign exchange conference brings together more than 200 traders and bank treasury chiefs from the Arab world and Arab banks in European and US Financial centres Formal discussions which end today have also centred on the role of Arab banks in world financial markets with bankers urging them to adapt to a new global trend towards securitisation of  business Hikmat Nashashibi President of the Arab Bankers Association said Arab banks have to shake off their old mentality of commercial banking and concentrate more on investment banking

12136	The dollars recent decline despite massive central bank purchases is a forceful reminder that official intervention in the foreign exchanges can work only if it is well-timed to coincide with shifts in market fundamentals or sentiment dealers and analysts said Central banks may succeed in slowing a trend but without accompanying policy changes they stand little chance of reversing the direction of an ever-growing global market in which more than 200 billion dlrs is traded every day the sources said Timing and psychology are the key to successful intervention said Jim ONeill a financial markets economist with Marine Midland Banks Inc The importance of complementary changes in economic fundamentals was underlined yesterday when a change in interest rates boosted the dollar instantly achieving what the central banks had tried in vain to do for a week through open market intervention After Citibank raised its prime rate by a quarter-point to 7-34 pct the first change in the rate since last August the dollar started to advance and reached a high in Tokyo of 14750 yen up two yen from Tuesdays New York low By contrast monetary authorities spearheaded by the Bank of Japan are estimated to have bought as much as 10 billion dlrs in the last 10 days of March but could not prevent the dollar from skidding through 150 yen and plumbing a 40-year low Monday of 14470 yen Some experts worry the central banks have lost more than just a temporary battle to prop up the dollar The market is wary of being caught wrong-footed by a central bank foray but is no longer mesmerized Theyve lost their credibility The market feels it can take on the central banks and win said Michael Snow head of treasury operations at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York The relative failure of recent intervention stands in sharp contrast to the success that central banks scored when they joined forces to drive the dollar down following the September 22 1985 Plaza accord Then however central banks had an easy time of it because the markets and the Treasuries of the major industrial powers were agreed that the dollar needed to head lower to redress massive worldwide trade imbalances Now there is no such consensus The market is saying that the dollar must fall further because the US trade deficit is showing little sign of improvement while Japan is resisting in a bid to protect its export industries For its part the United States is apparently content to let the dollar fall gradually further and is paying little more than lip service to the February Paris agreement of the Group of Five plus Canada to foster stability dealers say Specifically they said the Feds dollar-buying intervention has been half-hearted designed more as a political gesture to Japan than to strike fear into the markets Its been pro-forma intervention said Francoise Soares-Kemp chief corporate trader at Credit Lyonnais Because of this discord and the markets momentum for a lower dollar analysts said intervention looks doomed to fail Its going to take a lot more than the central banks to hold the dollar at these levels said Snow who predicts another 10 to 15 pct depreciation There have to be structural changes that occur to make the market stop selling dollars added Buying six billion dollars in three weeks is not going to do it Late last decade during the presidency of Jimmy Carter when the dollar was last under heavy speculative attack central banks sometimes intervened to the tune of six billion dlrs in a single day but still failed to stop the dollar falling to a record low of 170 marks analysts said Snow said purchases on that scale now are unlikely I dont think anybody has the stomach for it because they saw the futility of it in the seventies Indeed because the market has grown in leaps and bound since then intervention on an even greater scale would probably be needed to impress the market Trading volume in London New York and Tokyo alone last year averaged nearly 188 billion dlrs a day according to a joint central bank study about double the previous estimate made just two years earlier by the Group of Thirty private research group There are signs that central banks too realize the futility of swimming against the tide Bank of Japan sources told Reuters in Tokyo earlier this week that they believed the limits of currency market intervention are perhaps being reached and that other methods for bolstering the dollar such as invoking currency swap agreements with other central banks are being considered In this era of financial liberalization its almost impossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan one senior official in Tokyo said

12337	After an already steep fall in the past week US interest rate futures may be in for further declines in the near term financial analysts said However some analysts said recent sharp losses in bond futures have left the bond market somewhat oversold and the contracts on long-term debt could stage a recovery before resuming their decline Key to the near-term direction of futures will be the course of the dollar they said As the dollar goes so goes the bond market said Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs The recent decline in the dollar which hit a 40-year low against the Japanese yen Monday was reversed Wednesday when several large US money center banks unexpectedly raised their prime lending rates by a quarter point to 7-34 pct Even though the prime rate cut was good for the dollar foreign exchange traders are not convinced the dollar decline is over Gibbs said The dollar decline was key in recent weakness in debt futures as it rekindled concern about a pickup in inflation Indeed the falling dollar may have been a key topic at the meeting of the Federal Reserves policy making arm the Federal Open Market Committee this week analysts said To the Fed the combination of a falling dollar a steepening yield curve and rising commodity prices look suspiciously like the traces of expectations of accelerating inflation said Denis Karnosky analyst at Carroll McEntee and McGinley Inc Such expectations could mean that a shift in policy toward restriction of bank reserves is likely to get very serious consideration at the FOMC meeting he said Any such restriction of reserves will not be a highly visible form of monetary tightening Karnosky said Rather the key to detecting a change will be found in seasonal and adjustment borrowing at the discount window he said Borrowings have held near a weekly average of 300 mln dlrs over the past several months he said In the meantime however the market looks a bit oversold said Jim Wysoglad analyst at Golden Gate Futures Wysoglad said a recovery from the oversold condition could drive June bonds to a high near 99 before falling back to test chart support near the recent low of 97-1332 Technician Leslie Keefe of Technical Data Corp of Boston said that the key test for June bonds will be whether the nearby contract holds above chart support at 96-2432 All previous selloffs since mid-November have stopped and buyers have surfaced at that level Keefe said If that level is broken and the dollar continues to decline Keefe said she expects the June bond contract to decline to test support between 92 and 93 the primary uptrend line dating back to 1984

13903	Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said a further large drop in the value of the dollar could be counterproductive for world economic growth Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee Volcker said that Europe and Japan were slowing exports and that growth in those countries was also decreasing In that kind of situation further sizeable depreciation of the dollar could well be counterproductive he said Domestic expansion in foreign industrial countries has not been enough to offset the effects of slower exports Volcker said On the value of the dollar Volcker said he could not say whether it should be higher or lower to restore balance in trade What we do know is that a substantial exchange rate adjustment has already been made he said That adjustment should be large enough in a context of a growing world economy and fiscal restraint in the United States to support the widespread expectations of a narrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead he said Volcker said US exports were now growing substantially while import growth should slow Volcker said that to improve the trade deficit with a minimum of inflationary pressure the United States would have to slow its spending growth It would also have to achieve a better balance between investment and domestic savings if it wants to be able to dispense with foreign capital The constructive way to work in the needed direction would be to reduce our budget deficit year by year paving the way for improvements in our trade accounts he said Relying on depreciation of the dollar alone would risk renewed inflation he said

14767	News of an agreement among G-5 and G-7 finance ministers meeting in Washington this week will be key to the direction of currency futures at the International Monetary Market but any such agreement will need to go beyond the Paris accord to stem the recent rise in futures financial analysts said If they the finance ministers give the market something really new to look at -- that is some package that goes beyond the Paris agreement -- you could have a real boost in the dollar said Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Anne Mills On the other hand anything neutral would tend to be bearish for the dollar Mills said Traders and analysts agree a simple reaffirmation of the Paris accord will not be enough to halt the decline in the dollar nor will central bank intervention A lot of people are looking for a reason to buy currencies and sell the dollar said one trader for a large retail firm on the floor of the IMM If there is no concrete resolution they will be looking to sell the dollar possibly down to the 180 mark level he said Technically most currency futures are poised for another rise said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane Sloane noted that June yen futures set a new contract high on Tuesday and closed at its best level ever while June sterling set a new contract high on Monday Everything seems to be coming to a head right now and you dont need much to get things rolling Sloane said In particular the June Canadian dollar for which Sloane recently put out a buy recommendation has hovered in a range between 07600 and 07660 in recent weeks forming a triangle on the charts from which it may soon break out on the upside A close above the contract high of 07665 would signal a breakout Sloane said and would likely mean the nearby Canadian dollar contract would extend its advance to near the 07800 level June Canadian dollar closed at 07656 Tuesday Mills noted however that interest rate differentials between Canadian securities and US securities have narrowed dramatically recently with yields on 10-year Canadian bonds only about 80 basis points above US 10-year notes What has helped the Canadian currency she noted is an increasing proportion of foreign funds flowing into the Canadian equity market particularly from Japanese investors Other analysts however said currency futures may be near the top of their long-term rally Something will be done at the G-5 and G-7 meeting to calm people said David Horner of Merrill Lynch Economics The Paris accord has pretty much fixed where major European currencies will trade Horner said But sterling futures may still make another run for new highs up to 16300 to 16500 dlr in the June contract on the positive atmosphere that will prevail before British elections and possibly another interest rate cut Horner said The June British pound closed at 16080 on Tuesday Horner said that new boundaries for the trading range of the yen are likely to come out of the G-5 and G-7 meetings The most likely range will be a bottom for the dollar between 140 to 142 yen per dollar and a top near 150 to 152 yen Horner said In yen futures the bottom of the dollars range would be equivalent to 0007100 to 0007150 in the June contract June yen closed at 0006913 on Tuesday If such a range does emerge from the meetings we will have one more rally in the yen Horner said
14770	Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German economic growth In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs here Poehl said It would be an extremely risky policy to aim for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit He said the United States could face a vicious circle of depreciation inflation and more depreciation if it took that route Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet US Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy accelerating tax cuts cutting interest rates and tolerating above-target money supply growth He said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to the beginning of this year but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the West German parliament But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could accept on exports from a rising mark he said Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about one-third of its gross national product so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home A further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth he said Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade had given some extra leeway But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct not the reported negative inflation rates last year and West Germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments For the time being we will have to focus our policy more on the external side and we can live with a more expansionary money supply But we must be very careful he said He said he shared some of the US Concern about Japans trade surpluses which affected European countries as well as the United States Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries saying the importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level and that further changes would damage growth he said This was a remarkable change in attitude especially on the part of our American colleagues he said But he said there was still a danger that the correction of the dollars value could overshoot

2354	The highly visible drama involving the yens sharp rise against the US Dollar is obscuring the fact that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major European currencies thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions Japanese and European research officials said The officials looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the Group of Five G-5 industrial nations told Reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the Japan-US Trade axis into a Japan-European Community EC axis to the discomfort of Europe In many ways not least in terms of rare international cooperation the September 1985 New York Plaza pact between the US Japan West Germany Britain and France to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture in which the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance but not necessarily central significance the officials said The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took place the dollar was already on its way down The agreement simply helped it on its way Senior EC financial expert in Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely You have to look at the dollars peak compared with now and that was well before Plaza he said On February 25 1985 the dollar peaked against the yen at 26315 yen On September 20 the Friday before Plaza it was 242 Since then despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action the dollar trend has been down down down Yet the ECU is now around 1734 yen The historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story The European currencies are moving back up against the yen The close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing In 1986 Japanese imports and exports with the EC both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms five pct in yen This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus Last January Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of of sales to the US against about a third in recent years Trade with the US in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to Europe where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms which is what is important to them Suddenly instead of the US It is Europe that is laying the golden egg said de Hora The EC is worried EC business also had a remarkable year in Japanese sales but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base compared with total Japan-US Trade The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than US Firms a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance and which will cause problems This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries But therefore Japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge said Azusa Hayashi Director of the First International Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry If you want my objective view I dont expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance Last year we asked for moderation in exports and this year we may have to do so again he said

3267	USX Corp chairman David Roderick called for a lower value for the US dollar against other currencies to help speed a correction in the US trade deficit which last year reached 170 billion dlrs In remarks prepared for a speech before the Economic Club of Detroit Roderick said There should be total resolve that the dollar versus other major currencies as well as the currencies of other nations having a substantial trade surplus with us must continue to decline so that the correction in our trade deficit starts on the road to recovery Roderick said the US should be understanding of the economic pain our trading partners experience as a result of a falling dollar But he added As painful as the correction may be to our trading partners it is less painful than leaving the problem uncorrected because that would lead us into an inevitable lengthy and steep world recession Roderick said between February 1985 and December 1986 the dollar fell by more than 40 pct in real terms against major industrial currencies and by 30 to 35 pct against a broader group of currencies of nearly all developing nations At the end of 1986 he said the value of foreign assets in the US exceeded the value of US assets abroad by 240 billion dlrs compared to five years ago when the US had a surplus in assets of 141 billion A company spokesman said the data were provided by economic consultants to USX The primary reason for the trade imbalance was the 70 pct rise of the dollar between 1980 and 1985 although other factors were involved Roderick said But it is wrong he said to attribute the massive trade deficit to a fundmental deterioration of US productivity or of American product quality These areas need to be improved but they are not the root cause of the trade gap problem Roderick said He urged American manufacturers to become more competitive so they can compete in global markets In the speech the USX chairman also called for changes in securities laws to curb what he called abuses by corporate raiders and speculators Among his proposals which he presented to the Senate Banking Committee in testimony last week were a requirement that raiders give 24-hour notice for every one pct of stock they acquire in a company Roderick proposed that tender offers must be made for all cash to all stockholders on equal terms and that raiders be required to have financing in place before a tender is made Further raiders should be required to make an all-cash tender offer once they acquire 10 pct of a target companys stock he said And payment of greenmail or a preferential price by a target company to buy back a raiders stake should be prohibited under the revised laws Roderick said changes were necessary to curb abuses but that he did not want laws that would hurt the financial markets or discourage fair price to all takeovers
3338	The dollar will decline over the next two to three years but this is unlikely to result in a complete reduction of the US current account deficit said Anthony Solomon chairman of SG Warburg USA Inc and former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York In a presentation to the Japan Society Solomon said without elaboration that he expects a significant decline in the dollar within the next three years The dollar will fall more but the current account deficit will stop being reduced when it reaches its structural core he said Solomon described the structural core as about one-half of the current 150 billion dlr annual deficit He cited several factors which will prevent an elimination of the deficit For one thing it is unlikely that there will be any new investment in those manufacturing industries that shrank when the dollar was at uncompetitive levels he said In addition he said that the US has an increased propensity to import in order to satisify consumer tastes Solomon forecast inflation at 45 pct by year-end but said it could be kept below five pct in the medium-term if oil prices are stable and commodity values remain low
3421	US authorities intervened in the foreign exchange market to support the dollar on one occasion during the period between the start of November 1986 and the end of January the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in a report The Feds quarterly review of foreign exchange operations said that the US bought 50 mln dlrs through the sale of yen on January 28 This operation was coordinated with the Japanese monetary authorities and was funded equally by the Fed and the US Treasury The Feds intervention was on the morning after president Reagans State of the Union message and was in a manner consistent with the joint statement made by US Treasury secretary James Baker and Japanese finance minister Kiichi Miyazawa after their January 21 consultations At that meeting the two reaffirmed their willingness to cooperate on exchange rate issues The Feds report did not say at what level the intervention occurred But on January 28 the dollar closed at 1515060 yen after dipping as low as 15040 yen earlier in the session It had closed at 1510515 yen the previous day The dollar had plumbed a post-World War II low of 14998 yen on January 19 and reached a seven-year low of 17675 marks on January 28 It ended that day at 1782030 marks The Fed noted that after trading steadily throughout November and the first half of December the dollar moved sharply lower until the end of January It closed the three-month review period down more than 11 pct against the mark and most other Continental currencies and seven pct lower against the yen and sterling It had fallen four pct against the Canadian dollar During the final days of January pressure on the dollar subsided Reports of the US-Japanese intervention operation and talk of an upcoming meeting of the major industrial countries encouraged expectations for broader cooperation on exchange rate and economic policy matters the Fed said Moreover doubts had developed about the course of US interest rates The dollars swift fall had raised questions about whether the Fed would let short-term rates ease Thus the dollar firmed to close the period at 18320 marks and 15370 yen According to the Feds trade-weighted index it had declined nine pct since the beginning of the period The dollar had risen as high as 208 marks and 165 yen in early November The Fed last intervened in the foreign exchange market on November 7 1985 when it bought a total of 1022 mln dlrs worth of marks and yen The Feds action followed the September 1985 Plaza agreement between the five major industrial nations under which they agreed to promote an orderly decline of the dollar
4616	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a press conference he thinks exchange rates will remain stable due to the currency accord reached in Paris last month by six major industrialised nations but he did not say for how long The dollar has hovered around 153 yen since the six agreed to cooperate to bring about currency stability Asked to comment on remarks by some US Officials calling for a further decline of the dollar Miyazawa said only the US President and the US Treasury Secretary can make official statements about exchange rates
4882	US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said that whether the exchange rate of the dollar would fall or rise in the coming decade would depend on nations financial monetary and tax policies But he said in a speech and remarks to the Heritage Foundation that in the end the marketplace will ultimately rule the day Asked about the future of the dollar he said that whether or not it would rise or fall depended on economic policies and coooperation among trading nations Yeutter said if nations do the right kinds of things in financial monetary and tax policies then a lesser burden of adjustment is placed on exchange rates and one could envision a situation of the major trading nations moving back far closer to what most of us would consider equilibrium and exchange rates becoming relatively stable But he said on the other hand that if nations did not exhibit greater self discipline and international cooperation It is simply inevitable that the exchange rates will make that adjustment
5290	Leading industrial nations will meet again next month to review their accord on currency stability but US Officials said financial markets are convinced for now the countries will live up to commitments to speed up economic growth The narrow currency movements of recent weeks strongly suggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed the normally unruly financial markets and next months talks seem likely to build on that stability A Reagan administration official said the Paris agreement last month was the main reason markets were calm But he said in an interview that financial markets also understood That all six countries concluded that the measures to be taken over a period of time in the future should foster stability of exchange rates around current levels That is in fact what has happened since Paris Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by the decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet and cease to quarrel over short-term policy objectives Instead they have focused on medium-term policy goals but left room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings The official refused to comment however on whether the agreement included a secret pact to consider further coordinated interest rate cuts -- a measure industrial nations have taken jointly several times in the past year On February 22 the United States Japan West Germany France Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies were within ranges broadly reflecting underlying economic conditions given commitments by Washington to cut its budget deficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth The shake-up would strengthen the US Position in future international talks I think these changes will strengthen the Presidents hand politically and the stronger he is politically the better off we are with the Congress and the better off we are in international fora said the official an Administration economic policymaker So it would be beneficial to the continued conduct of our initiatives But the official also said the Administration would resist calls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a target Europeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability Currency analysts believe the Paris agreement set secret short-term target ranges for their currencies with a specific agreement to defend those bands with intervention According to market sources the ranges agreed were 160 to 190 marks to the dollar and 140 to 155 yen to the dollar There is no official confirmation that specific bands  were set although the agreement used the term ranges for the first time in an international economic agreement The Paris accord stated the six would cooperate closely to foster currency stability around current levels Last week dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened to stop the dollar rising against the mark which had breached 186 to the dollar British authorities are also understood to have intervened to curb sterlings strength International monetary sources say finance ministers and central bankers who will review market performance and their own economic prospects will reassemble again in Washington just before the April 9 policymaking meeting of the International Monetary Fund The sources said Italy which refused to join the Paris pact was invited back by Treasury Secretary James Baker Since Paris there are signs West German growth is slowing while US Officials said they were giving Japan until April to show that an economic stimulus package was in the offing Signs of concern about German prospects emerged recently when Bundesbank central bank president Karl Otto Poehl told bankers he would consider cutting West German interest rates if the Fed was ready to follow suit A Reagan Administration official said this would show there had been some change in approach on the part of the central bank in Germany But he declined to comment on the prospects for action by the Fed and the Bundesbank If there is such a provision it is private and if I talked about it it would no longer be private said the official who asked not to be identified Public comments by Fed officials suggest the central bank is keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged but if the major economies continue to show sluggish growth and the US Trade deficit remains stubbornly high further coordinated action could be on the April agenda
5778	Underlying dollar sentiment is bearish and operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japan takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Paris accord foreign exchange analysts polled by Reuters said here The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of 15000 yen and to fall even below that level a senior dealer at one leading bank said The dollar has eased this week but remains stable at around 15150 yen Six major industrial countries agreed at a meeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term but a drastic fall is unlikely because of US Fears of renewed inflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of US Treasury securities needed to finance the US Deficit Dealers generally doubted whether any economic package Japan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its trade surplus significantly and said such measures would probably invite further US Steps to weaken the dollar Under the Paris accord Tokyo promised a package of measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost domestic demand increase imports and cut its trade surplus But debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed imposition of a five pct sales tax and the government has only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future the dealers said If no such steps are taken protectionist sentiment in the US Congress will grow putting greater downward pressure on the dollar they said The factors affecting the US Currency have not changed since before the Paris accord they added Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to a still-sluggish US Economic outlook the international debt crisis triggered by Brazils unilateral suspension of interest payments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the Reagan administration as a result of the IranContra arms scandal said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank There is a possibility that the dollar may decline to around 14000 yen by the end of this year said Chemical Bank Tokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi But operators find it hard to push the dollar either way for fear of possible concerted central bank intervention Dealers said there were widespread rumours that the US Federal Reserve telephoned some banks in New York to ask for quotes last Wednesday and even intervened to sell the dollar when it rose to 187 marks The Bank of England also apparently sold sterling in London when it neared 160 dlrs on Wednesday they said But other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central bank intervention saying it may stimulate the dollars decline because many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying intervention as a chance to sell dollars However First National Bank of Chicago Tokyo Branch assistant manager Hiroshi Mochizuki said The dollar will not show drastic movement at least to the end of March Other dealers said the US Seems unwilling to see any strong dollar swing until Japanese companies close their books for the fiscal year ending on March 31 because a weak dollar would give Japanese institutional investors paper losses on their foreign holdings which could make them lose interest in purchases of US Treasury securities US Monetary officials may refrain from making any comments this month to avoid influencing rates they said
6108	The dollar is near appropriate levels against European currencies and the yen and a further fall could damage confidence in the currency while endangering world economic growth a top Bundesbank official said Board member Leonhard Gleske also told a Forex Association conference current exchange rates of major currencies can be viewed as equilibrium levels in a medium-term perspective He said the recent Paris agreement on currency stabilisation and policy coordination between the Group of Five and Canada may herald an era of greater exchange rate stability The Paris agreement was not however an attempt to set up permanent target zones for exchange rates Gleske stressed adding such targets would be extremely difficult to agree and enforce on an international level At present levels the dollar can no longer be considered grossly overvalued in relation to the European currencies and the yen Gleske said He said the dollar had fallen much less against currencies of important trading nations such as Canada Korea Taiwan and Hong Kong and further falls there may still be necessary But a further dollar depreciation against major European currencies and the yen may not be the best way to restore the dollar to a fully competitive position as measured by its weighted external value he said In fact a further marked decline in the dollar rate would hold two major dangers Gleske said First in countries with large balance of payments surpluses such as Japan and West Germany it threatened to hamper economic growth and thus slow down the expansion of real income and domestic expenditure necessary to wipe out surpluses Second in the United States it could damage investors confidence in the dollar and thus reduce their willingness to finance huge fiscal and external payments deficits Gleske said Gleske also was strongly sceptical that an international system of binding target zones for currencies fluctuating in narrow bands against each other can be established Such targets threatened to cause policy conflicts both within countries and between them For instance the US Reliance on foreign capital to fund its deficits requires interest rates there be set at high levels but domestic considerations call for low ones If target zones were established this would put pressure on other countries to reduce their interest rates even more even though this may be in conflict with their own domestic situation and priorities he said Gleske added targeting the exchange rate even within a wide margin will meet with serious objections where there is a clearly perceived potential for conflict between domestic and external policy priorities Commenting on the Paris currency accord Gleske said its chances of stabilising exchange rates rested heavily on current interest rate differentials being maintained These chances seem to me to rest critically on the expectation that the current configuration of interest rates and the monetary policies behind them will assure smooth financing of current account imbalances in the months ahead Gleske said past experience of currency adjustments had learned that markets are inclined to be impatient and will thus tend to overshoot He said this would seem to be unnecessary and should be avoided if at all possible Monetary policies can help achieve this but only if markets believe that pledged changes in fiscal policies will lead to balanced international payments he said

8714	The sharp drop in the value of the dollar against the yen and the mark is the first serious test of last months Group of Five G-5 plus Canada agreement to stabilise currencies dealers and bank economists said The dollar will be pushed down until there is coordinated central bank intervention one dealer for a German bank said echoing widepread sentiment in the market But opinion was divided on whether the united front forged in Paris still exists Some dealers said there were growing signs the United States wanted the dollar to fall further Despite repeated Bank of Japan intervention the dollar plunged to a post-war low in Tokyo today It was quoted as low as 14840 yen in the Far East and dealers here said they expected the US Currency to decline further The dollar is now firmly within a broad 140 to 150 yen range Chase Bank AGs senior dealer Eckhart Hager said Others said there were technical reasons for the sharp dollar drop Window-dressing operations by some Japanese companies who were selling dollars and buying yen before the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 were undermining the US Currency Dealers said main reason for the sell-off was not technical US Treasury Secretary James Bakers comment the Paris accord did not have fixed dollar targets was seen as a renewed attempt by the US Administration to talk the dollar down Suddenly support levels which had existed for fear of central bank intervention disappeared one dealer said The Bank of Japan was believed to have bought some 15 billion dlrs and this with comments by Japanese officials indicated Tokyo was unhappy about the plunge dealers said Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita threatened central bank intervention if necessary Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said today the time had come for the six nations who agreed in Paris last month to stabilise currencies - Japan Britain Canada France the US And West Germany - to take action in line with the pact But the Bundesbank and other European central banks were not detected in the open market during the European morning Opinion here was divided on when the Bundesbank would act While some said the West German central bank would support the dollar once it fell below 180 marks others said the Bundesbank would only intervene after a fall below 175 marks or if the decline accelerated The Bundesbank last intervened on January 27 when the dollar threatened to fall below 181 marks The Japanese seem to be on their own at the moment one dealer said Others said cooperation between central banks and governments was easier said than done Some said Bakers remarks and US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutters warning that the US And Japan were on the verge of a serious trade conflict showed there was a rift Its hard to tell whether the G-6 agreement still stands a dealer said Another added If the Americans do not get what they want they will push the dollar down regardless of G-6 Citibank AG also cast doubt on the chances of success for the Paris agreement in its latest investment letter It is hard to see that Japan and Germany are willing or able to loosen fiscal policy sufficiently to offset the necessary US Fiscal contraction Citibank said It added Markets should therefore be aware that 180 marks is not the lower limit for the dollar -- a rate of 170 marks or even less is expected this year And London Broker Hoare Govett said in its March 1987 economic report We are looking for a further more gradual fall possibly to 160 marks by the end of the year But opinion about whether the Paris accord was still in force was not universal Some dealers said not too much should be read into Bakers and Yeutters comments There is no reason to believe the Paris pact has broken down a senior dealer said
8735	The Federal Reserve appears to have intervened in the US foreign exchange market to buy dollars against yen this morning currency dealers said They said the intervention occurred near the dollars early low of 14850 yen and the US currency subsequently firmed to 1490515 It closed at 1500005 on Monday Dealers were uncertain of the amount involved and whether the Feds purchases were for its own account or for a customer But there was speculation that it may have been done in conjunction with the Bank of Japan Tokyo dealers said the Japanese central bank bought dollars in Tokyo earlier today
9022	Central bank intervention in the foreign exchange markets succeeded in staunching the dollars losses today but senior dealers here believe the US currency is headed for a further retreat Although the intervention was widespread dealers perceive that the six major industrial nations have differing levels of commitment to their recent accord to stabilize currencies Moreover hard economic realities hold greater sway over the currency market than central bank intervention and these argue for a further dollar decline dealers said The market can be bigger than the central banks And economic fundamentals will always come to the fore said a dealer at one major US bank As the dollar dropped to post-World War II lows against the yen today foreign exchange traders said the Bank of Japan Federal Reserve Board and Bank of England intervened in the markets on behalf of the US currency Reports of the authorities actions helped the dollar recover to about 14945 yen in New York this afternoon from the post-war low of 14820 yen in the Far East But it still failed to regain Mondays US closing level of 1500005 yen Tokyo dealers said the Bank of Japan bought one to 15 billion dlrs in Tokyo today and may also have purchased dollars yesterday in the US via the Federal Reserve Meanwhile there were strong rumors in New York that the Fed also bought a modest amount of dollars around 14850 yen today Talk also circulated that the Bank of England purchased a small amount of dollars for yen The Feds last confirmed intervention was on January 28 when it bought 50 mln dlrs in coordination with the Bank of Japan But on March 11 the Fed also was rumored to have signalled displeasure with a dollar surge above 187 marks The authorities actions appeared to back up the February 22 Paris pact between the US Japan West Germany Britain France and Canada under which the nations agreed to cooperate to foster exchange rate stability around prevailing levels But foreign exchange dealers were not overly impressed by the authorities intervention which they said can only soften extreme moves in the market For one thing some dealers believed that the Feds purchases were done on behalf of the Bank of Japan rather than for the US central banks own account suggesting a rather watered-down American commitment to the currency accord The Bank of Englands action also was thought to be completed on behalf of the Japanese central bank reinforcing the markets view that Japan is the most resolute of the six nations in its support of the currency pact No-one doubts the Bank of Japan is serious But the other two central banks seem to be making more token gestures than anything else said Chris Bourdain of BankAmerica Corp Im not convinced the intervention was concerted said Earl Johnson of Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago Its a yen problem more than anything else Some dealers said a rising wave of trade protectionist sentiment in the US limits the extent to which the American authorities can endorse a stronger dollar against the yen The dollars break below the key 150 yen level ties the Treasurys hands behind its back The US cannot intervene on its own account because of the strength of protectionism here said Albert Soria of Swiss Bank Corp Such comments reflect the view that the currency markets are becoming increasingly politicized Despite official denials some traders still feel the US would countenance a lower dollar to help trim the nations trade deficit The majority of the 170 billion dlr merchandise trade deficit in 1986 was with Japan Indeed US Treasury secretary James Bakers comment on Sunday that the February currency pact had not established dollar targets was read by the market as a signal to sell the US currency and kicked off the latest retreat The dollar still has more room on the downside against the yen based on the frictions in trade and financial services The currency market is becoming very political said Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank Ltd Okada expects the dollar to trade between 148 and 150 yen this week but sees the chance of a drop to 140 yen by the end of April or early May Even if West Germany and Japan succeed in stimulating their economies it may not be enough to solve structural economic imbalances in the near future dealers said Even if Japan and West Germany do expand this year it wont be enough to help the trade situation much said Bourdain of BankAmerica who also expects the dollar to drop to 148 yen in the next couple of days
