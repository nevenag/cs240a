235	Indonesias agriculture sector will grow by just 10 pct in calendar 1987 against an estimated 24 pct in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or declines the US Embassy said in a report Production of Indonesias staple food rice is forecast to fall to around 263 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 2658 mln tonnes in 1986 according to the annual report on Indonesias agricultural performance The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 267 mln tonnes with a forecast 273 mln tonnes output in 1987 The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 15 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 169 mln tonnes in 1986 because of a drawdown on stocks Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane rubber and copra show little or no gain the report says The modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans palm oil and palm kernels Constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds limited fertile land insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops the report underlines The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as wereng or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties and to use lower-yielding more resistant rice types The government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee tea rubber plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 70 pct in 1987 to 145 mln tonnes from 135 mln with exports rising to an estimated 720000 tonnes from 695000 tonnes in 1986 the report says But while production of soybeans in 198788 Oct-Sept will rise to 1075 mln tonnes from 980000 in 198687 imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant The report says that imports of wheat soybeans soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last Septembers 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand The report said that Indonesias overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s It compares with 19 pct growth in 1985 and 67 pct in 1984 The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump
1590	Sen Rudy Boschwitz R-Minn said he intended to offer legislation that would allow 1987 producers of wheat feedgrains cotton and rice to receive at least 92 pct of their deficiency payments regardless of how much they planted Boschwitz told the Senate Agriculture Committee that applying the so-called 092 provision to 1987 crops was supported by the Reagan administration and would save approximately 500 mln dlrs including 266 mln dlrs in corn payments 90 mln dlrs in wheat and 30 mln dlrs in cotton The Minnesota senator said he might offer the bill on the Senate floor or in a conference committee with the House of Representatives in the event a similar bill before the House Agriculture Committee is approved by that body Boschwitz told Reuters that neither he nor the US Agriculture Department had decided whether or how deficiency payments should be guaranteed to farmers who might choose not to plant under the decoupling scheme If payments are not set in advance under decoupling market prices conceivably could rise thereby leading to diminished deficiency payments Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy D-Vt said he wanted to go to conference with the House as soon as possible on the issue but would have to study the matter further before deciding how he would vote on it

10830	Sri Lanka has appealed to 24 countries for emergency aid to help 24 mln villagers affected by the countrys worst drought in 36 years government officials said Embassies received letters over the weekend outlining aid needed for a sixth of Sri Lankas population in 13 districts The letter said the government had to step in to avert serious economic hardship and because the Social Services Ministry had already used up its entire 1987 budget provision of 23 mln rupees by distributing help to the worst hit areas The letter said 54876 mln rupees were needed for a six month period at least until the May-September Yala rice crop was harvested Over 25000 tonnes of wheat rice flour and other cereals were required it said along with supplies of sugar lentils dried or canned fish and milk In some of the most seriously affected districts the Maha October 1986-April 1987 crop had been almost completely devastated the letter said Maha paddy output was now estimated at 70 mln bushels 20 mln less than originally expected There were two scenarios for the Yala crop with a high forecast of around 40 mln bushels conditional on adequate rainfall within the next three to four weeks Should the present drought continue however production is estimated at around 20 mln bushels the letter added Total estimated paddy output for 1987 would be between 90 and 110 mln bushels or 135 to 165 mln tonnes of rice Last years output was 124 mln bushels down from 127 mln in 1985 The letter said villagers in most seriously affected districts had been deprived of any means of subsistence because subsidiary crops had also failed It said the governments current budget did not permit it to provide sustained and adequate relief to those affected Revenue has been adversely affected by depressed commodity prices and slowing of the economy Defence commitments continue to exert pressure on the expenditure side The 54876 mln cash would cover payments of 150 rupees per month for each family as well as handling transport and distribution of emergency food But such an outlay of funds by the government would not be possible without seriously impairing development projects or greatly fuelling inflation in the economy the letter said The letter said the Food Department would be able to release wheat and rice from the buffer stock to meet the immediate cereal requirements provided such stocks are replaced subsequently The Meteorological Department said the country was experiencing its worst drought since 1951 and the four-month dry spell prevailing in most of the areas would only break when the monsoon rains fell in late May The letter said some areas had been experiencing the drought since August and in the rice growing district of Kurunegala there had been no effective rainfall since June 1986

7545	Three geographically diverse droughts in Asia are being linked by some scientists to a reintensification of the complex and little-understood El Nino weather pattern ltAccu-Weather Inc a commercial weather forecasting service said Rice and wheat farmers in China wheat and sugarcane growers in Australia and tea planters in Sri Lanka all face serious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrive in time to break the droughts offical reports government officials and meteorologists said Wen Wei Po a Hong Kong daily with close Peking links said the drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinces have been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months Rice planting is threatened in eight provinces it added Rainfall in the key farming provinces of Henan and Sichuan was 70 pct below average during February the lowest figure for over 20 years the paper said The dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pct compared with last March and lowered the water levels of many rivers it added This has resulted in reduced hydro-electric power causing shortages to industry and households The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century causing many ships to run aground Wen Wei Po said Unusually high temperatures have also been reported across China media reports said The Peoples Daily said Sichuan has recorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than average since early February The New China News Agency said the average December temperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higher than last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984 Severe drought is affecting about one-third of Sri Lanka and threatens to reduce the countrys tea crop Ministry of Plantation Industries officials told Reuters In Australia concern is growing about below-average rainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along the Queensland coast and in Western Australias wheat belt local Meteorological Bureau officials said For many farmers and government officials the fear is that while the present low rainfall does not yet pose a major threat the prospect of a dry autumnwinter season when the wheat crop is in its early stages certainly does they added Concern is heightened by the memory of the 198283 drought which devastated the wheat crop and coincided with the occurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known as El Nino they said Although meteorologists are cautious about linking the Asia-Pacific regions disrupted weather patterns to any single cause El Ninos role is being closely studied they said Accu-Weather Inc which specialises in providing data for agriculture and shipping interests said each El Nino event was unique The El Nino does not always produce the same effects and the present occurrence is much less pronounced than the last major event in 198283 it said El Nino Spanish for Christ Child because it appears around Christmas is formed by the action of warm air bearing clouds and rain shifting from the Indonesian archipelago to the coast of Peru where it mingles with the cold waters associated with the Peru current and returns across the Pacific as the trade winds meteorologists said The winds strengthened by El Ninos pump effect raise the sea level off Australia and Indonesia they said When the winds drop the ocean seeking equilibrium sends a surge of warmer water back across the Pacific where it collides with the cold seas off Peru they said One effect of this heat exchange is to deflect the rain-bearing clouds away from Australia and Indonesia into the Pacific where they further disrupt other weather patterns The prospects for an end to the droughts vary Accu-Weather said China where the affected areas have received between 40 and 75 pct of normal rainfall will have to wait for the May-September rains it said The May-September rains normally provide the drought-striken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall In Australia areas of Queenslands coastal strip have received less than half the normal rainfall during the current wet season but prospects for increased rains are diminishing as the rainy season draws to an end In Sri Lanka the drought has come when rainfall should be at its maximum for the year The years secondary rains usually occur between April and June although it is not possible at this stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual
7917	There are heightened fears that El Nino may be returning to Peru with an intensity approaching the 1983 disaster which affected the weather on several continents and caused widespread damage through floods and drought the US Agriculture Departments officer in Lima said in a field report Continued heavy rains in the northern coastal area flooding of several major rivers and mud slides have led to increased concern the report dated March 17 said However it said official sources still believe that this years El Nino will have only weak to moderate intensity EL Nino is a phenomenon involving a shift in winds and waters in the pacific The USDA report said that so far the El Nino now being experienced has not had an overall negative impact on agricultural production Excessive rains in the Piura Pima cotton area may reduce yields by about 20 pct due to excessive growth too early in the crop cycle Also insect damage to crops could be more extensive where excessive moisture exists it said However the El Nino has resulted in a much improved supply of irrigation water in the major dams which will improve prospects for many crucial crops such as rice and corn and slow the decline in sugar production it said If El Nino picks up momentum Perus fishing industry could receive a setback But trade sources still believe the fish catch for industrial processing will reach 55 mln tonnes in 1987 almost 20 pct above last year the report said Water temperatures in the northern fishing areas are three to four degrees centigrade above normal but still not high enough to drive the fish to cooler southern waters it said It said there is still the outside chance that El Nino will intensify and carry on through late March April and May causing problems as crops approach harvest There appears to be no way to project the course of El Nino -- only time will tell the report said
8161	Chinas top leader Deng Xiaoping said China must not import more than 10 mln tonnes of grain Ming Pao newspaper of Hong Kong said Customs figures show that China imported 773 mln tonnes of grain in 1986 up from 597 mln in 1985 but down from a record 1615 mln in 1982 The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that grain output is one of several key issues that will influence the whole development of the economy It did not give the context of his remarks The 1987 grain production target is 405 mln up from 391 mln in 1986 The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that the situation has reached the point where pigs are not fed there is not enough grain and increases in output have slowed We should in our overall economic planning put agriculture in its proper place to reach our target of 480 mln tonnes by the year 2000 he said We must avoid the situation in recent years of importing more than 10 mln tonnes of grain The paper quoted Deng as saying that the State Council has decided to raise the price of five grains including corn and rice unchanged since 1978 but it gave no details
