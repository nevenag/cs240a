10593	The London Metal Exchanges LME decision to introduce a dollar-denominated aluminium contract with the Port of Singapore listed as a delivery point is a positive move physical traders and LME dealers said Earlier this week the LME declared that a 9970 pct minimum purity aluminium contract would commence trading on June 1 1987 alongside its long-established sterling-based 9950 pct contract This is the LMEs first dollar contract and non-European delivery point and the Board and Committee are looking at Singapore as a delivery point for other contracts Trade sources said the LMEs new contract will conform with existing industry practice where 9970 standard re-melt material priced in dollars is most commonly traded The location of a warehouse in Singapore is also a positive move by the LME given its ideal location for Australian and Japanese traders who would be able to place metal on to warrant speedily and relatively inexpensively they said Hedging during the LME ring sessions becomes much simpler with a dollar contract At present pre-market trading is almost exclusively dollar-based but currency conversions have to be done during the sterling rings they added LME ring dealers said the new contract would match more closely trade requirements and possibly alleviate some of the recent wide backwardations Very little physical business is now done in 9950 pct purity metal nearly all of which is produced in Eastern Bloc countries such as Romania The Soviet Union also produces 9950 pct but has declined as an exporter recently they said Some dealers said the new 9970 contract may suffer from liquidity problems initially as business may continue to centre on the present good ordinary brand gob contract where there are many holders of large short positions on the LME But others said the new contract would soon attract trading interest given that much 9970 metal has already been attracted to the LMEs warehouses by backwardations The LME also has a much more viable liquidity base for a new contract compared to the Comex market in New York where high grade aluminium futures are not particularly active they said Thus it seems likely that the sterling contract will eventually lose trading interest and volumes will decline Like standard zinc which was superseded by a high grade contract gob aluminium will probably be replaced although the process in this case may take longer they added Forming a new contract and establishing a Singapore warehouse are constructive moves by the LME but backwardations which make physical trading difficult would not totally disappear as a result the trade sources said These premiums for prompt metal have become a semi-permanent feature over the last year due to increased business and volatility in traded options and are presently around 50 stg Increasingly large granting of option positions has been taking place When some of these are declared and exercised at the end of the relevant month physical tightness and squeezes around these dates are commonplace they said Listing Singapore as a delivery point allows Far Eastern operators to deliver aluminium into a LME warehouse instead of having to cover But tightness and backwardations are seen continuing even though the LMEs new option contracts widen the gap between the declaration and prompt dates These will be due on the first and third Wednesday of the month whereas at present most fall on the 20th and 25th Backwardations will remain while operators continue to grant options where potential tonnage to be delivered exceeds aluminium stock levels an LME option trader said

11273	Aluminium capacity expansion planned for the period after 1990 will be insufficient to supply any acceleration in demand growth let alone an increase on the scale which seems likely according to analyst Anthony Bird Associates 1987 Aluminium Review By 1995 non-socialist world primary capacity will need to be around 18 mln tonnes whereas on current plans only 15 mln tonnes are scheduled Bird said Bird forecast higher economic growth after 1990 and increased imports by less developed countries Aluminium consumption growth is not expected to accelerate by as much as general growth but non-socialist world consumption is nevertheless forecast to increase sharply from 1377 mln tonnes in 1990 to 1725 mln tonnes in 1995 Bird said Aluminium companies were slow to adjust to the pace of change after 1973 the review said and now they have completed this transition they may be in danger of remaining preoccupied with the strategies of retrenchment and survival which have served them well in recent years In order to encourage the construction of additional smelters aluminium prices will need to settle at a higher level Production costs are likely to rise again in the years ahead as the glut of alumina capacity vanishes and electricity suppliers take a more aggressive line with aluminium companies according to the review At March 1987 prices the three most likely cost-price scenarios call for a long-run aluminium price of between 73 and 895 cents a lb depending on exchange rates Bird said Such a price development is not expected to cause any marked competitive problems for the metal because of the likely rise in commodity prices as a whole and cost pressures in the pipeline for steel and copper In the short term however the outlook is dull Bird said as the world economy has not responded well to the opportunities offered by cheap oil Its 1987 consumption forecast of 1301 mln tonnes is 04 pct down on 1986 while production is forecast six pct higher in 1987 at 1267 mln tonnes

9892	Aluminium scrap recovery and usage and output of secondary metal will continue to rise said Shearson Lehman Brothers in a review of the secondary aluminium market which details cost and demand factors Although primary smelting costs have declined generally in recent years the still substantial energy cost savings offered by secondary smelters will continue to make re-melted material increasingly attractive It takes around 15000 kilowatt hours kwh of electricity to produce one tonne of primary aluminium compared with around 550 kwh for one tonne of secondary metal Shearson said On the demand side developments in automobiles and packaging bode well for secondary aluminium consumption Automobile production although expected to fall this year is still on an upward trend and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future and in addition use of aluminium castings is gaining wider acceptance in the automobile industry particularly in the US In packaging Shearson does not expect aluminium to dominate the beverage can market in any of the other major economies to the extent it does in the US But says there is evidence recycling is on the increase in other countries In addition to the cost savings involved technology advances now enable alloys of higher purity to be produced by the secondary aluminium industry Shearson said There is not likely to be a problem of availability as the US Has a huge scrap reservoir and this is also true of several European countries albeit on a smaller scale
