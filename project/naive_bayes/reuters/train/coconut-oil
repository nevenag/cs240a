13080	US scientists said some tropical vegetable oils can be hazardous to consumers whose health is at risk because of high levels of saturated fat lending weight to a campaign by the American Soybean Association ASA for labelling changes The scientists appeared to support an ASA charge denied by Malaysian palm growers that imported coconut palm and palm kernel oils contain high levels of saturated fat and thus raise blood cholesterol and the risk of heart disease In a petition filed in January the ASA asked the US Food and Drug Administration FDA to require palm palm kernel and coconut oils to be identified as saturated fats on food manufacturers labels The FDA responded to the ASA in a letter saying it would consider the petition as a comment to a proposed rule dealing with cholesterol and fatty acid labelling of foods Malaysian oil palm growers have said the charges by the ASA that palm oil consumption increases blood cholesterol and contributes to heart disease are untrue But Steve Chang Professor of Food Science at Rutgers University said Palm oil is definitely not good for human health because it has a high content of saturated fatty acid He added that the higher the fatty acid the greater the blood cholesterol level It has been well established that high cholesterol levels will have a higher level of heart disease he said A Malaysian Oil Palm Growers Council official Borge Bek-Nielsen has said studies have shown that palm oil is cholesterol-free low in saturated fats has anti-cancer properties and prevents blood clotting and blocking of arteries in humans Bek-Nielsen said Americans consume more saturated fats daily through food like butter bacon ham and beef than from palm oil which he added is rich in vitamins A and E David Kritchevsky Associate Director of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia appeared to take the ASA view on labelling What people really have to learn is to read labels said Kritchevsky The more a consumer knows the more likely he will make an intelligent choice The US scientists said they had no doubt imported palm palm kernel and coconut oils contain high saturated fat levels Kritchevsky a specialist in nutrition said More saturated fat would raise cholesterol levelsSo from that point of view its a health risk High cholesterol levels in the blood are a risk factor for heart disease Susanne Harris deputy assistant secretary of the US Agriculture Departments Food and Consumer Services Division said the health risk among consumers of vegetable oils with high saturated fat levels was highest among those who have heart disease The scientists said more than 50 pct of the fatty acid content of the tropical oils was saturated whereas less than 20 pct of the fatty acid content of soybean oil was saturated David Ericksen director of ASAs technical services said US soybean producers could regain about one-half of the 273 mln dlrs in sales lost to imported tropical oils if consumers were aware the vegetable oils were high in saturated fat Imported tropical oils displace 171 mln bushels of US soybean sales in the US market ASA estimates US imports of coconut oil during January totaled 829 mln lbs compared with 480 mln lbs in December and 1065 mln a year earlier according to Commerce Department figures Imports of palm oil totaled 440 mln lbs compared with 513 mln lbs in December and 852 mln a year earlier
3540	Lower production of coconut and palm oils could lead to a decline in vegetable oil stocks this year despite growing supplies of oilseeds senior oilseeds analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Mario Balletto said Balletto told a conference of Canadian farmers at Alberta Agricultures annual farm outlook conference that the world vegetable oil situation is one of potentially tight supplies Prices for edible oils appear to have more upside potential reflecting strong world demand and an unprecedented decline in the production of tree oils Balletto said Balletto estimated production of palm coconut and palm kernel oils this year at 85 mln tonnes down from 91 mln tonnes last year enough to offset higher oilseed output He estimated total vegetable oil production this year at 334 mln tonnes up from 330 mln last year and disappearance at 340 mln tonnes up from 326 mln Unless oilseed crushing increases sharply he said disappearance of vegetable oils could exceed production by 600000 tonnes the largest deficit since 1976 If world protein meal demand stagnates thus limiting the crush of soybeans  the need for serious supply rationing in the edible oils sector could develop he said This would be relatively favorable for the prices of high oil yielding seeds Balletto said Oilseeds on the other hand remain at depressed prices because of burdensome supplies he said World ending stocks of oilseeds are estimated to increase for the fourth straight year to a record 284 mln tonnes compared with 254 mln last year The increase should result from lower disappearance as production is expected to fall to 1840 mln tonnes from 1857 mln last year he said World soybean production in 1987 totalled a record 989 mln tonnes up from 906 mln the previous year Balletto said while production of other oilseeds was lower Higher soybean production in South America and Europe made up for lower production in the United States he said Soybeans account for the bulk of the surplus and US stocks make up most of those Balletto said The Commodity Credit Corporation owned 127 mln tonnes about half of the world soybean surplus he said Since 1983-84 he said world oilseed stocks have increased 131 mln tonnes During the same period US soybean stocks increased 121 mln tonnes becoming the dumping ground of the entire world surplus courtesy of the CCC and highlighting the artificially high prices caused by the US loan program Soybean prices and to a great extent world oilseeds prices are likely to be dominated by the loan program as long as the US soybean surplus continues For the 1987 crop he said prices are likely to hover in a range tied to the US loan program Upside potential for prices is limited by the huge supply overhang while strong underlying support is provided by the US loan rate The problem is likely to become worse as the artificially high prices encourage producers in South America Canada and Australia to shift from grains to oilseeds Balletto said
6421	Contract terms for trade in coconut oil are to be changed from long tons to tonnes with effect from the AugSep contract onwards Dutch vegetable oil traders said Operators have already started to take account of the expected change and reported at least one trade in tonnes for AugSept shipment yesterday The Federation of Oils Seeds and Fats Associations FOSFA in London said it had previously advised traders to adopt the metric system for coconut oil transactions to bring the commodity into line with other vegetable oils
8596	Philippines Trade and Industry Secretary Jose Concepcion told world trade ministers he wondered if their agreement was of any real value after the European Community EC proposed a levy on vegetable oils Concepcion speaking at an informal meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade GATT here said ministers declared in Uruguay last September that the trade of less-developed nations should not be disrupted He said the EC not only ignored Manilas request for lower tariffs on coconut oil but proposed a levy on vegetable oils and fats that are vital exports for Southeast Asian countries Concepcion said while the levy might be rejected by the EC Council of Ministers he noted that I cannot help but wonder whether the agreements we produce in meetings like this are of any real value He also said industrialised nations saved about 65 billion US Dlrs in 1985 through low commodity prices but this had affected the ability of developing nations to import goods and services The health and the growth of world trade requires that the new development of developing countries losing their share of world trade be arrested and reversed he said
