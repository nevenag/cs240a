1616	Drilling for oil in California is likely to continue at last years sharply reduced levels despite recent gains in crude oil prices industry analysts said Because much of the crude oil in California fields is thick heavy and expensive to extract oil prices would have to increase to near 1985s levels before any significant recovery is seen in drilling they said Companies will probably only drill their best prospects said John Curti an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc Few new wells now are being drilled Only 33 rigs about one-quarter of the total available were drilling for oil onshore in California last week compared to about 70 last year said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil Information Services which tracks California drilling activity Its in the dregs right now said Bolster of the states drilling activity Current prices are not enough to justify increased drilling said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent Producers Association While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact to curb production boosted oil prices early this year prices eventually fell Prices for Californias marker grade Line 63 blend have slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high of about 17 dlrs More than half of Californias oil comes from stripper wells those producing less than 10 barrels a day and that much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to extract Malmgreen said Its not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs Malmgreen said Many stripper wells along the southern California coast produce eight times as much water as crude oil and inland wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur extraction of the thick heavy oil he said The outlook for future production in California is clouded by a lack of exploratory drilling now analysts said In the heart of Californias oil patch Kern County which produces about two-thirds of the states oil exploratory drilling has slowed to a crawl Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in 1986 compared to 137 in 1985 according to David Mitchell of the state energy commission So far this year only five exploratory wells have been drilled I dont think theyll even get to what they did last year Mitchell said No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of the decade Mitchell said Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the number of producing wells and overall production Between February and October of 1986 the number of producing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43521 from more than 50000 said Bill Guerard of the California Energy Commission In line with that decrease Californias crude oil output fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is expected to remain at that lower level analysts said Between February and October 1986 Californias crude oil production slipped from an all-time high of 1185 mln barrels per day to 1066 mln bpd Guerard said Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986 was 408 mln bbls compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405 mln bbl in 1983 according to the California Department of Conservation Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels Guerard said

1711	Texas Railroad Commissioner James Nugent saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait for Congress to act today urged Texas state lawmakers to adopt incentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severance taxes on oil produced from stripper wells Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house of representatives that the state must take the initiative in molding US energy policy and finding new ways to assist troubled oil producers His proposal to revitalize Texas oil industry would exempt stripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each day from the states 46 pct severance tax He said that the majority of Texas oil wells fall within the stripper well category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be crucial in determining if the well remains in production Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves Secondary and tertiary oil production expensive methods of production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover oil should also be exempted from the severance tax Nugent said His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day for three years or until the price of oil reaches 25 a barrel Weve been sitting back and waiting on two federal administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the nation to follow I say we have waited long enough Nugent said In other words lets tell Washington to either lead follow or get out of the way Nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasury by exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxes would be more than made up by stimulating new business for the oil supply and service industry

10078	British Petroleum Co Plc does not intend to raise the price of its planned 70 dlr per share offer for the publicly held 45 pct of Standard Oil Co BP Managing Director David Simon said We dont seen this as any progressive bidding game he told reporters at a news conference BP now owns 55 pct of Standards stock Simon said BP had carefully considered the amount of its planned bid and he quoted an oil analyst whom he would not identify as saying BPs careful evaluation means the company is not going to raise its offer I think that an increase would be totally wrong I think the price is very fair and it is much to early to speculate about ligigation he said Lets wait and see how the offer runs Another official declined to speculate under what circumstances BP might raise its bid The BP official said the 70 dlrs a share offer is 72 times Standards 1986 cash flow and 56 pct above an independent evaluation of the companys assets including the value of its oil natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves He said the price Royal DutchShell Group ltRD ltSC paid for publicly held Shell Oil Co shares in 1985 was 51 times cash flow The BP official also said the 70 dlr bid is a 40 pct premium over Standards stock price over the past year BP Group Treasurer Rodney Chase said more than half to as much as two-thirds of the 74 billion dlrs BP needs for its offer will come from existing sources The rest will be financed by new debt BP will draw in cash from its operating companies around the world and is also arranging a five billion dlr line of credit he explained The companys debt to equity ratio will rise 11 or 12 percentage points from the current 33 pct if the offer is completed Chase said But the ratio will be back below 40 pct within 12 months he added Chase also said 50 to 60 pct of Standard Oils publicly held shares are held by financial institutions Simon said Standards board was informed of the offer on March nine and has been considering it since that time He said BP does not expect any regulatory problems that would delay completion of the acquisition We have informed Washington of our intentions and weve already been an integral part of ownership of US oil reserves he pointed out Simon said there is a good chance that current world oil prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel could be maintained and that the more stable market is due mostly to changes in policy in Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members to control oil production We think there are signals that current conditions are more favorable than they have been for sometime Simon said We have hopes for greater stability but we do not see prices going much higher he added
10080	British Petroleum Plcs plan to pay 74 billion dlrs for less than half of Standard Oil Co has signalled higher values in the US oil patch analysts said I think that BPs bid is a very strong affirmation and clear signal that they have confidence in the US and they think the barrel of oil in the ground is going to go higher said Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc BP earlier today said its US unit planned to tender at 70 dlrs per share for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already own Its a 74 billion dlr price that shows OPEC has won the war and oil prices are not going to crack said Prescott Ball and Turben analyst Bruce Lazier Behind that is a huge implication for the rest of the energy issues out there in the stock market particularly those that are acquisition targets Lazier said One of those mentioned by Lazier was USX Corp an energy-steel concern which had been courted by investor Carl Icahn and drew the attention of Australian Robert Holmes a Court last year Rumors continue to swirl around its stock Margoshes said he does not foresee major US oil firms falling into takeover situations for several years with the exception of possibly Amerada Hess Corp ltAHC He said most of the majors found partners in the last round of matchmaking which ended two years ago and others restructured to the point that they have become unattractive US oil stocks rallied in response to the offer Exxon Corp ltXON rose 1-18 to 88-12 Chevron Corp ltCHV jumped 1-18 to 58-78 and Texaco ltTX climbed 14 to 37-34 Unocal Corp ltUCL rose 1-34 while Occidental Petroleum Corp ltOXY climbed 1-18 to 34-34 Amoco Corp ltAN rose 1-38 to 83-34 Standard Oils stock was up 6-14 in heavy trading to 71-18 Earlier in the session it had been at a high of 72-14 Wall Street has speculated British Petroleum may boost its offer by several dlrs per share but the company maintained it would not raise the 70 dlr bid British Petroleum stock rose 2-14 to 59-58 Analysts said the fact British Petroleum made such a bid in the first place indicates that the British oil giant has changed its outlook for the oil industry Analysts said last year British Petroleum held one of the more bearish positions on oil prices They said the real price of oil would stay at 15 dlrs a barrel for several years and I think they beat a hasty retreat from that point of view Margoshes said They are more appropriately today looking more optimistically I believe they are looking at 18 dlrs long-termalso in their heart of hearts they believe that will be exceeded Margoshes said The US benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate was trading today around 1860 dlrs per barrel Analysts said British Petroleum might have been able to buy up the rest of Standard Oil for about 50 dlrs per share when oil prices were falling last year They said Standard Oils brightest asset is its slightly more than 50 pct ownership of the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oil field Analysts also said the company has other interests in the Alaskan North Slope Analysts said the Standard investment is extremely attractive to BP because the US is the largest oil market and has hard-to-replace reserves I think it just fits in with their long-range plans to increase their position in the US market Dean Witter analyst Eugene Nowak said Analysts said it also raises BPs visibility ahead of the British governments announced disposal of 317 pct of BP stock The UK government said it would dispose of the holding sometime in the year beginning April one After acquiring all of Standard most of BPs reserves would be in the US but only about six pct of its stock is held in the US The only way they can sell all that stock is to move it into the United States No other market can handle all that stock said LF rothschild analyst Rosario Ilacqua In 1986 Standard Oil had net losses of 345 mln dlrs on revenues of 1002 billion dlrs compared to a profit the year earlier of 308 mln dlrs on revenues of 1382 billion dlrs

13256	Growth in oil consumption in the Western industrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 23 pct in 1986 the International Energy Agency IEA said Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around one pct in first quarter 1987 to 359 mln bpd the IEA said in its Monthly Oil Market Report Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels as in 1986 But if average consumer prices are higher than 1986 the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last years 36 pct it said The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product prices stay close to current levels some destocking by end-users can be expected If that happens natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986 and there may be slightly less growth in transport fuels IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at 428 mln tonnes representing 98 days of forward consumption This is about the same level as at the begining of the year The agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset a reduction in stocks It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by 12 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the year This followed a small rise in January of 04 mln bpd but a decline of 15 mln bpd in February and 25 mln bpd in March It is possible that final data will show a larger draw particulary for March it said As crude production also fell there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks particularly at sea the IEA said Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes on April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986 Governments built up strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in the period The year-on-year trend of government stock building is continuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising more or less in line with consumption after declining for five years the IEA noted Oil stocks on land in the US And Canada were put at 2066 mln tonnes on April 1 down from the 214 mln tonnes on January 1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption respectively Oil stocks in Western Europe were 1474 mln tonnes on April 1 down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln bpd to 452 mln bpd from 472 mln bpd in last quarter 1986 This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude production to around 155 mln bpd in FebruaryMarch from 165 mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from centrally-planned Economies the IEA said Total OPEC crude oil supply was 158 mln bpd in the first quarter plus 14 mln bpd of NGLs compared with 173 mln bpd of crude in the last three months of 1986 and 179 mln average for the whole of 1986 Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 mln bpd against 285 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986 A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast 33 mln bpd in March from 36 mln bpd in February was the largest factor behind the OPEC production decline the IEA said Saudi Arabias Opec-assigned output quota is 4133 mln bpd

2061	Royal DutchShell Group ltRDAS earnings for 1986 from the US Fell sharply because of difficult market conditions lower crude and gas prices and also due to different accounting methods Shell chairman Peter Holmes said The Shell Oil dollar net income fell 47 pct in the year while the additional effect of currency movements reduced the contribution to group net income by 57 pct to 472 mln stg The group earlier reported a drop in net income for the year to 254 billion stg from 303 billion previously with lower crude prices outweighing the effect of increased sales by volume Although the figures were lower they were nonetheless at the top end of market forecasts Shell Transport and Trading Plc ltSCL shares the UK Arm of the group rose to 1139 stg from a close last night of 1106 stg Analysts noted that a general collapse in exploration and production volumes was partially offset by earnings from chemicals rising to 462 mln stg from 205 mln in 1985 Also a windfall tax credit and lower than expected currency losses had added about 100 mln stg onto fourth quarter results which was the main reason for the figures exceeding forecasts industry analyst Chris Rowland of Barclays de Zoete Wedd noted However he added there could well be a sharp fall in performance in the first quarter of 1987 due to the improbability that the group would be able to repeat the high refining and marketing margins of first quarter 1986 The impact of recovering oil prices would come through faster on the downstream side than on the upstream as such a high proportion of upstream activity centred on gas which typically reacted to oil price changes with about a half-year lag analysts said Holmes said that in the upstream US Sector the third quarter of 1986 had been the worst of all Only two of the oil majors had managed to make a profit in the period with Shell Oil being one of them The decrease in US Earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the group had increased share to become volume market leader Holmes added Continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdue US Exploration activity Exploration is currently pretty flat We are going to go on but at 16-18 dlrs there will be no massive upturn he said A renewal of exploration in high cost areas of the North Sea and the US Requires prices of around 25 dlrs a barrel Ultimately this would lead to a rise in US Imports If you are not exploring you are not going to find anything he noted US Oil production had dropped some half mln barrels a day bbd in 1986 and would continue to fall if the price stayed below 20 dlrs a barrel This favored OPECs attempts to stabilise prices as the lower the price the more likelihood there was of non-OPEC marginal production shutting down OPEC has done pretty extraordinarily wellEverything is moving in its direction he added
2121	OPEC output in February was well below the 158 mln bpd ceiling it set in December and all countries are strictly adhering to their quotas the OPEC news agency Opecna quoted an OPEC secretariat official as saying The official was quoted as saying that lower output was the result of member countries firm determination to defend the organisations official price of 18 dlrs per barrel and to refrain from selling any quantity below that price The unnamed official was further quoted as saying that no OPEC meeting was foreseen before the next biannual OPEC session planned to start on June 25 The official gave no figure for February output The statement said only that the reduction in total supplies namely actual exports of crude oil and products plus local deliveries in member countries is even more pronounced as those supplies fell very noticeably during that month No matter what the pressure on member countries by lifters to align the official selling price to the ongoing market price member countries are without exception strictly adhering to the official selling price in spite of the financial hardship this may entail the statement said The very recent improvement in the price structure is an indicator of such determination by the organization to stick to the official selling price the statement said Free spot market prices rose from around 1450 dlrs a barrel in early December last year to near OPECs official levels towards the end of the year after the OPEC pact There has been oil industry speculation that OPEC might have to hold an extraordinrary meeting prior to its scheduled June session to discuss reports of overproduction by some states and strains on the differential matrix which prices each OPEC crude according to its quality and distance from main markets The official said in the statement that no such emergency session was scheduled because of member countries firm determination to defend the price system agreed in December Opecs differential committee was to have met in Vienna starting April 2 but this session has been postponed with no new date set according to an official of the United Arab Emirates which chairs the seven-state body Other members are Algeria Kuwait Saudi Arabia Libya Nigeria and Qatar

2383	Opec Conference President Rilwanu Lukman said the group was producing well below the 158 mln bpd ceiling it set in December partly because liftings had been delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed Opec prices Lukman during a brief visit to London on his way home from Jamaica told Reuters in a telephone interview that in February Opec had underproduced partly because members were strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel We are determined to stand firm by the December accord he said I have spoken to every other Opec minister and they are committed to making the accord work he said Lukman gave no specific figures for February output He said the Opec secretariat in Vienna was finalizing these figures Told of a Reuters survey published today which estimated that Opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd he said That could well be correct Opecs news agency Opecna today issued a statement saying group output was well below its ceiling in February But it gave no figures But one source close to Opec indicated that February output may have been between 153 and 155 mln bpd The Reuter survey estimated Opec February output at around 16 mln bpd Opec agreed in December to cut output by 725 pct to 158 mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1 Lukman said Qatar Nigeria Saudi Arabia and Iran had all produced in February below their Opec quotas Iraq which said it would not honour its 1466 mln bpd quota under the December pact had produced less than had been anticipated he said Lukman said that some industry reports may be correct that in February Nigeria propuced 75-100000 bpd below its 1238 mln bpd quota Saudi Arabia 500000 bpd less than its 4133 mln allocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285000 bpd quota He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his country were coming under price pressure because they were currently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades and the United States West Texas Intermediate WTI crude However he said Opec in December had anticipated that demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks We have to be patient for two or three weeks The market is now firming on actual fundamentals he said adding that he expected it to go up and up even beyond official prices after early April This is when traditionally there is more demand for gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigerias The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait Venezuela and Indonesia were having less problems with output than producers like his own country because they exported oil products Also some of Venezuelas heavy grades were outside the Opec pricing system he said Lukman said that if refiner-buyers now refusing to lift some Opec oil at official prices instead used their own stocks and ran them down to dangerous levels they would eventually have to buy Opec oil When they realise it is not a free-for-all in the market they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more later on he said Lukman asked about industry reports that Nigeria was being pressured by equity producers for better terms said it was important to know that terms with them were negotiable flexible and under constant review not only when the market seemed weak He said that so far no meeting of the seven-nation ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that such a meeting now twice-postponed was not a high priority for Opec at the moment At this time we have to get our priorities right he said The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is working not dealing with a differential of cents between grades But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections over the differential system a meeting would be called he said

2925	Higher oil prices and stronger than expected US employment growth led to sharp losses in US interest rate futures and diminished what had been a positive chart outlook financial analysts said The increase of 319000 in non-farm payroll employment during February was above market expectations for a rise of 170000 to 200000 jobs and sparked selling in Treasury bond futures that drove the June contract through key technical support at 101-232 at the opening Friday they noted I dont like that fact that we had a close below 101 said Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner The 101-232 level in the June bond contract had been the top of a three-month trading range which when penetrated during the rally Wednesday led to bullish forecasts by chartists But analysts called it a false breakout on the weekly charts when the June bond closed at 100-1032 Friday Some also forecast that the high of the week at 101-1932 may signal a bearish double top formation portending steep losses I tend to go along with the double top scenario said Northern Futures analyst Eileen Rico Rico noted that the possible formation along with the fact that the rally of the last two weeks in bond futures has occurred on relatively low volume were negative signals Despite what could be a negative chart outlook Leiner remains cautiously optimistic and June bonds should find support between 100 and 99-1632 next week The optimistic outlook as well as Leiners expectation that the yield curve will flatten in the near term is based on an improving inflation outlook With the dollar stable and economic data giving the Federal Reserve little room to ease monetary policy the inflation outlook is improving Leiner said and that should lead to relatively stronger bond prices than bill and Eurodollar prices Still Leiner noted that the recent rise in oil prices remains a concern for the inflation outlook Oil rose during the week on reports that OPEC nations were maintaining production quotas and official prices and got an extra boost Friday due to the suspension of oil exports from Ecuador after an earthquake Thursday The runup in crude oil will be a short-lived phenomenon said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Brian Singer The rise in oil prices over the past week has been largely media induced Singer said He noted that even though OPEC production may be within quotas oil stocks are at tremendously high levels Although the Ecuador situation could cause a delay oil prices will eventually decline to the lows of late February he said and that will be a supportive influence for bond prices

3065	The 24 nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD hampered by sluggish industrial output and trade face slower economic growth and their joint balance of payments will swing into deficit in 1987 the Economist Intelligence Unit EIU  said The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD economic growth downwards to 25 pct this year compared with a 28 pct growth forecast in December It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the smaller European countries it influences and Japan hardest hit by currency appreciation this year The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth rate forecasts for West Germany to 22 pct from 32 pct in December and to 23 pct from three pct for Japan It said it expected the OECD to post a current account deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988 due in large part to a 150 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices It said the US Current account deficit looked likely to fall even more slowly than forecast to 125 billion dlrs in 1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986 It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 1650 dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 1550 dlrs in 1988 from about 18 dlrs last year as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes increasingly ragged It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in foreign exchange markets and will lose a further 13 pct on its trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last years 184 pct drop The average markdollar rate is put at 180 marks this year and 170 in 1988 while the yendollar rate is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988 it said This is not a crash scenario but the dollars steeper angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather than a three-point landing the EIU said Talking will not stop the dollars slide for long and the February meeting of finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan or a tighter US Fiscal policy it said It said the key to the dollars fortunes was the willingness of Japanese institutions to buy US Government assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss Thus far they have been willing the EIC said adding that if Japan was deterred from buying US Bonds the dollar would collapse To contain such a currency crisis dollar interest rates would have to soar bringing recession and a Third World debt crisis it said On trade the EIU said prospects for 1987 look increasingly sick Import growth forecast in December at 45 pct is now seen slowing down to around 38 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to 42 pct in 1988 it said The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest single factor with import growth there expected to feature a sluggish 35 pct growth in 1987 against the 65 pct forecast in December the EIU said On the export side it said it saw weak demand in West Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe while Japans exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by US Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower more competitively-priced dollar It said in most of Europe and in Japan raw materials and oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986 However rates of inflation will edge up in 1988 to over the current OECD average of three pct Non-oil commodity prices will show a modest dollar price increase in 1988 for the first time since 1984 the EIU said After a rise of 18 pct in 1986 the dollar price of internationally traded manufactures will go up by 85 pct in 1987 and by five pct in 1988 it said It said OECD industrial production would rise by only 16 pct in 1987 after a weak 15 pct increase in 1986

3571	OPEC has reaffirmed its commitment to fixed crude oil prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel and an overall output ceiling of 158 mln barrels per day bpd to defend prices its president Rilwanu Lukman said He told a news conference here After due consultation with my colleagues in OPEC I hereby wish to emphasize that Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices Lukman added no extraordinary OPEC conference was planned We are in a position to re-confirm that despite misleading news in foreign media to the contrary  OPEC member countries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in the month of February Lukman who is Nigerian oil minister said Lukman put the overall OPEC output shortfall in February at 900000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firm determination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrs agreed upon last December in Geneva The December agreement set an overall output ceiling for OPEC of 158 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixed prices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord but fell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing more than the agreed level The idea was to suggest that OPECs agreement would not hold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases of OPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs Lukman said He said the 900000 bpd shortfall last February was based on the verified figure for 10 out of OPECs 13 members adding that Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100000 bpd Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement while the production figures of Ecuador and the United Arab Emirates needed to be verified Lukman said If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreement succeed we are ready  OPEC is not changing its price level of 18 dlrs the groups president said He said the OPEC price differentials committee meeting formerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely Furthermore no extraordinary meeting of the conference is at the moment contemplated since most agreements reached in December are being adhered to he said Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrow the gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes -- fixed in relation to the 18 dlr benchmark -- Lukman replied We consider the defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawn on stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels well below this time last year and soon they would return to the market in search of crude We dont see that there is going to be any difficulty in maintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year Lukman said The OPEC president praised non-OPEC oil producers which he said had contributed to the groups efforts to stabilise prices but he criticised Britain for maintaining its long-held view not to do anything to help the market We are quite confident however that in the long-term with two-thirds of the worlds reserves in OPEC hands the future is ours We will use that advantage responsibly he said Lukman described the disruption in Ecuadors output following an earthquake as tragic but refused to say if the South American country would be allowed a higher output quota when it recovered from the disaster

6086	Two new UK Tax relief measures for oil producers announced today are aimed at encouraging developments in the North Sea to go ahead and boost opportunities for the offshore supplies industry the Inland Revenue said in a post-budget statement Earlier Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced in his annual budget to Parliament that from today companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying development expenditure on certain future oil fields against Petroleum Revenue Tax PRT To date full relief was allowed for expenditure on an individual field itself when its income stream began but was not immediately available against other development expenditure the statement said The new relief will apply to fields outside the southern basin for which development consent is first given on or after today and will improve the post-tax economics of new developments and encourage companies to proceed with project which might have been delayed it said Lawson also announced that he would henceforth allow certain expenditure on oil related research which does not at present qualify for PRT relief to be offset against PRT liability This means oil-related expenditure in the UK Or on the UK Continental shelf which has not become allowable in a particular field within three years of being incurred to be allowed against PRT liability in any oil field the Inland Revenue said This brings the scope of PRT relief for research costs more in line with corporation tax relief measures and is planned to encourage general research into ways of reducing field development costs it said In due course the industry should benefit by over 100 mln stg a year it calculated The Inland Revenue statement also included other technical measures that Lawson did not comment on in his budget speech These included measures to allow companies to balance their shares of PRT-exempt oil allowances through reallocation in two past periods of allowance utilisation Tidier rules on incorrectly allowed PRT expenditure reliefs were announced while there were also ammendments on rules on corporation tax and Advance Corporation Tax relating to the so-called ring fence of activities in the UK And its continental shelf The Finance Bill will have provisions for the implementation of measures announced in November it said Gareth Lewis Davies a North Sea expert with stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Inc in Edinburgh thought the two reliefs on PRT would help the depressed offshore industry He said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief would favour chances that development of smaller North Sea fields such Osprey Don and Arbroath would be brought forward Early development of the larger Miller and Bruce oil fields might also be encouraged he said Lewis Davies said the measure might also aid the offshore construction industry which suffered a huge amount of lay-offs under the price slump of more than 50 pct last year He pointed out that the relief only applies to the development of new fields outside the Southern Basin This means more jobs could be created as the fields in the central and northern sectors of the North Sea are deeper than in the south and thus have greater capital and labour requirements as the waters are deeper than in the south He said the PRT relief for certain research expenditure would help fundamental research in the oil industry although the benefits of this research would not be seen for several year

6656	The drastic cutbacks in US drilling last year are rapidly deflating the United States natural gas bubble which could bring spot shortages in gas supplies next winter and a modest recovery in the oilpatch industry analysts said Faltering deliverability of natural gas a commodity that is difficult and costly to import in large quantities could more than double the current US rig count to near 2000 by 1990 some analysts said The need to lock in future supplies of gas for utilities and big industrial customers may also bring a resurgence of activity in the Gulf of Mexicos offshore waters where some of the nations largest gas reserves are located We think an upturn in US drilling is imminent said James Crandall an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc Many companies appear to be switching from oil to gas drilling because theyre betting that the gas market will be back in balance in a year or two The prospect of diminishing gas supplies is welcome news for drilling and oilfield service companies that barely survived last years plunge in oil prices from about 30 dlrs a barrel to less than half that Todays relatively stable oil prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel are not enough to spur a return to the heady days of 1981 when the US drilling rig count soared to a record high of more than 4500 and oilfield roustabouts commanded premium wages The latest weekly Hughes Tool Co ltHT rig count a barometer of the oil industrys health showed 761 US rigs active in what is traditionally the slowest time of the year In 1986 the Hughes rig count began the year at 1915 but dived to a post-World War II low of 663 in July as world oil prices experienced the sharpest decline in recent times Ike Kerridge a Hughes economist said In 1986 the United States replaced only about 40 pct of the gas it used and that replacement rate wont be any better this year He added We dont have the options we do with oil Imports of gas from Canada are limited by pipeline capacity and importing liquefied natural gas on ships will not be feasible in the next 10 years because of the cost Only about 6 trillion cubic feet of additional gas reserves were discovered last year while US consumption approached 16 trillion cubic feet according to industry estimates George Gaspar an oil analyst with Robert W Baird and Co agreed that the need for gas supplies would set the stage for a new cycle of gradual increases in US drilling We anticipate that natural gas pipelines will need to dedicate to their systems new gas reserves for 1989 and 1990 supplies That means new drilling programs must begin no later than mid-1988 Gaspar said Gasper said he sees a new drilling cycle emerging that could last until 1992 and that he expects the average rig count to peak near 2000 in December of 1989 Much of the search for new gas reserves is likely to be conducted in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico where federal leases on unexplored areas will revert back to the government unless drilling begins in the next two or three years Some of the industrys biggest companies such as Exxon Corp ltXON Mobil Corp MOB and Union Texas Petroleum have already indicated plans to increase spending for drilling later this year in the Gulf of Mexico Crandall said For example Conoco Inc a Dupont ltDD subsidiary will spend 400 mln dlrs to build the Gulf of Mexicos deepest production platform which will produce 50 mln cubic feet of gas per day But T Boone Pickens who has acquired huge Texas and Kansas gas reserves for his Mesa Limited Partnership ltMLP in recent months is not convinced that the drilling industry is on the verge of a recovery Pickens predicts the US rig count will soon drop below 600 and will not increase significantly until oil prices do The rigs wont go back to work until the price of oil gets above 30 dlrs a barrel said Pickens 58 adding he did not expect to see the rig count top 2000 again in his lifetime Tenneco Inc ltTGT one of the largest US gas producers is skeptical that a need for additional gas drilling exists Tenneco vice president Joe Foster said he did not expect significant increases in drilling for gas until the early 1990s when the US gas reserves life will have declined to about seven years supply Current spot market prices of about 150 dlrs per thousand cubic feet will need to rise to about three dlrs to spur reserve replacement he said
6722	The US oil and gas industry is in better health than it was a year ago according to testimony given to the Texas Railroad Commission at its annual state of the industry hearing today The Commission which regulates the states oil and gas industry heard testimony from a number of high-level company executives reflecting a belief that the recent industry downturn had bottomed out The attitude expressed here today so far is a great deal more optimistic than last year Commissioner James E Jim Nugent told Reuters It reflects their the executives belief that they are seeing the bottom of the economic cycle he added and with just a few reasonable breaks this industry can begin to move again The energy industry was hard hit by the sharp drop in oil prices which fell from around 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 to as low as 10 dlrs in mid-1986 Prices have since steadied to around 18 dlrs a barrel At the same time a number of company executives testified that the nations domestic exploration and production segment was still hurting and in need of government help Production costs are considerably higher in the United States than in such areas as the Middle East and as prices fell many domestic producers were forced to shut down their operations Currently there are only about 760 oil rigs operating in the United States compared with an average of nearly 2000 in 1985 Citing a study released yesterday by the Department of Energy many said the falling production of domestic oil coupled with increasing US demand was leading to a growing dependency on imports particularly from the politically volatile Middle East In the US 1986 petroleum production responded to lower prices increasing about 25 pct or 400000 barrels per day bpd said JS Simon General Manager of the Supply Department at Exxon Corp ltXON the nations largest oil company At the same time Simon said US oil production declined by 300000 bpd the first decline in several years and net petroleum imports were up 25 pct to 53 mln bpd Noting that while oil prices were expected to remain between 13 and 20 dlrs a barrel depending on OPECs ability to control production Simon said demand is expected to remain at 1986 levels leading to a significant amount of spare worldwide production capacity in excess of 10 mln bpd He said the surplus capacity would lead to continued volatility and called for governmental and regulatory policies in support of the domestic petroleum industry Citing the costs recently imposed by the federal government through the 1986 tax code changes and Superfund legislation Simon called for the repeal of the windfall profits tax total decontrol of natural gas and improved access to federal lands for oil and gas exploration Simon did not mention an oil import fee which many in the industry have called for as a way of building up the nations domestic operations before imports reach such a level that national security might be compromised In yesterdays report the Energy Department said imports could make up 50 pct of US demand by 1995 adding that Persian Gulf producers will provide as much as 65 pct of the free worlds total oil consumption by that date Arguing that oil is a political tool in every nation on earth Frank Pitts chairman of ltPitts Oil Co today called for a variable oil import fee among other measures before the treacherous foothold of the Middle East is irreversible and our national security is compromised Royce Wisenbaker Chairman of Wisenbaker Production Co agreed saying that like many federal government programs that were set up with good intentions it would probably turn into a shambles Wisenbaker added that he was optimistic for the future For those of us who have managed to hold on the worst is over he said Roger Hemminghaus President of Diamond Shamrock Refining and Marketing Co said he was enthusiastic about the future adding that he expected an increase in profitability by midyear

6791	ESSO SAF ltESSFPA the French subsidiary of Exxon Corp ltXON said it had no immediate plans to shut down one of its two refineries Exxons new president Lee R Raymond said earlier that it could decide to close a French refinery An ESSO SAF spokesman said a closure was a hypothesis that depended on the evolution of the market and refineries ability to make money He said Port Jerome west of Paris and Fos sur Mer on the Mediterranean had benefitted from new investment over 1985-86 and had last year broken even after stock losses The Port Jerome refinery has an annual production capacity of seven mln tonnes while Fos sur Mers is five mln the spokesman added Industry sources said the easiest plant to dispose of would be Fos sur Mer because it is a single refinery while the Port Jerome refinery is attached to a wider complex comprising a petrochemical plant and a lubricant production plant Raymond was quoted as saying in a published interview that Exxon was reviewing its worldwide refinery operations and might decide to close one of its French refineries
6876	The US Congress and the oil industry are deeply divided on ways the government should assist the industry hurt by the sharp fall in oil prices and the subsequent growth in oil imports industry analysts said The industry is deeply divided between those who support an oil tariff and those who believe tax incentives are better said Daniel Yergin director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates which recently completed a survey of the US Congress on energy issues Yergin said he saw mounting support within Congress for tax incentives rather than an oil tariff or import fee Today US Energy Secretary John Herington said he will propose tax incentives to increase edomestic oil and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for consideration White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the proposal would be reviewed Herrington said I would like to shoot for one mln barrels a day addition to US production US oil output was off to 84 mln bpd in the week of March 13 down six pct from last year the American Petroleum Institute said Oil industry analysts have forecast oil prices to average about 18 dlrs a barrel for the year and many believe that a move above that level will be unlikey for the near term Paul Mlotok oil analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc said that even with the rise in prices for the last week or two weve only altered our average price scenerio to about 1750 dlrs for the year Analysts said that at that price renewed drilling and exploration to reverse the decline in US crude oil output will not take place as the companies are waiting for stable prices over 20 dlrs to renew exploration John Lichtblau president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation Inc in New york in recent testimony to Congress said The continuing decline in US oil production is virtually inevitable under any realistic price scenario But the future rate of decline is very much a function of world oil prices and US government policy Lichtbalu said that tax breaks could be used to raise oil production but would only work over time Lowering the producing industrys tax burden would probably be a slower stimulant to output than a price increase but would not raise energy costs Lichtblau said But the small independent oil companies who do much of the drilling in the US are looking for the more immediate relief which could be brought on by an oil import fee Ronald Tappmeyer president of the International Association of Drilling Contractors said The members of our trade asssociation are convinced that only a variable oil import fee that sets a minimum price trigger can protect our nation The association represents some 1300 drilling and oil service companies The CERA survey of Congress shows that the oil import fee will face a stiff uphill battle Yergin said that the poll which was conducted in January by a former Congressman Orval Hansen showed support for the oil import fee from 22 pct of the Congressmen surveyed largely as a means of protecting the domestic petroleum industry At the same time 48 pct of the Congressmen surveyed opposed the fee with the respondents saying the tariff would hurt consumers and some regional interests But 80 pct of the sample said support for a fee could grow if production continued to fall and imports to rise Yergin said that imports above 50 pct of US requirements is a critical symbolic level If they imports move above that level a fee may not be legislated but there will certainly be pressure for some form of action But Lichtblau in a telephone interview said a 50 pct rate of import dependency is not likely to happen before 1990 In 1986 US oil imports rose to 33 pct of us energy requirements and shopuld be about 34 pct in 1987 he added

6996	Higher world oil prices coupled with a new realism ushered in by austerity could lift Saudi Arabias economy after five years of falling revenue and growing budget deficits bankers and diplomats said The months ahead will prove critical as the government attempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices and fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private sector Economists said oil earnings could recover this year to about 20 billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product could grow by about three pct the first rise since 1982 But the economists said this will be possible only if the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC succeeds in defending world oil prices and if Saudi Arabia is not forced to curtail output for too long Saudi Arabia is now keeping production down to defend OPECs newly-established 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters output is running at about three mln barrels per day bpd well down on Saudi Arabias OPEC quota of 413 mln set for the first half of 1987 King Fahd has stamped his personal authority on OPECs new-found determination to defend prices in a move Western diplomats believe underlines the kingdoms need to secure a stable source of income for its economy Saudi Arabia still the worlds largest oil exporter is a hugely wealthy country But the past five years of declining revenue have taken their toll Economists estimate gross domestic product fell 10 pct last year and 86 pct in 1985 Oil revenue last year when prices briefly dipped below 10 dlrs per barrel probably totalled no more than 175 billion dlrs compared to a peak 1018 billion in 1981 Austerity is still the watchword but Saudi Arabia will not be allowed to dip further into recession  The Saudis can afford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst effects a diplomat said In the short-term the kingdom can lessen the impact of lower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on foreign reserves still put at around 100 billion dlrs But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely Bankers and diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in the longer term It also increases the dominance of the public sector at a time when the government is publicly urging private enterprise to take over the lead role in the economy Bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of the risks attached to this policy but is determined to tough it out on the oil front even if that means a short-term depletion of reserves The 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 527 billion riyals or 31 pct of total outlay The budget explicitly recognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign borrowing has been ruled out Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim told Saudi businessmen this week the government had carefully considered the need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget plans late last year It therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50 billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the economy he said Reserves were built up during the late 1970s and early 1980s when Saudi Arabias breakneck pace of construction and tales of high spending became legendary The shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the fabric of the Kingdoms private sector where poor management had gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom Modern techniques of cost control have been introduced markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut back The expatriate workforce has fallen sharply The number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but Saudi banks hit hard by non-performing loans to the corporate sector have become highly selective in extending new credit Government moves to encourage lending and investigate company complaints about late public sector contract payments could boost confidence but recession has slowed the nations industrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment Private wealth is still very high and banks report more and more cash being placed on deposit As Saudi Arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic development from the public to the private sector one of the biggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channel personal savings into industrial projects within the kingdom and refrain from the temptation to invest abroad

7097	Energy Secretary John Herrington said his proposed option to raise the oil depletion allowance to 275 pct was probably the most economically promising way to spur domestic production The White House has said it would consider the option although it was generally opposed to any revisions in the new tax code Herrington told a meeting of the Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association that the higher depletion allowance on new oil and enhanced oil recovery would cost taxpayers about 200 mln dlrs a year The option was one of many contained in a report on oil and the national security the Energy Department sent to the White House on Tuesday Herrington said of the increased depletion allowance option that is one that could significantly increase production at a very low cost to the American taxpayer He again rejected an oil import fee as far too costly to the overall US economy

7355	The cross field allowance relief on Petroleum Revenue Tax PRT announced by UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson this week will favour smaller non-PRT paying fields according to stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co The cross field allowance offsets up to 10 pct of qualifying spending on a new oil field against PRT liability of other fields It is restricted to new offshore developments outside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field not paying PRT due to its small size the relief would directly benefit in PRT saving on an existing field The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participators in those fields which have no PRT liability the report said adding that the timing of development of such fields may be advanced The government would in effect be subsidising these developments at 75 pct of capital expenditure before corporation tax the report said On fields likely to pay PRT in the future the benefit is of timing Although liabilities on other existing fields will be reduced immediately liabilities on larger new fields will rise in the future due to the loss of offsets it said In a study on probable fields the report said that when the rates of return are examined the rise for a PRT-paying field such as Miller the largest undeveloped oil field in the UK North Sea is from 187 to 19 pct while the rise for a small non-PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 159 to 179 pct The report added that in fields which pay PRT there will be a cost in being able to have this early relief Not only will these costs be unavailable for offset against the fields future profits but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs will be lost Thus a saving of PRT of 100 when field development starts will have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a later time

8041	Higher crude oil prices will raise demand for natural gas helping it to reclaim market share lost to heavy oil when prices plunged in 1986 analysts said The analysts said that these efforts will be most successful in the industrial sectors of the economy with large and growing energy requirements Natural gas stands a good chance to recapture the share of oil supplied to electric utilities that it lost to the residual fuel industry last year Michael Smolinski an energy economist with Data Resources Inc told Reuters An estimated 200000 barrels per day of residual fuel went into the utilities market at the expense of natural gas last year when world oil prices plunged Smolinski said Assuming oil prices hold above 15 dlrs a barrel national average gas prices delivered to the utilities at a projected 210 to 225 dlrs per mln Btu would be very competitive Michael German vice president of economic analysis at American Gas Association said The average delivered prices at the end of January were 210 dlrs per mln Btu compared with 326 dlrs a year ago We expect natural gas to regain 250 to 400 billion cubic feet of demand in the overall energy market in the second and third quarter 1987 he said In addition to price competitiveness availability will be an important factor persuading energy users to switch to gas Frank Spadine senior energy economist with Bankers Trust Corp in New York noted Spadine said the mild winter in many parts of the North American continent has led to a build up of gas inventories and less would be necessary to replenish underground storage this spring freeing gas for spot sales These forecasts develop a strong counterpoint to the fears that natural gas suplies would be tight and prices significantly higher given a sharp decline in drilling last year AGAs German contended that despite the drilling decline much of US proved reserves could be brought to production quickly through developments such as the infill drilling which permits more wells to be drilled in proved reserve basins Citing recent EIA statistics German said the gas surplus was likely to contract from three trillion cubic feet in 1986 to two trillion cubic feet in 1987 but the surplus would not go away until 1990 Smolinski of Data Resources agreed that the surplus would persist until 1990 While gas supplies may tighten in certain consuming areas notably in California and in the Northeast US an overall shortfall appeared remote

8117	The governments over-reliance on revenue from crude oil is adversely affecting Australias economic performance Australian Petroleum Exploration Association APEA chairman Dennis Benbow said Over one-third of Australias indirect tax income is derived from oil at a time of falling domestic output and weak crude prices he told the APEA annual conference here This dependence on oil-generated revenue distorts the countrys economic performance directly by acting as a disincentive to new exploration and indirectly by affecting trading competitiveness through high energy costs he said Australias medium-term liquid fuel self-sufficiency position is posing a major economic threat yet the governments response has been to load new tax burdens on the oil industry Benbow said Domestic oil output from existing fields is expected to fall to 280000 barrels per day bpd in fiscal 199293 from 546000 bpd in 198586 reflecting mainly the decline of the Bass Strait fields he said Bass Strait reserves are now two-thirds depleted with the three largest fields 80 pct depleted he said By 199293 Bass Strait output is expected to be just over half the 198586 level assuming a number of so far undeveloped fields are brought on stream and enhanced recovery from existing fields goes ahead Benbow said Government projections of output from as yet undiscovered fields range from 40000 to 130000 bpd he said Australian liquid fuel demand is forecast to rise to 680000 bpd in 199293 from 565000 in 198586 implying a crude oil gap of between 270000 and 360000 bpd in five years time he said At present world oil prices and the current value of the Australian dollar annual oil imports in 199293 would cost between 32 billion and 36 billion dlrs Benbow said Despite intensive exploration in the early 1980s the addition to reserves has been inadequate he said For example the 409 mln barrels discovered in the five years 1980-84 represent about two years consumption he said He called on the government to review its tax policies to restore incentive to exploration
8131	World governments should prepare for an inevitable significant increase in the price of oil as non-Middle East supplies diminish Exxon Corp ltXON director and senior vice-president Donald McIvor said Policymakers must also face up to the reality that the bulk of world oil reserves lies in the Middle East he said in a speech prepared for delivery to the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association APEA annual conference It appears ever more likely that new discoveries elsewhere will not change this fact he said McIvor said 37 of the worlds 30000 oil fields contain about 35 pct of all oil ever discovered Only 11 of these 37 super-giant fields lie outside the Middle East and only five of the 37 have been discovered in the last 20 years three of them in the Middle East he said He also said that since 1970 the world has been consuming 20 to 25 billion barrels a year while making discoveries at the rate of only 10 to 15 billion barrels a year More than half of remaining proved reserves are in the Middle East he said McIvor said it was important to continue to search for oil outside the Middle East because each addition contributes to a diversity of supply desirable for global political and economic stability It is important to enhance the likelihood of home-country discoveries with measures such as non-discriminatory and stable taxation and minimum regulation together with opening up of acreage for exploration he said Increasing reliance on the Middle East will also boost the incentive to use natural gas and synthetic sources of petroleum he added
8134	A 10 percentage point reduction in the Australian governments maximum crude oil levy on old oil would stabilize Bass Straits oil output resources analyst Ian Story said here A reduction to 70 pct from 80 pct would enable Bass Strait output to be maintained at the current rate of 420000 barrels per day BPD for the next year rather than falling to 380000 BPD in 198788 he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual conference Story is an analyst with and a director of Sydney stockbroker Meares and Philips Ltd Windfall profits taxes on Bass Strait crude are no longer appropriate in the current economic climate Story said The maximum 80 pct levy on old oil -- that discovered before September 1975 -- is now forcing the Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd ltBRKNSExxon Corp ltXON partnership to shut-in production accelerating the decline in output and reducing government revenue he said He said the producer return per barrel at a price of 30 Australian dlrs a barrel would rise to 207 dlrs from 080 dlrs if the levy was cut to 70 pct The economics at an 80 pct levy are simply not attractive at oil prices below 30 dlrs Story said Cutting the maximum levy rate to 70 pct would create higher levels of self-sufficiency increase government revenue boost exports and provide incentives for exploration and development he said The government is currently reviewing the oil tax structure

8210	The worlds dependency on the Mideast as the source for its petroleum is growing and nothing is going to stop it Donald K McIvor an Exxon Corp ltXON Director and senior vice president told Reuters in an interview Non-OPEC production will begin to decline and the gap between demand and supply will widen so that the trend to increasing dependence on OPEC and the Middle East is inevitable McIvor said Decreased supplies will firm prices for crude oil but are not likely to change a growing dependence McIvor said McIvor Exxons senior vice president responsible for oil and gas exploration and production said that dependence would result from the Mideasts large spare capacity at a time when the rest of the world consumes more oil than it was finding Since 1970 weve been consuming oil at rates of 20-25 billion barrels per year while making new discoveries of only about 10-15 bilion barrels per year McIvor said The bulk of the inventory and more than half of the remaining proved reserves lies in the middle east which is producing at much less than current capacity he added McIvor said that of the some 30000 oil fields discovered so far only 37 one-one thousandth of the total number contained about 35 pct of all the oil ever discovered McIvor said in response to a question that he did not believe there were any more super giants or oil fields with reserves greater than five billion barrels to be found which would change the conclusion of the worlds growing dependency Of those 37 super giants only 11 lie outside the Middle East Only five of the 37 have been discovered in the past 20 years and only two of these lie outside the middle east Cantarell in Mexico and Alaskas North Slope McIvor said McIvor said that many of the large fields outside the US like Alaskas Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea were reaching a peak and would soon begin to decline But the Exxon executive said that there were still plenty of opportunities to be explored and developed outside of the Middle east particulartly in Canada the North Sea and Australia and Africa McIvor said that decisions to explore and drill in those areas would be depedent upon both the expectations of a higher price of oil as well as the legal regime affecting the companies The ideal regime is a stable one not one where there is a constant change in policies McIvor said McIvor said he opposed import subsidies or tariffs used to increase exploration as these only benefit one part of the economy at the expense of other parts of the economy Asked about the options offered this week by US Energy Secretary Herrington to increase US production McIvor said he could not comment on subjects like the oil depletion allowance now but the thrust of his Herrington report is valid It has highlighted the growing dependency on the Middle east and the need to increase US production McIvor also said that he expected natural gas to play a greater role in the future in meeting energy needs Natural gas will have the opportunity to become an increasingly important part of the worlkds energy supply McIvor said Crude oil will be used more and more as a transportation fuel and natural gas will be used more to generate heat as an industrial fuel he added

8598	Australias crude oil tax strategy is probably best tackled in terms of a targeted rather than broadly-based approach Federal Resources and Energy Minister Gareth Evans told a meeting here He told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association APEA annual conference there was a prospect of developing a package that would recognise the governments economic priorities while also meeting some of the industrys concerns Evans was referring to a nearly completed government review of oil taxation Evans said there were plenty of examples where targeted approaches to oil industry taxation had produced good results in recent years These include the reduction in the top marginal crude excise rate on old Bass Strait oil found before September 1975 to 80 pct from 87 pct and the waiver of excise on onshore oil announced last September he said The industry through the APEA has been calling for the elimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boost incentives for prospecting against a background of weak prices and Australias relatively low exploration levels While nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity to an already complex taxation regime I am inclined to favour these kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes which leave government revenue much reduced and may still leave a lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies are going to do in major areas Evans said He said the government did not intend to change its resource rent taxation RRT legislation now before parliament in response to industry calls to allow all exploration expenditure in a given area to be deductible As previously reported RRT is a tax of 40 pct limited to highly prospective offshore areas based on profits after a certain rate of return has been achieved for individual projects APEA has said it is not a true profit-based tax because exploration deductibility is limited to successful projects Evans said the decision not to change RRT was based more than anything on the governments desire to ensure the certainty and stability of the new regime adding that major investments have already been planned on the existing ground rules

8623	The council of the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association APEA said it will press on with its campaign for major improvements to Australias petroleum taxation structure The council said in a statement the industry was bitterly disappointed by the Australian governments position on taxation as presented in a speech by Resources and Energy Minister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference As earlier reported Evans said he was inclined to target any tax changes rather than take a broad-based approach to secondary taxation of petroleum APEA had expected the government to make positive responses to detailed industry submissions seeking the removal of existing secondary tax disincentives to exploration and development the council said It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised by Evans but its immediate concern was the decision to proceed with the current resource rental tax RRT legislation Evans told the conference the government did not plan to accept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allow deductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure The governments unwillingness to allow the deduction of unsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshore area in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax is profit based the APEA council said The government missed a major opportunity to persuade oil exploration companies that it had realistic answers to the industrys concerns despite its recognition of the industrys problems the council said The industry has called for the end of all discriminatory secondary taxation of petroleum citing them as major disincentives at a time of low oil prices
8630	Leading Australian onshore oil and gas producer Santos Ltd ltSTOSS said its 1986 results were hit by sharp reductions in prices for crude oil condensate and liquefied petroleum gas LPG The Cooper Basin producer earlier reported a fall in net profit to 8867 mln dlrs from 14404 mln in 1985 Santos chairman Sir Brian Massy-Greene said in a statement that increased production particularly of oil and LPG along with reduced operating costs and reduced or deferred oil exploration and development outlays were helping Santos deal with an adverse business climate Santos said it remained financially strong with an injection of 84 mln dlrs from the second instalment of a 1985 rights issue and had cash reserves of 3813 mln dlrs at the end of 1986 against 4019 mln a year earlier It said it had also made significant progress in repaying debts and at year end the ratio of debt to shareholders funds had fallen to 101 from 154 Santos yesterday announced a 400 dlr a share takeover bid for the 9693 pct it did not already hold in oil and gas company ltTMOC Resources Ltd -- valuing the target at 2485 mln dlrs Santos said 75 pct of its loans were US Dollar denominated and significant currency purchases were made during the year to maintain that natural hedge At year end it held 145 mln US Dlrs enough to meet all 1987 repayments Santos said it had a successful gas exploration program finding 172 billion cubic feet in South Australia but oil exploration was less successful with 162 mln barrels added to reserves -- less than depletion during the year Cooper Basin producers are committed to a two-year scheme to double gas exploration while Santos said its 1987 budget for oil exploration had been boosted 20 pct Santos said the outlook for 1987 depended on prices and production volumes but with extra oil exploration and encouraging gas finds there were grounds for optimism But it called on the goverment to continue fostering domestic producers through the Import Parity Price scheme It makes no sense to abandon this policy now when exploration is at its lowest level for many years and when Australias oil self-sufficency is expected to decline rapidly Massy-Green said

8765	US Department of Energy Secretary John Herrington said he was optimistic about the chances of providing a more generous depletion allowance for oil and gas producers but added that the plan faces strong opposition from some members of the Reagan administration Herrington speaking to Houston oil executives at a breakfast meeting said administration debate over his plan for a 275 pct annual depletion allowance was heavy and strong largely because of some fears that the US oil industry could eventually become as dependent on federal subsidies as the agriculture industry Herringtons proposed tax incentives for the oil industry were issued last week after the Department of Energy released a comprehensive report finding US national security could be jeopardized by rising oil imports In response to a question from Mitchell Energy and Development Corp ltMND chairman George Mitchell Herrington said the report did not definitively rule out an oil import tarrif We intend to keep that debate open Herrington said However following his speech Herrington told Reuters that the new report shows an oil import fee is not economical Herrington said for example a 10 dlr per barrel tariff on oil imports would cause the nations gross national product to drop by as much as 32 billion dlrs Herrington also said he believed President Reagan who requested the comprehensive national security study was committed to some action to help the ailing US oil industry Im quite confident he understands the problems and is prepared to do something about it Herrington said
8815	A unanimous Supreme Court ruled that oil and gas exploration can proceed on two tracts off the Alaska coast which were leased by the federal government to eight major oil companies The ruling was an important victory for the oil companies and the Reagan administrations controversial off-shore leasing program and a setback for two small Alaskan villages that challenged the leases by claiming damage to the environment The administration said that the court-ordered halt in drilling had created uncertainty over the 42 billion dlrs paid for 621 leases off the shores of Alaska since December 1980 A federal appeals court ordered the oil companies to halt all exploration and remove all drilling rigs from two tracts in the Bering Sea off Alaska because of possible harm to the subsistence needs and culture of native Eskimos But the Supreme Court said the appeals court was wrong in issuing an injunction halting exploration Here injury to subsistence resources from exploration was not at all probable Justice Byron White wrote for the court And on the other side of the balance of harms was the fact that the oil companies had committed approximately 70 mln dlrs to exploration to be conducted during the summer of 1985 which they would have lost without chance of recovery had exploration been enjoined he said The oil companies Amoco Corp ltAN ARCO Exxon Corp ltXON Mobil Corp ltMOB Sohio Shell Texaco Inc ltTX and Union Oil had said that voiding previously granted leases would result in staggering financial losses The first lease sale in 1983 involved 24 mln acres and generated 318 mln dlrs while the second lease sale in 1984 covered 37 mln acres and produced 516 mln dlrs Administration officials saying the lease sales were preceded by an intense environmental impact study denied that the oil and gas exploration would hurt subsistence resources The Alaskan villages of Gambell and Stebbins along with an organization of Eskimo natives on the Yukon Delta argued that the drilling would hurt native hunting and fishing
8820	ltShell UK Ltds pre-tax profit on exploration and production operations fell to 869 mln stg in 1986 from 212 billion in 1985 due to the fall in oil prices last year Shell UK Finance director Nigel Haslam said But he told a press conference that due to the high marginal tax rate on North Sea operations the main impact of the drop in profit was absorbed by a fall in taxation to 330 mln stg from 145 billion in 1985 The bulk of tax last year was Corporation Tax with Petroleum Revenue Tax PRT representing only 16 mln stg he said As a result post-tax profit from the exploration and production sector fell by only 126 mln stg to 539 mln Earlier Shell UK a subsidiary of Royal DutchShell Group ltRDAS reported an overall net profit of 757 mln stg up from 667 mln in 1985 on sales of 657 billion stg against 881 mln Shell UK Chairman Bob Reid said the companys crude oil output from the North Sea was at a record 373000 bpd in 1986 which would almost certainly prove to be a peak for the company Shell expects a fall in output of around 10 pct in the current year to around 340000 bpd due mainly to the decline in output from the major Brent field he said Gas output of 59 billion cubic metres and natural gas liquids output of around one mln tonnes in 1986 are expected to be maintained in 1987 he said A final decision on development of the Kittiwake and Osprey North Sea oil fields will be made in the next 12 to 18 months Reid said The Kittiwake field originally part of the 25 billion stg Gannet project abandoned last year when the oil price fell is now estimated to cost around 350 mln stg Economies on development costs for the Tern and Eider North Sea fields which were approved last year have brought the cost down to 30 to 35 pct below the original budget Day to day operating costs of the exploration and production sector had been cut 10 pct last year and the target is to keep costs per barrel constant The company drilled 17 wells offshore with 10 leading to the discovery of hydrocarbons although it is too early to gauge the commercial viability of these discoveries Reid said Restructuring of the downstream oil sector contributed to a profit rise to 187 mln stg in 1986 from 91 mln stg in 1985 Jaap Klootwijk managing director of downstream unit ltShell UK Oil said refining margins in the first quarter of 1987 were a bit better than the very bad fourth quarter 1986 In November and December in particular refining operations had shown negative margins following the fall in crude and oil product prices he said He expected margins to continue generally positive over the summer although they could dip to become negative from time to time depending on price movements A new catalytic cracker at Shells Stanlow refinery will now come on stream by the end of first quarter 1988 about five months behind schedule following a crane accident which severely damaged the plant last year he said Profits from the chemicals sector rose to 33 mln stg from 11 mln after the rationalisation of the Carrington chemical site Haslam said the Budget announcement on PRT relief by which companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying development expenditure on certain future oil fields against PRT was helpful but rather less than had been hoped for Reid said his estimate of crude oil prices this year was in the range of 15 to 18 dlrs If prices went much above that he would expect some over-production above OPECs official 158 mln bpd output ceiling which would tend to bring prices back down He said it looked as if the December OPEC pact to restrain output was holding bringing supply and demand into balance but the test will come in summer when demand for OPEC oil will fall
8835	A House taxwriter said Energy Secretary James Herringtons outrageous plan to restore an old tax break for oil companies was both bad tax and energy policy Rep Pete Stark a California Democrat and senior House Ways and Means Committee member said Herringtons plan for a 275 pct depletion allowance--which in effect is a special 275 pct tax deduction --would cost seven billion dlrs a year He must have missed the last two years of federal tax reform by sleeping as soundly as Rip Van Winkle Stark said He said in a statement the oil industry already pays an effective lower rate of US tax on investment 15 pct versus aggregate corporate tax on all investment of 34 pct according to a recent Congressional Research Service study

9253	Papua New Guinea PNG provides the most exciting new prospect in the Asia-Pacific region for oil production energy analyst Fereidun Fesharaki said here The recent successful find at Iagifu is likely to put PNG on the list of major oil exporters by the early 1990s he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual conference Fesharaki leader of the Energy Program at the East-West Center in Honolulu Hawaii was speaking on the Asia-Pacific petroleum outlook With domestic demand of around 12000 barrels per day bpd and prospects of production of over 100000 bpd by late 1991 PNG would become an Ecuador-level crude exporter Fesharaki said The Iagifu wells in the Papuan Basin have recorded the best oil flows in more than 60 years of exploration in PNG The PNG governments Geological Survey in a paper distributed at the conference estimates Iagifu reserves at about 500 mln barrels PNG enjoys the most liberal tax regime in the region with no secondary taxes Fesharaki said We expect a much larger oil search in Papua New Guinea and discovery of much larger volumes of oil similar in quality to light Bass Strait crude Fesharaki said There are also large pockets of high quality condensates to be produced notably in the Juha field near Iagifu which is capable of producing 30000 to 40000 bpd he said But prices should be somewhat higher than the present levels to justify development of the Juha field he said The PNG Geological Survey paper noted there are five large prospective but little-explored sedimentary basins in PNG

9293	British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher denied in an interview published in Saudi Arabia today that her governments oil policy contributed to weakness in world oil prices She said the government was determined not to intervene to influence production decisions by oil companies operating in the North Sea We believe these must be a matter for the commercial judgment of the oil companies she told the Arabic language daily al-Sharq al-Awsat in an interview coinciding with a visit to London by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia Thatcher said this policy had not contributed to the fall in oil prices as North Sea production was now about the same as in 1984 when prices were close to 30 dlrs a barrel British production was on a plateau and was unlikely to increase in the future she said We naturally share the concern of Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members about the harmful effects of oil market volatility for both producer and consumer countries Thatcher said On our part we are careful to avoid any actions which might add to such volatility
9436	Energy Secretary John Herrington has proposed several ways to boost US oil production but he said all would cost the Treasury money and will come under close White House scrutiny before action is taken One measure he said he favored would raise the depletion allowance to 275 pct on new oil and gas production as well as production using enhanced extraction methods Herrington said such a plan would cost 200 mln dlrs a year The White House reacting said it did not favor amending the tax code but would look at the proposal Herringtons proposals to spur production were made along with the release last week of the energy departments report on energy and the national security The report said US oil imports rapidly rising could hit 50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damaging implications for national security He has said since in speeches and at news conferences that any plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil production would have to meet three criteria--increase production not cause economic dislocation and be low cost to the taxpayer Herrington said an import fee would meet the first test spurring production but fail the second and third He said it would raise production and return 120000 oil workers to their jobs but at the same time it lifted oil prices the higher prices would cost 400000 jobs nationwide and cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs A tax on gasoline he said would fail the first criteria by not increasing domestic production In any case US officials say President Reagan remains firmly opposed to an import fee and a gasoline tax Options which meet Herringtons criteria include - Loan-price guarantees to shield banks from defaults by borrowers because of lower oil prices It was estimated that if oil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults that could cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs - A five pct tax credit for exploration and development It would raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325000 barrels a day at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year - A five pct credit only for geological and geophysical expenditures It would increase production by 80000 barrels a day at a cost of 65 mln dlrs - Lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage to spur exploration A drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre for the typical 5760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lower the cost of the standard tract lease to 144000 dlrs Herrington also pressed anew for existing Administration proposals to deregulate natural gas which he said would cut the need for imported oil by 300000 barrels daily He also called again for Congressional approval to explore off the continental shelf which may hold more than 12 billion barrels of oil and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge which may hold nine billion barrels Herrington said he understood the Reagans reluctance to amend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of these proposals but added he hoped his departments energysecurity study would make a strong case for the need to help the struggling domestic oil industry Another move Herrington said he will press anew even though it had been rejected earlier by the White House is to raise the fill-rate for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to 100000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35000 This he said would further bolster national security in case of an oil-supply disruption
9445	Canadas federal government will provide a 350 mln dlr oil industry aid package that includes cash incentives designed to cover one-third of a companys oil and gas exploration and development costs Energy Minister Marcel Masse announced The aid program will inject about 350 mln dlrs a year into the oil and gas industry and could lead to more than one billion dlrs in new investment Masse told a news conference The program will affect drilling done anywhere in Canada on or after April 1 1987 Masse told reporters that the governments oil industry aid package is aimed at small and medium sized companies The aid package called the Canadian Exploration and Development Incentive Program will restrict the total payments that any individual company can claim to 10 mln dlrs a year Masse said the program will probably generate new employment equivalent to 20000 people working for a year He said oil industry aid is needed because exploration and development spending dropped by at least 50 pct since world oil prices fell during the first half of 1986 Energy Minister Masse said the federal government decided to provide cash incentives so a large number of non-tax paying companies mainly small Canadian firms will receive the full value of the incentive Such companies would not immediately benefit from tax benefits he said The federal government also wanted to deliver an aid program outside the tax system Finance Minister Michael Wilson is now reviewing Canadas tax system and plans to announce tax reform proposals later this spring An important feature of the aid program is a decision to let companies issue flow-through shares allowing investors to benefit from the subsidy rather than restricting benefits to only participating companies he said Allowing flow-through shares under the program will make it easier for companies to attract investors in exploration and development Masse said He told reporters his department is still considering whether to allow partnerships and other entities to qualify for the subsidy
