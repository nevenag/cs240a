6515	Silver looks unlikely to break out of gold and platinums shadow in the near future although this year is likely to see demand increasing at a faster rate than supply a study by Credit Suisse said The study predicted demand rising by 300 tonnes to 13200 tonnes this year against a 50 tonne increase in supply to 14050 tonnes This should cut the global oversupply to 850 tonnes from last years provisional 1100 tonnes The study noted that the effects of last years lower prices were having a dampening effect on total supply which was now back down to around levels of a decade ago However the study said that primary production likely to reach 10000 tonnes this year against a provisional 9950 in 1986 is relatively insensitive to price falls Around a third of silver production comes from heavily indebted Mexico and Peru Price-sensitivity is also reduced by the fact that the majority of silver is a by-product of other mining activity
