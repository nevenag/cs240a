10344	Recent slackness on Dutch capital markets has led some bankers to question the Central Banks policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the West German mark and to ask for more flexiblility in exchange rate policy While agreeing with the Banks commitment to defend the guilder strongly some bankers want the Bank to make more use of the range within which the guilder and the mark can fluctuate against each other in the European Monetary System EMS Roelof Nelissen chairman of Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV Amro said the Central Banks policy was overcautious I would like to suggest that the Bank use more freely the range given to the guilder in the EMS Nelissen said at the presentation of Amros 1986 annual report last week Within the EMS the mark is allowed to fluctuate against the guilder between 1101675 and 115235 guilders per 100 The Central Bank maintains a stricter policy and tries to keep the mark below the 11300 guilders per 100 It regards a stable exchange rate as its main target using interest rate policies to influence the exchange rate The preference of exchange rate goals above interest rate aims goes almost undisputed in the Netherlands Critics say the Bank keeps the reins unnecessarily short Rabobank Nederland said in its latest economic bulletin By maintaining the 11300 limit the Central Bank raises the expectation it will always intervene above that level If it suddenly needs more flexibility it will find it very hard to obtain Amros Nelissen said relatively small changes in interest rates and exchange rates could cause substantial flows of securities business and sharp fluctuations on the Dutch capital market Large interest rate changes were often needed to bring about small changes in the guildermark exchange rate he added Unlike Amro Algemene Bank Nederland NV ABN says this is a price the Dutch have to pay It fully agrees with the Central Banks policy director-general Julien Geertsema told Reuters noting a 1983 decision not to revalue the guilder fully with the mark in the EMS hurt confidence in the Dutch currency It is a pity we need such a wide interest rate difference between West Germany to maintain the exchange rate he added Interest rate differentials between West Germany and the Netherlands are the main factors that trigger capital flows between the two countries as the economic performance of the two does not differ much economists said Data on 1986 capital flows between West Germany and the Netherlands have not yet been released but in 1985 they accounted for only 10 pct of total trade flows between the two countries put at 110 billion guilders for 1986 by the Dutch-German Chamber of Commerce earlier this month Economists say capital flows are more sensitive to interest and exchange rates West Germany is the Netherlands largest single trading partner taking 28 pct of Dutch exports and providing 26 pct of imports in the last quarter of 1986 Central Bureau of Statistics figures show At the moment the rates for three month euromark deposits trade around 40 pct while the same deposits in guilders have a rate of around 5-716 pct Amro bank argues that the Dutch real interest rate will even rise further because of expectations of deflation here in 1987 contrasting with slight inflation in West Germany In the Netherlands the cost of living is expected to decrease by 15 pct at a GNP growth rate of two pct the Dutch Central Planning Agency said in its 1987 forecast last month German GNP is seen rising by two to 25 pct but with inflation between zero and 10 pct according to most German forecasts But despite this upward push on real Dutch rates money dealers do not expect the Central Bank to cut official rates independently without prior moves by the Bundesbank Following the West German interest rate cuts on January 22 the Dutch Central Bank did not lower its rates but set a 05 pct lower tariff for special advances and abandoned its credit surcharge Most traders were surprised by this move as they had expected the Bank to follow suit unconditionally they said The Bank said it lowered the rate with the largest impact on the money market as far as the exchange rate permitted While not entirely unsympathetic to critics of its policies the Central Bank keeps its grip firm and the range narrow The European Monetary System is not only a relationship between the guilder and the mark Many times widening of the margin between the two would implicate we have to buy or sell large amounts of a third currency Central Bank vice-director Jan-Hendrik Du Marchie Sarvaas said If we allowed the guilder to become a little cheaper the markets would start to believe it was weak We dont want that We want to make clear that the guilder is just as strong as the mark he said
3024	Dutch economic growth is slowing as a firming guilder cuts competitiveness abroad and industries reduce the pace of investment the Dutch official planning agency CPB said The Centraal Planbureau publishing its 1987 economic outlook said Dutch Net National Income NNI was expected to grow by one pct this year down from two pct growth recorded in 1986 and 25 pct in 1985 and 1984 Dutch Gross National Product is expected to rise to 43220 billion guilders in 1987 in constant prices a two pct increase from last years 42395 billion The CPB forecasting an 85 pct increase in the value of the guilder on a trade-weighted basis compared with 100 pct last year said the dollar was expected to trade at an average of 20 guilders in 1987 compared with 245 guilders in 1986 The higher guilder is causing a substantial fall in unit labour costs abroad when measured in guilder terms while these are rising slightly in the Netherlands the CPB said More of economic growth now depended on domestic consumption the CPB said but noting that higher margins set by domestic producers and importers mitigated the effect on purchasing power of lower import costs and deflation Consumer prices were set to fall by 15 pct this year the CPB said Inflation was zero last year Gross investment in industry was expected to grow by five pct this year a slowdown compared with 115 pct growth last year the CPB said Exchange rate and oil price fluctuations will continue to condition the Dutch economy in the future as it has in recent years the CPB said noting a continued depressing impact of these factors on Dutch competitiveness In addition it noted a slight rise in taxation and social security costs to employers The CPB forecasting a rise in the budget deficit to 72 pct of Net National Income in 1987 from 63 pct last year urged the government to cut expenditure further to bring down the deficit and reduce tax and social security payments in future Dutch government revenue is being depressed further by falling income from natural gas sales in 1987 the CPB said It said unemployment was expected to fall to 675000 this year from 710000 last year While the two pct GDP growth forecast set by the CPB is within its latest forecast issued last month of 15 to two pct growth the figure is well above recent market estimates Dutch merchant bank Pierson Heldring en Pierson said in its February economic outlook that GDP growth at constant prices was expected to be 11 pct this year and market analysts had expected the CPBs final forecast to be below its own latest estimate It is too early to comment because I havent seen the whole document yet but it would seem we are more pessimistic in some of our estimates a Pierson economist said The CPB forecast 25 pct export growth in volume terms in 1987 after four pct growth last year Excluding energy exports the 1987 figure would be two pct it said Imports were set to rise by 45 pct this year compared with four pct in 1986 in volume terms the CPB said The balance of payments would see a sharp decline in the surplus to six billion guilders in 1987 compared with 121 billion last year the CPB forecast
