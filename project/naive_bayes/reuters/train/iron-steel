7161	European Community EC industry ministers today declared there is a need for a massive round of closures of steel plants to bring capacity in the 12-country bloc into reasonable balance with demand The ministers were meeting to discuss a plan for voluntary plant closures drawn up by the industry lobby group Eurofer which it calculates would cost around 22000 jobs Diplomats said that in their initial reactions to the scheme most ministers declared it was a useful basis for discussion but did not go nearly far enough Eurofer says it has identified scope for the closure of plants which have an annual capacity of 1526 mln tonnes provided the companies concerned can be fully repaid by the EC or national governments for redundancy and other social costs But EC Executive Commission sources said Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes told ministers today that 30 mln tonnes of annual capacity was excess to requirements and should be closed by the end of 1990 He said the Eurofer plan in particular fails to pinpoint the scope for closure in heavy hot-rolled wide-strip products typically produced in plants employing thousands of people The sources said no minister challenged Narjes analysis that four or five hot-rolled wide-strip lines would have to close They said ministers agreed that the Eurofer plan should be expanded and developed through meetings among the industry body the Commission and representatives of member states However diplomats said it was clear from todays discussions that such meetings will be difficult They said member states are split on whether to reduce the scope of a quota production system which at present protects EC steelmakers from the full force of competition for 65 pct of their products while talks on the closure plan proceed It was also clear that there will be tough talks on which EC member states should bear the brunt of the closures and on how much funding for help to those thrown out of work should come from Community coffers German minister Martin Bangemann said his countrys steel industry the largest in the EC should not suffer proportionately more than others German sources said But British diplomats said their minister Giles Shaw insists that the profitability of companies should be taken into account The state owned British Steel Corporation benefitting from massive recent write-offs of its accumulated debts is currently one of the few EC steel companies in the black Ministers were this afternoon trying to agree a joint statement on the Eurofer plan and the situation in the industry
7323	European Community EC industry ministers agreed on a plan for voluntary steel plant closures drawn up by industry lobby group Eurofer and calculated to lead to the loss of about 22000 jobs The ministers resolved that the proposed closures which should bring production capacity more in line with weak demand remain considerably below the surplus in capacity They asked the EC Executive Commission to consult with Eurofer major steel companies and with governments to pinpoint scope for further capacity reductions beyond the annual 1526 mln tonnes identified by Eurofer The Commission will draw up a new system  of steel production quotas to protect vulnerable EC firms from the full rigors of open competition Commission sources said any new system would cover only heavy products representing about 45 pct of the market instead of 65 pct under the present system Ministers hope to approve a closure program when they meet again in Brussels on June 1 the sources said Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes told ministers capacity was 30 mln tonnes in excess of requirements and that this excess ought to be eliminated by the end of 1990
