11000	UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the meeting of six major industrial nations in Paris last month agreed not to publish any bands in connection with their pact to stabilise currencies Questioned by a parliamentary select committee about why the participating countries had not announced any bands Lawson replied we all agreed it would be much more sensible not to When asked whether that meant an informal joint currency float with set ranges was arranged in Paris Lawson said I do not want to reveal the precise nature of the agreement so as not to make it easy for speculation against the accord Lawson said the Paris accord presumed that individual countries would take corrective action if their currency began reacting significantly to domestic macroeconomic factors But if such movements were due to extraneous factors Lawson said the other pact countries would come to its aid through concerted intervention on the foreign exchanges It is clear that both Germany and Japan are having difficulty adjusting to their very large exchange rate appreciations and making their economies more domestically oriented just as it is taking time for the United States to make its own economy more export oriented Lawson said In his oral evidence to Parliaments Select Treasury Committee Lawson repeated that he was happy with the pounds current level adding that It is an objective  To try to keep it around that level He said the perception of sterling on foreign exchanges had changed since the steep drop in oil prices largely because the pound had weathered that period so successfully There has been a reassessment of sterlings fundamentals Lawson said  He disagreed with what he termed the grossly exaggerated claim that real UK Interest rates were much higher than those of other major industrialsed countries Using as a reference the key three-month sterling interbank rate as quoted in London Lawson said Britain now had a real interest rate level of 575 pct - the same as Japan did and only a 075 percentaage point above the Group of Five average Lawson confirmed that over the medium and longer term the governments objective is zero inflation He said the governments intention of its PSBR constant at 10 pct of GDP is the modern equivalent of the balanced budget doctrine  He added that to allow the debtGDP ratio to remain constant on anything other than zero inflation basis is simply a recipe for accelerating inflation

12121	UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said he wanted sterling to stay roughly where it was specifying a rate of around 290 marks and 160 dlrs He told the National Economic Development Council that the recent Paris meeting of major industrialised nations had agreed on the need for exchange rate stability There was now a reasonable alignment of currencies and the UK Government intended to keep sterling at about its present level he said That meant around 290 marks which is the single most important rate to concentrate on and 160 dlrs Lawson said His disclosure of two of the key targets for sterling was highly unusual foreign exchange market analysts said In the past he has preferred to be less definite about the Governments exchange rate policy lest it give foreign exchange markets set limits to test Lawson told the committee which is a tripartite forum of government unions and industry that the pound would be kept near its present level by a mixture of interest rates and intervention in the foreign exchange markets The pound finished trading here today at 1604050 dlrs and 2921045 marks His disclosure of two of the key targets for sterling was highly unusual foreign exchange market analysts said In the past he has preferred to be less definite about the Governments exchange rate policy lest it give foreign exchange markets set limits to test Lawson told the committee which is a tripartite forum of government unions and industry that the pound would be kept near its present level by a mixture of interest rates and intervention in the foreign exchange markets The pound finished trading here today at 1604050 dlrs and 2921045 marks
12406	Money market rates rates showed a harder edge after news UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson has set a target for the pound against the mark and dollar to be maintained by a mixture of interest rates and intervention in the foreign exchange markets Dealers said the market was surprised by the Chancellors disclosure of sterling target rates around 290 marks and 160 dlrs and nervous over the implications for domestic interest rates further reducing the propects for a near term cut in UK Bank base rates The key three months interbank sterling rate gained 116 point at 10 9-78 pct The pound opened three basis points lower at 713 in trade weighted terms at around 159 dlrs and 291 marks
12418	Interest rates on the London money market were slightly firmer on news UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson had stated target rates for sterling against the dollar and mark dealers said They said this had come as a surprise and expected the targets 290 marks and 160 dlrs to be promptly tested in the foreign exchange markets Sterling opened 03 points lower in trade weighted terms at 713 Dealers noted the chancellor said he would achieve his goals on sterling by a combination of intervention in currency markets and interest rates Operators feel the foreign exchanges are likely to test sterling on the downside and that this seems to make a fall in UK Base lending rates even less likely in the near term dealers said The feeling remains in the market however that fundamental factors have not really changed and that a rise in UK Interest rates is not very likely The market is expected to continue at around these levels reflecting the current 10 pct base rate level for some time The key three months interbank rate was 116 point firmer at 10 9-78 pct 
12447	Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawsons remarks yesterday suggesting there are precise exchange rate targets for the pound undermined sterling dashing hopes for an early cut in UK Base rates analysts said But the markets reaction testing exchange rate levels indicated by Lawson was probably overdone and the longer term outlook for sterling remained bullish they agreed In an apparent break with the previous policy of secrecy Lawson told a National Economic Development Council meeting he was comfortable with sterling exchange rates around current levels specifying rates of around 190 marks and 160 dlrs Lawson added the UK Government intended to keep sterling at about present levels using currency intervention and interest rates to achieve this The February 22 Paris agreement of the Group of Five and Canada to stabilise exchange rates is widely believed to include target ranges but all participants to the meeting had so far refused to specify these Markets were quick to react to the statement chopping about one US Cent and over one pfennig off the pound to match the levels mentioned by Lawson But most analysts polled said they did not believe Lawsons statement signalled a change in UK Policy Keith Skeoch chief economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co said the remarks have been blown out of proportion Lawson is paying now for a little bit of a slip of the tongue Barclays de Zoete Wedd economist Mark Brett said there is nothing great and fantastic in the Chancellors statement He said he did not believe the rates indicated by the Chancellor were precise targets but merely represented central rates around which sterling would be allowed to fluctuate perhaps by as much as 10 pct It would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of an election  I dont believe Lawson is mad enough to tie himself to a fixed rate Brett said Currency markets were keen for official statements to clarify the scope of the Paris accord and reactivate currency trading This mood easily led to over-reaction analysts said Making similar statements when the market is high strung and ready to bounce is perhaps a mistake one senior dealer with a US Bank said Capels Skeoch said it gives the foreign exchange markets something to shoot at It is obvious that the government as a member of the Group of Six has agreed exchange rate bands But they are not cut in stone they can change with time Skeoch said Brett said we think the 290 marks level is a central rate Give or take 10 pfennigs and all is fine Not all analysts played down the significance of the remarks however Chris Dunn economist at Royal Bank of Canada said the remarks may signal a decisive move to insulate sterling from the fortunes of the dollar Although about two-thirds of Britains trade is conducted with European countries sterling has traditionally shadowed the dollar rather than the mark analysts noted Britain must decide whether it wants to follow the US Or throw in its lot with Europe Dunn said It suggests that while the UK Is not actually applying to join the European Monetary System it is seeking protection by shadowing it  The Bundesbank has made it clear that it wants the UK To clarify its position relative to the mark he said Analysts said sterlings dip on currency markets following Lawsons remarks made an early half-point cut in UK Base rates from current 10 pct levels unlikely in the short term Over the next three weeks a cut is out unless we get some extremely good economic indicators Capels Skeoch said Base rates have been cut twice by one-half point in March the last after the March 17 budget presentation and analysts had been expecting another half point cut shortly afterwards
14767	News of an agreement among G-5 and G-7 finance ministers meeting in Washington this week will be key to the direction of currency futures at the International Monetary Market but any such agreement will need to go beyond the Paris accord to stem the recent rise in futures financial analysts said If they the finance ministers give the market something really new to look at -- that is some package that goes beyond the Paris agreement -- you could have a real boost in the dollar said Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Anne Mills On the other hand anything neutral would tend to be bearish for the dollar Mills said Traders and analysts agree a simple reaffirmation of the Paris accord will not be enough to halt the decline in the dollar nor will central bank intervention A lot of people are looking for a reason to buy currencies and sell the dollar said one trader for a large retail firm on the floor of the IMM If there is no concrete resolution they will be looking to sell the dollar possibly down to the 180 mark level he said Technically most currency futures are poised for another rise said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane Sloane noted that June yen futures set a new contract high on Tuesday and closed at its best level ever while June sterling set a new contract high on Monday Everything seems to be coming to a head right now and you dont need much to get things rolling Sloane said In particular the June Canadian dollar for which Sloane recently put out a buy recommendation has hovered in a range between 07600 and 07660 in recent weeks forming a triangle on the charts from which it may soon break out on the upside A close above the contract high of 07665 would signal a breakout Sloane said and would likely mean the nearby Canadian dollar contract would extend its advance to near the 07800 level June Canadian dollar closed at 07656 Tuesday Mills noted however that interest rate differentials between Canadian securities and US securities have narrowed dramatically recently with yields on 10-year Canadian bonds only about 80 basis points above US 10-year notes What has helped the Canadian currency she noted is an increasing proportion of foreign funds flowing into the Canadian equity market particularly from Japanese investors Other analysts however said currency futures may be near the top of their long-term rally Something will be done at the G-5 and G-7 meeting to calm people said David Horner of Merrill Lynch Economics The Paris accord has pretty much fixed where major European currencies will trade Horner said But sterling futures may still make another run for new highs up to 16300 to 16500 dlr in the June contract on the positive atmosphere that will prevail before British elections and possibly another interest rate cut Horner said The June British pound closed at 16080 on Tuesday Horner said that new boundaries for the trading range of the yen are likely to come out of the G-5 and G-7 meetings The most likely range will be a bottom for the dollar between 140 to 142 yen per dollar and a top near 150 to 152 yen Horner said In yen futures the bottom of the dollars range would be equivalent to 0007100 to 0007150 in the June contract June yen closed at 0006913 on Tuesday If such a range does emerge from the meetings we will have one more rally in the yen Horner said
3283	Two new eurosterling bonds were launched today making a total of 10 new deals in the sector so far this month as borrowers rush to cash in on a bull sterling market fueled by the strength of the pound and pre-budget euphoria The Bank of England finally gave way to a 12 point cut in banks base lending rates earlier today but dealers said this had been largely discounted and was not likely to detract from the current popularity of sterling-denominated investments Sterling in any shape or form is flavor of the month and were set to see many more eurosterling deals one dealer said Todays new eurosterling bonds were a 10-year 100 mln stg deal for Sweden at 9-12 pct and priced at 101-14 pct lead by Baring Brothers and Co Ltd and a 14 year 60 mln stg convertible deal for Storehouse Plc launched by SBCI International Ltd We thought we saw a proverbial flood of new deals with the 14 we had last month but it seems March will beat February hands down with 10 already one eurosterling specialist said Optically psychologically these single figures are much more attractive for the borrower Eurosterling looks like a cheap and attractive way to raise your money he added This accounts for the wide variety of borrowers who have tapped the sector recently ranging from sovereigns such as the Kingdom of Sweden today continental banks including Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank and British corporations Another UK Merchant bank analyst noted that the current vogue for eurosterling enabled several corporate borrowers last month to offer paper priced below comparative gilt yields A Storehouse official confirmed that the issue was aimed at Swiss and German investors who were showing good interest This is the first entry into the long term international capital markets by Storehouse British designer Terence Conrans retail conglomerate which incorporates UK Chain stores Mothercare British Home Stores and Habitat We have been considering the move for quite some time now and the current strength of the eurosterling sector provided the perfect opportunity and spur for us to finally tap the market Lance Moir corporate treasurer at Storehouse Plc told Reuters 
3535	Interest in the currency futures market has shifted to the soaring British pound and the potentially explosive Canadian dollar and away from the dull Continental and Japanese currencies analysts said The June pound which added 63 cents over the past week-and-a-half to reach a new contract high of 15930 to the dollar on Monday has spawned a new-found speculative boom Brokers have to push their clients somewhereand technically the pound is in the best shape PaineWebber analyst Jason Gillard said Weve tried to take a bullish approach to the pound and were going to stay with that theres no reason to change Smith Barney analyst Craig Sloane said Many traders took on long poundshort West German mark futures positions although some of those cross-trades were liquidated yesterday Sloane said The fundamental keys to the pounds rise have been relatively high UK interest rates and a vague optimism surrounding the British economy analysts said Money seems to be chasing yields William Byers of Bear Stearns said of the 10-12 pct UK base lending rate Many analysts are skeptical about further gains in the pound on the inference that the Bank of England will seek to relieve upward pressure on the currency by pushing down interest rates after the nations budget is released March 17 The budget itself could have an impact depending on how well it is received but analysts say relative interest rates and oil income remain the main influences on the currency However the market may be able to absorb lower UK interest rates as it has done when other countries have cut their discount rates and extend the pounds rally Sloane said The Canadian dollar has not been rising like the pound but Sloane and other analysts cautiously predicted a big move soon The sideways price pattern in the June contract with smaller and smaller price ranges has formed a bull flag on price charts technically-oriented analysts said It makes for an explosive type of situation that often leads to a breakout in this case to the upside Sloane said Byers agreed there was potential for the June Canadian dollar to rally above the 7700 cent level from the most recent close at 7480 cents to the US dollar At this stage of the game Id call the market long-term positive but for the technical burden of proof you need a close above the previous contract high of 7525 Byers said As to the traditionally more active currencies stability was the catchword and reluctance the watchword among analysts Sloane said it was important that June Swiss francs and June German marks held above support at 06400 and 05400 respectively closing at 06438 and 05430 Yesterdays rebound showed the market was still very respectful of the Paris accord and the threat of central bank intervention by the G-5 nations plus Canada We may still probe to see what the parameters are Byers said but people are very reluctant because they dont know where the central banks will be to intervene Gillard said the mark could drop to a previous price consolidation area around 05250 based on the profoundly sluggish West German economy but that he would be a buyer at that level
3666	Foreign exchange market rumours that the the Bank of England has been selling sterling to halt its rise prompted a wary response from dealers who said they saw no obvious confirmation market sources said Bank of England officials were not immediately available for comment Earlier this week the Bank sanctioned a cut in bank interest rates in a surprise move which aimed at limiting sterlings rise ahead of the March 17 budget But today the pound has strengthened to 727 on its trade-weighted index from 721 last night though the UK Currency is below its days high against the dollar
7429	UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel today repeated that he was satisfied with the current level of sterling both against the dollar and the West German mark Lawson said in a television interview that he did not regard the pounds present exchange rate was uncomfortably high I think it is round about right he said I think there was a time that they British manufacturers thought the exchange rate was uncomfortably high But I think they are very satisfied with the present level But I have made it absolutely clear that I dont want to see the pound go through the roof he added
8884	The move by foreign exchange markets to test the strength of the Paris currency accord has thrown into question the near-term outlook for sterling until recently one of the main beneficiaries of the agreement analysts said Since the six-nation accord last month sterling has risen sharply adding almost five pct on its trade-weighted index While the accord effectively stifled dollaryen and dollarmark movements the markets turned their attention to sterling as foreign investors rushed to take advantage of relatively high UK Interest rates But analysts say the pound has been sidelined by the first tentative test of the Paris accord seen yesterday The market now looks set sooner or later to push the dollar down further in a test of the willingness of central banks to intervene Analysts say if the banks do not intervene effectively the Paris accord could collapse On balance sterling would be a net sufferer if G-6 collapses Phillips and Drew analyst Stephen Lewis said He said sterling would lose out as markets turned their attention to capital movements whereas previously they had been restricted to looking only at the interest yield on currencies However although most analysts and foreign exchange dealers were forecasting a brief period of consolidation or even retracement for sterling none were expecting a very sharp drop in the UK Currency Sterling remained supported by optimism on the UK Political and economic outlook firmer oil prices and relatively high interest rates they said Bullish sentiment on the UK Economic outlook has been running especially high after last weeks budget seen as popular both with the markets and with British voters Sterling was also supported by signs of a weakening in the West German and Japanese economies where growth for 1987 is trailing behind the three pct forecast for the UK Recent opinion polls showing Britains ruling conservative party ahead of opposition parties in popularity have also supported the pound In addition sterling has so far shrugged off two half-point cuts in UK Bank base lending rates in less than two weeks A further half-point cut widely expected in the next week or so has already been largely discounted UK Base rates now running at 10 pct are still relatively high compared to other western countries and analysts said a further base rate cut to 9-12 pct was unlikely to affect sterling Sterling today appeared resilient to the dollars decline dropping only slightly on a cross-rate basis Worries about renewed turbulence in the foreign exchange markets however were reflected in the UK Government bond gilt market where prices dropped by up to 516 point Until now foreign investor interest in the gilt market has been one of the major reasons behind the rise in sterling Dealers said they expected the pound to hold quietly steady for the next few days while the market awaits further developments on the dollar and this Thursdays UK Current account figures for February Market forecasts are for a deficit of around 250 mln stg after Januarys small surplus
9848	The release of UK February trade data showing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376 mln stg up from a 73 mln surplus in January has boosted hopes of an early cut in interest rates analysts said Market forecasts had been for a worse outcome with expectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750 mln stg against the official figure of 224 mln stg sharply narrower than Januarys 527 mln deficit The figures are unreservedly good Chase Manhattan Securities economist Andrew Wroblewski said Sterling rebounded on the trade figures reversing a weaker morning trend to stand at 721 pct of its trade weighted index against a basket of currencies at midday unchanged from yesterdays close but 03 points above the 1100 GMT level The market had feared that a deteriorating non-oil trade pattern would undermine international support for sterling which has been the motor behind the recent fall in UK Interest rates Money market sources said the market had begun to doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates to 95 pct from the present 100 pct was really on the cards But sentiment now looks to have turned about again There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawsons forecast of a 1987 current account deficit of 25 billion stg will be exceeded said Wroblewski Seasonally adjusted figures showed that imports rose in February to 716 billion stg from 673 billion in January Exports rose to a record 693 billion from 620 billion However Chris Tinker UK Analyst at brokers Phillips and Drew said that the faster rise in exports than imports would prove partly aberrational in coming months He forecast the Chancellors Budget tax cuts would increase consumer expediture on imported goods However Ian Harwood economist at Warburg Securities said his firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit forecast in the light of the latest data cutting one billion stg off the expected full year total to about 175 billion stg He said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the Confederation of British Industry The growth in imports appears to be flattening even if Januarys bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas goods and import-intensive stock building among manufactureres Harwood said UK Government bonds or gilts surged by more than 12 point on the better-than-expected news as earlier worries about the figures evaporated Sterling peaked at a high of 16075 dlrs before settling to a steady 16050 dlrs about 1300 GMT nearly a cent higher than the European low of 15960 However analysts noted that the turnabout in market sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the Conservative governments support was slipping The Marplan poll published in Today showed Conservative support had fallen to 36 pct from 38 pct last month while the Alliance of Liberals and Social Democrats had rallied to 31 pct from 21 pct to run neck and neck with the Labour Party whose own support fell from 38 pct The poll was taken after the Budget which was greeted enthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have left the voters indifferent political observers said Another regular poll is due tomorrow and eonomists warn that todays improved sentiment could be dented if support for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher slips again This upsetting of the markets political perceptions which are all but discounting a Conservative victory in the upcoming general election made them more sensitive to the trade data Harwood said The news did come as a very very substantial relief he said However on the interest rate front economists caution that Lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable by encouraging another base rate fall They noted Lawson had already got an inflation-reducing cut in mortgage rates in response to lower base rates so domestic political reasons for lower rates have been curtailed
