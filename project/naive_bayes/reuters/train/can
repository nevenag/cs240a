14767	News of an agreement among G-5 and G-7 finance ministers meeting in Washington this week will be key to the direction of currency futures at the International Monetary Market but any such agreement will need to go beyond the Paris accord to stem the recent rise in futures financial analysts said If they the finance ministers give the market something really new to look at -- that is some package that goes beyond the Paris agreement -- you could have a real boost in the dollar said Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Anne Mills On the other hand anything neutral would tend to be bearish for the dollar Mills said Traders and analysts agree a simple reaffirmation of the Paris accord will not be enough to halt the decline in the dollar nor will central bank intervention A lot of people are looking for a reason to buy currencies and sell the dollar said one trader for a large retail firm on the floor of the IMM If there is no concrete resolution they will be looking to sell the dollar possibly down to the 180 mark level he said Technically most currency futures are poised for another rise said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane Sloane noted that June yen futures set a new contract high on Tuesday and closed at its best level ever while June sterling set a new contract high on Monday Everything seems to be coming to a head right now and you dont need much to get things rolling Sloane said In particular the June Canadian dollar for which Sloane recently put out a buy recommendation has hovered in a range between 07600 and 07660 in recent weeks forming a triangle on the charts from which it may soon break out on the upside A close above the contract high of 07665 would signal a breakout Sloane said and would likely mean the nearby Canadian dollar contract would extend its advance to near the 07800 level June Canadian dollar closed at 07656 Tuesday Mills noted however that interest rate differentials between Canadian securities and US securities have narrowed dramatically recently with yields on 10-year Canadian bonds only about 80 basis points above US 10-year notes What has helped the Canadian currency she noted is an increasing proportion of foreign funds flowing into the Canadian equity market particularly from Japanese investors Other analysts however said currency futures may be near the top of their long-term rally Something will be done at the G-5 and G-7 meeting to calm people said David Horner of Merrill Lynch Economics The Paris accord has pretty much fixed where major European currencies will trade Horner said But sterling futures may still make another run for new highs up to 16300 to 16500 dlr in the June contract on the positive atmosphere that will prevail before British elections and possibly another interest rate cut Horner said The June British pound closed at 16080 on Tuesday Horner said that new boundaries for the trading range of the yen are likely to come out of the G-5 and G-7 meetings The most likely range will be a bottom for the dollar between 140 to 142 yen per dollar and a top near 150 to 152 yen Horner said In yen futures the bottom of the dollars range would be equivalent to 0007100 to 0007150 in the June contract June yen closed at 0006913 on Tuesday If such a range does emerge from the meetings we will have one more rally in the yen Horner said
2406	Finance Minister Michael Wilson said large inflows of capital into Canada principally into the countrys bond market is a major reason behind the sharp recovery in the Canadian dollar He said the inflow of funds mainly from Japan Europe and the United States is the result of confidence in the direction this country is going in That is the reason why the Canadian dollar today is higher than 75 cts US compared to this time last year when it was a little over 69 cts Wilson told the House of Commons daily question period Figures released this week show foreigners purchased a record 231 billion dlrs of Canadian bonds in 1986 more than double the previous year with Japan investing a record 95 billion dlrs in the market Wilson was responding to opposition party questions about a possible loss of jobs from the rise in Canadian investment abroad Canadian investment including the buying of foreign companies stocks and bonds rose to 1253 billion dlrs from 619 billion dlrs in 1985 The minister said the flow of funds from abroad would generate many new jobs in Canada
3535	Interest in the currency futures market has shifted to the soaring British pound and the potentially explosive Canadian dollar and away from the dull Continental and Japanese currencies analysts said The June pound which added 63 cents over the past week-and-a-half to reach a new contract high of 15930 to the dollar on Monday has spawned a new-found speculative boom Brokers have to push their clients somewhereand technically the pound is in the best shape PaineWebber analyst Jason Gillard said Weve tried to take a bullish approach to the pound and were going to stay with that theres no reason to change Smith Barney analyst Craig Sloane said Many traders took on long poundshort West German mark futures positions although some of those cross-trades were liquidated yesterday Sloane said The fundamental keys to the pounds rise have been relatively high UK interest rates and a vague optimism surrounding the British economy analysts said Money seems to be chasing yields William Byers of Bear Stearns said of the 10-12 pct UK base lending rate Many analysts are skeptical about further gains in the pound on the inference that the Bank of England will seek to relieve upward pressure on the currency by pushing down interest rates after the nations budget is released March 17 The budget itself could have an impact depending on how well it is received but analysts say relative interest rates and oil income remain the main influences on the currency However the market may be able to absorb lower UK interest rates as it has done when other countries have cut their discount rates and extend the pounds rally Sloane said The Canadian dollar has not been rising like the pound but Sloane and other analysts cautiously predicted a big move soon The sideways price pattern in the June contract with smaller and smaller price ranges has formed a bull flag on price charts technically-oriented analysts said It makes for an explosive type of situation that often leads to a breakout in this case to the upside Sloane said Byers agreed there was potential for the June Canadian dollar to rally above the 7700 cent level from the most recent close at 7480 cents to the US dollar At this stage of the game Id call the market long-term positive but for the technical burden of proof you need a close above the previous contract high of 7525 Byers said As to the traditionally more active currencies stability was the catchword and reluctance the watchword among analysts Sloane said it was important that June Swiss francs and June German marks held above support at 06400 and 05400 respectively closing at 06438 and 05430 Yesterdays rebound showed the market was still very respectful of the Paris accord and the threat of central bank intervention by the G-5 nations plus Canada We may still probe to see what the parameters are Byers said but people are very reluctant because they dont know where the central banks will be to intervene Gillard said the mark could drop to a previous price consolidation area around 05250 based on the profoundly sluggish West German economy but that he would be a buyer at that level
