1	Showers continued throughout the week in the Bahia cocoa zone alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao although normal humidity levels have not been restored Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review The dry period means the temporao will be late this year Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 593 mln against 581 at the same stage last year Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end With total Bahia crop estimates around 64 mln bags and sales standing at almost 62 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers middlemen exporters and processors There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining Bahia superior certificates In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1750 to 1780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with JuneJuly going at 1850 and 1880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under New York july AugSept at 1870 1875 and 1880 dlrs per tonne FOB Routine sales of butter were made MarchApril sold at 4340 4345 and 4350 dlrs AprilMay butter went at 227 times New York May JuneJuly at 4400 and 4415 dlrs AugSept at 4351 to 4450 dlrs and at 227 and 228 times New York Sept and OctDec at 4480 dlrs and 227 times New York Dec Comissaria Smith said Destinations were the US Covertible currency areas Uruguay and open ports Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for MarchApril 785 dlrs for May 753 dlrs for Aug and 039 times New York Dec for OctDec Buyers were the US Argentina Uruguay and convertible currency areas Liquor sales were limited with MarchApril selling at 2325 and 2380 dlrs JuneJuly at 2375 dlrs and at 125 times New York July AugSept at 2400 dlrs and at 125 times New York Sept and OctDec at 125 times New York Dec Comissaria Smith said Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 613 mln bags against the 198687 crop and 106 mln bags against the 198788 crop Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after carnival which ends midday on February 27
275	Indonesias exports of tea and cocoa will continue to rise in calendar 1987 but coffee exports are forecast to dip slightly in 198788 April-March as the government tries to improve quality the US Embassy said The embassys annual report on Indonesian agriculture forecast coffee output in 198687 would be 577 mln bags of 60 kilograms each That is slightly less than the 58 mln bags produced in 198586 In 198788 coffee production is forecast to rise again to 58 mln bags but exports to dip to 48 mln from around 50 mln in 198687 Exports in 198586 were 467 mln bags The embassy report says coffee stocks will rise to 13 mln tonnes in 198788 from 115 mln in 198687 It bases this on a fall in exports as a result of the probable re-introduction of quotas by the International Coffee Organisation Cocoa production and exports are forecast to rise steadily as the government develops cocoa plantations Production of cocoa in Indonesia increased to 32378 tonnes in calendar 1985 from 10284 tonnes in 1980 It is projected by the government to rise to more than 50000 tonnes by 1988 Production in 1986 is estimated by the embassy at 35000 tonnes as against 38000 tonnes in 1987 The report forecasts cocoa exports to rise to 35000 tonnes this year from 33000 tonnes in 1986 and 31000 in 1985 The Netherlands is at present the biggest importer of Indonesian cocoa beans The report forecasts that in calendar 1987 Indonesias CTC crushed torn and curled tea exports will increase significantly with the coming on stream of at least eight new CTC processing plants Indonesia plans to diversify its tea products by producing more CTC tea the main component of tea bags Production of black and green teas is forecast in the embassy report to rise to 125000 tonnes in calendar 1987 from 123000 tonnes in 1986 Exports of these teas are likely to rise to 95000 tonnes in 1987 from 85000 in 1986 and around 90000 in 1985 The embassy noted the ministry of trade tightened quality controls on tea in October 1986 in an effort to become more competititve in the world market

10122	International Cocoa Organizations ICCO council chairman Denis Bra Kanon continued work towards a compromise plan on how the ICCO buffer stock should buy cocoa consumer delegates said Consumer delegates said Bra Kanon had not formally presented the compromise plan to producers and consumers and it was unlikely he would do so before Friday they said There was widespread confidence a result on the outstanding items could be reached by Friday when the council session is due to end consumers said Bra Kanon completed bilateral consultations with several delegations today on the main sticking points in the draft buffer stock rules package they said Certain delegations wanted further discussion on the amount of non-member cocoa the buffer stock will be permitted to buy differentials for different origin cocoas and limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and forward material the delegates said The buffer stock working group finalized the remaining buffer stock rules with only minor modifications to the original draft buffer stock package produced last week the delegates said The ICCO council is due to elect a new executive director when it reconvenes Friday producer delegates said Producers intend to present a single candidate for the post and this is most likely to be Edouard Kouame from Ivory Coast they said Earlier the existing executive director Kobena Erbynn from Ghana was expected to re-nominated but he is now likely to withdraw the delegates said The executive committee is due to meet Friday at 1100 GMT with the council unlikely to reconvene until late Friday consumers said
10403	A final compromise proposal on cocoa buffer stock rules presented by International Cocoa Organization ICCO council chairman Denis Bra Kanon is swiftly gaining acceptance by consumer and producer members delegates said We are close nearer than ever to accepting it but we still have some work to do producer spokesman Mama Mohammed of Ghana told Reuters after a producers meeting European Community EC delegates said EC consumers accepted the package in a morning meeting and predicted no problems in getting full consumer acceptance Delegates on both sides are keen to come to some agreement today the last day of the fortnight-long council meeting they said The compromise requires that buffer stock purchases from non-ICCO member countries cannot exceed 15 pct of total buffer stock purchases delegates said The non-member cocoa issue has been among the most contentious in the rules negotiations The 15 pct figure up five percentage points from earlier proposals represents a concession to consumers delegates said They have demanded a larger allowance for non-member cocoa in the buffer stock than producers have wanted Another problem area delegates said was the question of price differentials for different origins of cocoa bought into the buffer stock by which the buffer stock manager could fairly compare relative prices of different cocoas offered to him The compromise narrowed the range of differentials between the origins from what previous proposals had detailed -- a move some delegates described as just fiddling But the adjustments may prove significant enough to appease some countries that were not satisfied with the original proposed differentials assigned to them delegates said The compromise also stated buffer stock purchases on any day would be limited to 40 pct each in nearby intermediate or forward positions delegates said If the compromise is accepted by the council most consumers and producers want buffer stock rules to take effect next week or as soon as practically possible The full council is scheduled to meet around 1500 GMT to discuss the compromise and could agree on it then if all parties are satisfied they said Consumers are due to meet before the council
10449	Consumer members of the International Cocoa Organization ICCO accepted a final buffer stock rules compromise on the condition that producers also agree consumer spokesman Peter Baron said The full council was meeting at 1530 GMT to discuss the compromise which was put together yesterday by ICCO chairman Denis Bra Kanon Consumer delegates said they were optimistic the council could reach agreement on the rules fairly quickly
10505	The International Cocoa Organization ICCO Council reached agreement on rules to govern its buffer stock the device it uses to keep cocoa off the market to stabilise prices ICCO delegates said The date on which the new rules will take effect has not been decided but delegates said they expected them to come into force early next week after which the buffer stock manager can begin buying or selling cocoa Since prices are below the may-buy level of 1655 Special Drawing Rights a tonne set in the cocoa pact the manager is likely to buy cocoa sooon to support the market they said Delegates and traders said they expected the manager Juergen Plambeck to intervene in the market within three weeks of the pact coming into force The rules permit him to buy and sell cocoa from origins or the second hand market on an offer system not by means of a posted price as in the previous cocoa accord The cocoa will be priced according to a fixed set of differentials ranging from 137 stg for most expensive Ghana cocoa to zero for Malaysian cocoa Purchases from non-members such as Malaysia will be limited to 15 pct of the total stock and those on any one day should be limited to 40 pct each in nearby intermediate and forward positions The council meeting which is expected to conclude two weeks of sessions involving various working groups and the council itself was continuing the delegates said The current cocoa agreement came into force on January 20 during a previous meeting of the council which was unable to agree on the rules to implement buffer stock operations
10506	The cocoa buffer stock rules just decided by the International Cocoa Organization ICCO council will take effect immediately delegates said That means the buffer stock manager is likely to begin buying cocoa within two or three weeks after organizing communication systems and assessing the market they said
10584	The International Cocoa Organization ICCO council agreed standard price differentials for different origin cocoas to form part of the buffer stock buying and selling procedure consumer delegates said The buffer stock manager will accept offers for different origin cocoas according to a sliding scale of price differentials under which Ghana cocoa will be pegged at a 137 stg premium to Malaysian Thus if the buffer stock manager was buying cocoa based on a Malaysian price of 1200 stg a tonne he would accept Ghana offers up to 1337 stg Differentials were fixed as follows Country       Differential stgtonne Malaysia           0 Brazil            55 Ivory Coast       67 Cameroun          77 Nigeria          120 Togo             130 Ghana            137 Nigerias differential is on landed weight terms Shipping weight terms will be accepted at a 15 stg discount to this rate
10586	The International Cocoa Organization ICCO council adjourned after agreeing buffer stock rules for the 1986 International Cocoa Agreement an ICCO spokesman said The buffer stock will begin operations immediately he said He confirmed delegate reports that the buffer stock manager will trade cocoa by means of an offer system and according to fixed differentials for cocoa from different origins Purchases from non-members will be limited to 15 pct of the total and buying or selling operations in any one day will be restricted to a maximum of 40 pct each for nearby intermediate and forward positions he said

10742	The new International Cocoa Agreement should lead to a stabilisation of prices both benefitting producer countries and promoting an equilibrium in international economic relations European Community Development Commissioner Lorenzo Natali said He said in a statement welcoming the agreement on buffer stock rules reached last week in London that it resulted in large part from initiatives taken by the EC Commission after consumers and producers had reached deadlock in initial negotiations
10760	The buffer stock rules agreement reached on Friday by the International Cocoa Organization ICCO is an improvement on previous arrangements but the price-support mechanism is unlikely to do more than stem the decline in cocoa prices many ICCO delegates and trade sources said The accord was reached between producers and consumers of the 35-member ICCO council after two weeks of talks European chocolate manufacturers and delegates said the accord may boost cocoa prices immediately but world surpluses overhanging the market will pull prices down again before long If the buffer stock operation is successful I doubt it will do anything more than stop the price from falling further and it will have no relevance at all to retail chocolate prices a European dealer said And if the buffer stock manager delays too long in buying or is not seen to be using his purchasing power when the market is relying on him to do so the bearish trade reaction could pressure prices dramatically dealers said The buffer stock is the market-regulating tool of the ICCO into which cocoa can be bought or from which it can be sold to manoeuvre prices into a pre-set stabilization range A new cocoa agreement came into force in January but delegates could not agree buffer stock rules at that time The new rules take effect immediately The buffer stock manager is expected to begin buying cocoa within the next three weeks after organizing communications with cocoa producing countries and assessing the market since prices are below the must-buy level of 1600 Special Drawing Rights per tonne specified in the agreement the sources said The buffer stock theoretically has funds to buy a maximum 100000 tonnes within a five week period but its approach will be more cautious buffer stock manager Juergen Plambeck said The buffer stock has around 250 mln dlrs in funds and a buying limit of 250000 tonnes of cocoa 100000 tonnes of which are already in the buffer stock ICCO council chairman and Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said the new rules have a good chance of stabilizing prices Ivory Coast is the worlds largest cocoa producer We have established rules which will permit us to withdraw immediately the surplus of cocoa on the world market Bra Kanon told reporters after the council adjourned Bra Kanon reckoned the world cocoa surplus could be less than half the 94000 tonnes estimated by the ICCO statistics committee However some producer and consumer members emerged from the final ICCO council meeting with reservations about the pact Ghana whose high-quality cocoa is the worlds most expensive and provides 60 pct of the countrys export earnings made a formal protest to the council about the price differentials assigned to its cocoa saying they were too high for Ghanaian cocoa to be bought for the buffer stock According to consumer spokesman Peter Baron of West Germany Consumers werent perfectly happy with the buffer stock rules We reached a very sensitive compromiseThere were no real winners or losers Some European Community delegates were not satisfied that important points were fully discussed during the talks and as a result doubted the rules can deal with world surpluses as effectively as they could have delegates said Under the new rules the buffer stock manager would seek offers of different origin cocoas using price differentials to reflect different qualities Non-ICCO member cocoa can comprise up to 15 pct of the total buffer stock London cocoa prices traded today around 1300 stg per tonne down from around 1450 stg in January 1987 and 1750 stg in January 1986 A cocoa withholding scheme can take a further 120000 tonnes of cocoa off the market if a special council session decides market conditions warrant it according to the agreement The withholding scheme can only be used if prices fall below the 1600 SDR lower intervention price for more than five days and if 80 pct of the maximum buffer stock capacity has been filled or if the buffer stock runs low on funds it says The ICCO will discuss withholding scheme rules at an executive committee meeting on June 912 ICCO officials said
11224	Consuming countries chastened by the collapse of International Tin Council ITC price support operations in 1985 are insisting more than ever before that commodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they are serving a Reuter survey showed They want price ranges to be more responsive to market trends - to avoid overstimulating output and straining the accords support operations - and intervention rules that avoid the risk of exports by non-members undermining the pacts Consumers and producers mindful of ITC buffer stock losses have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned a generalised approach to commodity price stabilisation and prefer to assess each commodity case by case the survey showed The International Cocoa Organization ICCO last week set precise limits on what the Buffer Stock Manager BSM could do under the new agreement It imposed daily and weekly purchase limits prohibited the BSM from operating on futures markets and stipulated after consumer insistence that up to 15 pct of total buffer stock purchases could be of non-member cocoa This will help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia the worlds fourth largest producer undermining the market The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the Buffer Stock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades A new International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA was adopted earlier this month in Geneva Importing and exporting countries agreed several changes to make the reference price more responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions under which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance operations Direct cash contributions from members will fund buffer stock purchases Bank financing was a particular feature of the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling Legal wrangles continue Recent International Coffee Organization ICO negotiations in London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that agreements reflect market reality commodity analysts said Consumers and a small group of producers argued that objective criteria should be used to define export quota shares which would have meant a reduction in the share of Brazil the worlds leading producer Brazil wanted to maintain its previous quota share of 30 pct The talks broke down and although an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term negotiations on export quota distribution as remote International agreements exist for sugar and wheat These do not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for discussions on possible future economic agreements collect statistics and draw up market analyses Analysts said differences between sugar exporting countries have held up any progress towards an accord with economic teeth while sheer competition between major exporters amid a world grain glut militate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat An alternative focus for commodity discussions are international study groups made up of governments with advice from industry such as those for lead and zinc and rubber The UN Common fund for commodities with a planned directly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs has failed to become operational because neither the US Nor the Soviet Union has ratified it US Officials in Washington said the US Doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives citing the lack of widespread support US Officials in Washington and Malaysian officials in Kuala Lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commodity pact case by case US Officials said it has been willing to study individual cases for economically sound market-oriented commodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests We see little to be gained by attempting to increase the price of a commodity whose long-term trend is downward official Administration policy states The US Currently belongs to only two international commodity agreements that have economic clauses - the International Coffee Agreement ICA and INRA - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat pacts The US Did not join the International Cocoa Agreement because it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and not designed to protect the interests of consuming countries the State Department said US Officials singled out the INRA as the one commodity agreement that seems to be working US Negotiators were successful in getting other members of the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment mechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect market trends and also to continue the accord as a market oriented agreement US Officials said Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they have consistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts on the merits of each case Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur his country the worlds top producer of rubber tin and palm oil decides its participation in international commodity pacts case by case Malaysia is a member of the Association of Tin Producing Countries ATPC which produce 65 pct of world tin The ATPC launched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96000 tonnes for a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50000 from 70000 Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture and delegate to cocoa wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron told Reuters in London Agreements with economic clauses to stabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were close to market reality if there was full participation by producers and consumers and if participants were prepared to take their obligations in the framework of the agreement seriously But Baron added No real sanctions are available for a country that doesnt stick to its obligationsThe German approach is sceptical We dont think agreements are the best instrument to help developing countries They were never meant to be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how developing countries often interpret them Traditionally Britain has always been supportive of commodity agreements reflecting its strong links with Third World producing countries But recently demands for more stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the need for intellectual honesty and objective criteria have grown British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree of transparency and do not contain the risk of open-ended borrowing that occurred in the tin pact they said UK Delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to reflect changes in market structure and price trends rather than dictate what prices should be A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges price realism in commodity pacts adding high prices inflate supply A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourable to commodity pacts France a large consumer and producer of sugar favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real market situation particularly regarding stocks Indonesias Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja told Reuters in Jakarta These agreements can work as long as the problems are cyclicalBut its another matter when there are structural problemsBut we are still committed to commodity agreements as an act of faith Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producers cannot afford not to give their backing to commodity agreements The political will is not there on the part of some consumers to make agreements work Martinez Cuenca said The head of the economics department in the Brazilian Foreign Ministry Sebastiao do Rego Barros told Reuters an agreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market reality If you have an agreement such as coffee with a system of quotas with a link between prices practised inside the pact and actual market prices it can work UNCTAD spokesman Graham Shanley said consuming countries realise steady export earnings enhance developing countries ability to service debt and mean greater demand for industrialised nations capital goods
11341	The Coffee Sugar and Cocoa Exchange has expanded the normal daily trading limit in Coffee C contracts to 60 cents a lb from the previous 40 cents effective today the CSCE said The new daily limits apply to all but the two nearby positions currently May and July which trade without limits In addition the 60 cent limit can be increased to 90 cents a lb if the first two limited months both make limit moves in the same direction for two consecutive sessions according to the CSCE announcement Before the rule change today the CSCE required two days of limit moves in the first three restricted contracts before expanding the daily trading limit Under new guidelines if the first two restricted deliveries move the 60 cent limit for two days the Exchange will expand the limit The expanded 90 cent limit will remain in effect until the settling prices on both of the first two limited months has not moved by more than the normal 60 cent limit for other contracts in two successive trading sessions the CSCE said
11459	Trade estimates of the coming MaySeptember temporao harvest in Brazils main cocoa growing state of Bahia are now in the 15 mln to 20 mln 60-kilo bag range against 20 mln to 25 mln two weeks ago Traders in the state capital Salvador told Reuters the effects of a dry period in the first six weeks of the year had been harsher than thought earlier Although good flowering had followed the onset of rains in mid-February subsequent pod setting was dissappointing Last years temporao also hit by a dry spell was 277 mln bags In 1984 severe drought cut the crop to 179 mln bags The traders said another factor leading to lower crop predictions is that many farmers are not caring properly for plantations because of low returns on their investment Manpower fertiliser and other costs have been cut back as farmers feel the pinch of the rise in interest rates over the past six months coupled with low bean prices If such economies continue into the winter months both the temporao and the developing OctoberApril main crop could face serious damage from pod rot attacks on trees which would normally be treated against the disease Recent very wet weather has already caused some isolated incidences of pod rot but reports from the growing regions say these are not yet significant The traders said they expect very low deliveries of temporao beans in the first three months of the harvest and the bulk will not appear until the last month September Despite the low loads trees are said to be in excellent condition and recent flowering and pod setting - which will lead to late temporaoearly main crop beans - has been good

11811	The Ghana Cocoa Board said it purchased 214 tonnes of cocoa in the 24th week ended March 19 of the 198687 main crop season compared with 456 tonnes the previous week and 372 tonnes in the 24th week ended March 27 of the 198586 season Cumulative purchases so far this season stand at 217449 tonnes ahead of the 204256 tonnes purchased by the 24th week of last season
11843	Government officials in Malaysia a major cocoa producer have declined to say whether it will join the International Cocoa Agreement ICCA for which buffer stock rules were agreed in London last week Ministry of Primary Industries officials said in January the cabinet would decide on Malaysias participation but so far a decision has not been announced The government is said to be in favour of joining the pact but local cocoa growers and traders told Reuters they are against the idea because certain provisions in it may be to their disadvantage Malaysia is the worlds fourth largest cocoa producer The government feels that the pact through its buffer stock mechanism can help stabilise prices in a market which is labouring under surpluses officials said But growers and traders are concerned Malaysias participation in the pact will require them to pay a levy for exports of cocoa to non-member countries of the ICCA They estimate the levy at around 100 ringgit a tonne at current prices and said they are not prepared to accept it because a big portion of Malaysias cocoa exports officially estimated at 112000 tonnes in 1986 goes to non-members Most growers and traders added they are also against a buffer stock measure under the agreement which requires withholding of cocoa stocks when prices slump Malaysia which produced 117000 tonnes of cocoa last year might be forced to withhold up to 70000 tonnes worth some 30 mln ringgit under such a measure in the long-term and this might affect their economic viability they said The cost of maintaining such a stock can be high and it will be a real messy business for the government and the trade if it ever occurs an industry source said The growers and traders also said that under new buffer stock rules Malaysia can continue to benefit even if it is not a member of the pact as the buffer stock manager is also allowed to buy from non-members for the stockpile Under the new rules purchases from non-members such as Malaysia will be limited to 15 pct of the total stock Malaysia has come under pressure from some producers to join the pact soon officials said but they noted that it need not rush to do so as there are provisions which allow countries to join the agreement even at a later date
12401	Agriculture Ministry officials said they are not considering cuts in import duties on chocolate to help ease friction with the United States over agricultural trade Japan has already lowered the duties sharply and we must consider domestic market conditions an official said Duties on chocolate were cut to 20 pct from 319 pct in April 1983 Washington has been demanding a cut to seven pct equivalent to its own duties ministry sources said Japanese chocolate imports rose to 8285 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 5908 in 1985 official statistics show However the ministry sources added it is possible the government may make further cuts in response to strong US And European demand Due to concern about the farm trade row with the US Top-level government officials may press the ministry to cut the duties one said But he said it would be difficult for Japan to resolve its overall trade row with Washington and reduce its trade surplus which reached 586 billion dlrs in 1986 Agricultural trade issues between Japan and the US Include Japanese import restrictions on 12 farm products
12763	Cocoa futures fell to session lows by midmorning posting losses from last night of six to two stg a tonne in 1987 deliveries dealers said Weekend profittaking by jobbers and general book-squaring featured the fall which was aided by steady sterling versus the dollar and lack of offtake in the physicals market Dealers said the market was switch and straddle-bound in that any pressure on one particular month was certain to be reflected in adjacent deliveries The undertone however remained cautious as operators await an eventual start to ICCO buffer stock buying dealers said The market was originally forecast to open with average five stg gains from last night following New Yorks firmer close yesterday dealers said But this was largely counter-balanced by currency factors Near July traded at its session low of 1327 stg after one hour versus 1333 bid last night and an early high of 1335 Volume midmorning was 730 lots including 350 lots crossed and 108 switches There was no sign of any origin activity

13271	Leading cocoa producers will discuss whether newly-agreed rules on an international cocoa buffer stock will succeed in reversing a sharp fall in world prices when they start four days of talks here later today conference sources said Another topic likely to be discussed at the twice-yearly meeting of the Cocoa Producer Alliance CPA is the pacts second line of market support -- a witholding scheme under which exporters can take up to 120000 tonnes of cocoa off the market if buffer stock purchases fail to defend prices The International Cocoa Organisation is due to discuss the scheme at a meeting in June and exporters could use the Yaounde talks to work out a common position on the issue the sources said Delegates will also be briefed on arrangements for an international cocoa research conference due to take place in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic next month CPA secretary general DS Kamga said The 11-member CPA include the worlds top three producers of Ivory Coast Brazil and Ghana and accounts for around 80 pct of world output
13462	The International Cocoa Organization ICCO buffer stock could face an uphill battle to halt the downtrend in world cocoa prices when it begins buying operations in the next few weeks cocoa traders said Traders said they believed buffer stock purchases could reach 75000 tonnes in a matter of weeks without lifting prices significantly given the amount of surplus cocoa overhanging the market The buffer stock may begin buying shortly as the ICCO 10 day average indicator price is now at 157803 Special Drawing Rights SDR per tonne below the 1600 must buy level Rules governing buffer stock operations were agreed last month by the ICCO council Buying will begin once the buffer stock manager has completed preparations traders said Some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay buffer stock buying until mid or end-April when changes in months used to calculate the ICCO indicator may lift the 10 day average above the 1600 SDR must buy level The ICCO indicator price is calculated from the average of the second third and fourth positions on the London and New York futures markets The daily price was 157761 SDR per tonne yesterday Months used currently for the indicator are May July and September but these are set to change to July September and December on April 15 prior to May becoming the New York spot month traders noted The introduction of December into the calculations may lift the daily SDR price as December is currently quoted about 75 stg above May on the London terminal market But the buffer stock manager would have to wait for the higher daily price to feed through into the 10-day average the indicator which governs his activities traders said The buffer stock manager is obviously looking at the implications of delaying until forward prices lift the indicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa an analyst from a leading cocoa trade house said Traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75000 tonnes fairly quickly once buying starts If purchases reach this level within six months buying is suspended pending an ICCO council review of price ranges But some cocoa market watchers said the buffer stock may benefit from recent forecasts for a poor Brazilian Bahia temporao crop at 15 mln to two mln 60 kilo bags against initial expectations of up to three mln A lower than expected Brazilian crop may cut the 198687 world surplus to between 50000 and 70000 tonnes compared with a recent forecast by the ICCO statistics committee of 94000 tonnes traders said In these circumstances the buffer stock may only need to buy between 20000 and 30000 tonnes to lift prices above the must buy level But some dealers said the ICCO buffer stock rules may put constraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stock manager can remove cocoa from the market The buffer stock system of price differentials set according to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases from non-members could limit the buffer stocks scope for action dealers said Most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock is nearby in-store material of Malaysian and Ivory Coast origin But the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct Malaysian cocoa as Malaysia is not an ICCO member while purchases of nearby cocoa can only reach 40 pct in any one day which forces the buffer stock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material Limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non-member cocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are pressured by the overhang of Malaysian material traders said Buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from quality producers such as Ghana will have only a limited impact on futures but is likely to widen physical market premiums for this cocoa over futures Ghanas premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg from 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer stock buying dealers said The buffer stock may not help the terminal market but will provide a backstop for quality cocoas one trader said Traders cautioned that views on the impact of the buffer stock were all prognostication and that no one could hope to predict accurately what the result would be Psychologically buffer stock buying should help prices but since the buffer stock already holds a carryover of 100000 tonnes from the previous cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus dealers expressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure In June the ICCO is due to discuss rules for a withholding scheme as an additional market support mechanism
2521	Brazils recent announcement of a suspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign debt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views among many international economists and commodities analysts that Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987 The developing worlds most indebted nation is also its most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and soybeans and might maximize foreign exchange revenue by selling hard on world markets economists said That sounds like a reasonable strategy But there is no way they can trade their way out of this situation Aldo Roldan Vice President for International Services at Chase Econometrics said Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted world markets but also had to work to make its position on foreign exchange markets more profitable Domestic costs have increased due to inflation and exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange rates Roldan said The Chase economist also said commodities markets were depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a country like Brazil where pure commodities account for some 50 pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23 billion dlrs But he added They are always pretty aggressive and they have good foreign marketing channels Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be coffee and even without background pressure from foreign creditors the worlds largest producer was expected to hit the market this year with a vengeance Negotiations between International Coffee Organization ICO members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing each other of intransigence Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations which others wanted changed one senior coffee dealer said The dealer who declined to be named said Brazil wanted to preserve its market share At the end of the talks he said Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others would suffer Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales the dealer said If they do come into the market at this level it will go lower and you could breach a dollar ninety or eighty cents he said New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 229 cents lower Thursday at 10468 cents a lb while more distant deliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute Jorio Dauster told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of the ICO talks on export quotas Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the focus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts They will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been according to Richard Loewy analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc Loewy believes the foreign debt problem a good crop plus difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the Brazil soybean crop Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and they cant afford to store the crops he said The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time about large South American crops developing under near ideal conditions towards record yields We are going to see a very rapid decline earlier than usual this year in our US exports Loewy said Tommy Eshleman economist for the American Soybean Association ASA said this years Brazilian soybean harvest could total 18 mln tonnes versus 137 mln last year Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the vulnerability of the US crop to bad growing weather Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a reduction in the US government soybean loan rate offered to farmers who give crops as collateral Eshleman said He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the soybean loan rate which acts as an effective floor for prices by keeping supplies away from the free market Farmers can forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the loan Were getting into a period when they Brazil are starting to harvest and starting to export Eshleman said But he added it will be a while before US exports fall to below 10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel Burnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much as it can this year because of its economic situation He said the debt situation was a major consideration The Brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for storage he added Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops Melicias said it would not make a big difference On other commodity markets Brazils selling impact may be muted no matter its need to generate capital Brazil is faced with a poor 198687 sugar harvest which could limit exports to the world market analysts said The country may have oversold and be unable to honor export commitments and this plus higher domestic demand caused by consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar will give it little room to stretch exports they said Brazils other major crop cocoa is in its third year of surplus Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it fell so I dont think they can start throwing out cocoa and find many more markets for it one analyst said If they come out as aggressive sellers the market would collapse and they cant afford to do that she added

4147	Jacobs Suchard AG expects a world cocoa surplus of around 100000 tonnes in 1987 compared with a 104000 tonne surplus in 1986 Jens Sroka head of commodity buying told a news conference The company expects prices to remain at around current levels despite the likelihood of agreement on buffer stock rules at the forthcoming London cocoa talks and believes market intervention by the buffer stock manager would stabilise prices Sroka said world coffee prices are expected to remain weak if any international coffee talks fail to produce agreement Sroka said stagnating consumption and slight overproduction will continue to weigh on coffee prices and he forecast a continued build-up in stocks The recent failure of the London coffee talks had surprised market observers Unless reason prevails and the major producers return to the conference table the world coffee market will remain free and the consequences for some producers dependant on coffee for their foreign exchange earnings would be catastrophic Sroka added
4470	Pessimism over the effects of a prolonged dry spell on the coming Bahian temporao cocoa crop is rising with trade forecasts generally in the 20 mln to 25 mln bag range against 25 mln to 30 mln a fortnight ago Trade sources told Reuters from the state capital of Salvador that despite scattered rains since mid-February which broke a six week drought plantations have not picked up as hoped and very little cocoa is expected to be gathered in the first three months of the MaySeptember crop The sources said arrivals from May through July might only reach around 600000 bags whereas in normal years a figure of 10 mln to 15 mln bags might be expected Arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as pods from current flowering are gathered However the sources noted a late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot which flourishes if conditions turn cold and humid and which is more likely from late July on This years crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices mean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and insecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over 500000 bags in a very short period one source said Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage estimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely vulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 20 mln bag mark if the disease hits Although flowering was good following the start of the rains pod setting was not up to expectations possibly because the drought had caused a drop in the insect population which pollinates flowers the sources said However reports from farms indicate moisture levels are now generally back to near normal levels and that current flowering and pod setting is good which should result in mature fruit from August through September The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of beans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the main crop which officially starts on October 1 The cut-off date is completely artificial If things go well from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break from August through November or even December one said If predictions of a 20 to 25 mln bag temporao prove accurate this would be below the 27 mln bag average for the past 10 years The last poor temporao was in 1984 when prolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 179 mln bags the lowest since 1974 Good growing conditions the following year produced a temporao of 312 mln bags just below the 1983 317 mln bag record while last years output which also suffered some drought damage was 277 mln bags Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards by the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans The sources said large quantities of beans are believed to have been undeclared from this years record total harvest and they were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by the end of the official crop year on April 30 Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the inclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port warehouses but not declared Because of the high turnover of beans this year significant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored too long at the back of warehouses Some of these are expected to be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals With official arrivals figures for the 198687 temporao and main crops totalling over 61 mln bags and over seven weeks still to go to the end of the year the total outturn should be at least a record 65 mln bags if all production is declared the sources said This would compare with the previous record set last year of 603 mln However there is no way of telling how many current crop beans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporao and thus the true size of the 198687 harvest may never be officially registered

5258	The credibility of government efforts to stabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to the test over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how a buffer stock should operate in the cocoa market government delegates and trade experts said Only two weeks ago world coffee prices slumped when International Coffee Organization members failed to agree on how coffee export quotas should be calculated This week many of the same experts gather in the same building here to try to agree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the International Tin Council ITC which had buffer stock losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling is also casting a shadow over commodity negotiations The ITCs failure has restricted negotiators ability to compromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts with built-in flaws or unlimited liability but want clear lines drawn between aid and trade A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic elements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in Geneva at the weekend Some importing countries insist the International Cocoa Organization ICCO buffer stock rules must not be muddied with quota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to be bought One consumer country delegate said this would distort not support the market Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCO for destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee prices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can founder On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa futures down to eight month lows The strength of sterling has also contributed to the recent slip in prices The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the must buy level of 1600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact which came into force at the last ICCO session in January but without rules for the operation of the buffer stock Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should operate and what discretion it should be given The agreement limits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it cannot operate on futures markets A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost 100000 tonnes of cocoa enough to mount large buying or selling operations were carried forward from the previous agreement Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on all cocoa they trade It has an upper limit of 250000 tonnes The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group on buffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be over non-member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should pay when trading different types of cocoa Another working group is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative matters and the full council meets on Thursday Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds should not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non-member countries such as Malaysia Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer stock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate manufacturers for premium-priced high quality cocoas The argument over buying non-member cocoa is closely linked to the one over differentials for different qualities European industry and trade advisers have suggested as a compromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can represent non-member cocoa and that it use the London futures markets existing differentials for different qualities Currently good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto the London market Discounts which are currently under review range up to 50 stg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would operate when prices are high - the buffer stock should sell the highest priced cocoa in most demand forcing all prices lower The January talks were slowed by a split inside the European Community a key ICCO consumer group with France siding with producers EC representatives met in closed session in Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common ground and a diplomatic source said narrowed the range of positions among the 12 nations The source said the EC will be looking for signs of flexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and will be able to respond if they are there One ICCO delegate describing the producerconsumer split said consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and backs the concept of the pact which is meant to support the market where trade buying is not In contrast he said producers seem to want to sell their cocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers Other more technical issues still outstanding include whether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced posted price as in the previous pact or by announcing it is buying then accepting offers In either case delegates said it is accepted that producers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of cocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a way that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers
5382	Representatives of cocoa consuming countries at an International Cocoa Organization ICCO council meeting here have edged closer to a unified stance on buffer stock rules delegates said While consumers do not yet have a common position an observer said after a consumer meeting They are much more fluid  and the tone is positive European Community consumers were split on the question of how the cocoa buffer stock should be operated when the ICCO met in January to put the new International Cocoa Agreement into effect delegates said At the January meeting France sided with producers on how the buffer stock should operate delegates said That meeting ended without agreement on new buffer stock rules The EC Commission met in Brussels on Friday to see whether the 12 EC cocoa consuming nations could narrow their differences at this months meeting The Commissioners came away from the Friday meeting with an informal agreement to respond to signs of flexibility among producers on the key buffer stock issues delegates said The key issues to be addressed at this council session which divide ICCO members are whether non-member cocoa should be eligible for buffer stock purchases and what price differentials the buffer stock should pay for different types of cocoa delegates said A consumer delegate said producers and consumers should be able to compromise on the non-member cocoa question A working group comprising delegates from all producing and consuming member countries met briefly this morning then broke up into a producer meeting and an EC meeting followed by a consumer meeting Producers who are in favour of the buffer stock buying a variety of grades of cocoa and oppose non-member cocoa being accepted reviewed their position ahead of the working group meeting this afternoon We are waiting to see what consumers say a producer delegate said We hope they will be flexible or it will be difficult to negotiate The ICCO comprises 33 member countries Non-members include the US a consumer and Malaysia an increasingly important producer

5598	The International Cocoa Organization ICCO council adjourned after presenting divergent producer and consumer views on buffer stock rules and agreeing to examine a draft compromise proposal on the buffer stock issue tomorrow delegates said ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn will draw up what some delegates called a pre-compromise and present it to the buffer stock working group at 1130 hrs GMT Tuesday they said While consumer and producer member nations disagree how a buffer stock should be implemented both sides reiterated they were willing to compromise to come to agreement they said I am optimistic we will be able to come to an agreement --maybe not tomorrow or the next day but some time later in the session a consumer delegate said Producers say they want the buffer stock to consist only of ICCO member cocoa comprise a representative basket of various grade cocoas and pay different prices for different grades delegates said Some consumers would rather the buffer stock manager be able to buy non-member cocoa also and pay a single price for the buffer stock cocoa without respect to origin Consumer members were not unified in their views on how the buffer stock should operate with several countries backing different aspects of the producer stance delegates said The semi-annual council meeting is scheduled to run until March 27 Consideration of the buffer stock rules is the most controversial topic on the agenda delegates said
5880	The International Cocoa Organization ICCO buffer stock working group meeting set for 1130 GMT today was rescheduled for 1430 ICCO delegates said The meeting was delayed so a draft compromise proposal on buffer stock rules could be completed they said ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn was preparing the plan in consultation with other delegates for presentation to the full working group they added
6128	The International Cocoa Organization ICCO buffer stock working group began examining a draft proposal for buffer stock rules this afternoon delegates said The plan presented by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn represented a compromise between producer European Community EC and other consumer views on how the buffer stock should operate they said The proposal involved three key principles First the buffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather than using fixed posted prices as previously delegates said Under an offer system the buffer stock manager would be free to choose cocoas of varying prices they said The second provision was that non-ICCO member cocoa could comprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock while the third laid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock manager would pay differentials for different grades of cocoa to be set by a formula the delegates said After the plan was presented working group delegates met briefly in smaller groups of producers EC consumers and all consumers to look at the proposal Producers gave no reaction to the scheme and will respond to it when the working group meets tomorrow at 1000 GMT producer delegates said Consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base to work from one consumer delegate said Delegates said the proposal was only a starting point for negotiations on buffer stock rules and subject to change
6407	International Cocoa Organization ICCO producers and consumers accepted the principles of a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules as a basis for further negotiation delegates said The buffer stock working group then asked ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn who wrote up the draft compromise to flesh out details of the principles with the assistance of a representative group of delegates they said The working group broke up for the day into a smaller group of five producers and five consumers to discuss administrative rules and into the group headed by Erbynn to hammer out buffer stock rules details delegates said Delegates said many differences of opinion still have to be ironed out Whenever we start getting into details the clouds gather one delegate said Erbynn is likely to present fleshed out details of the buffer stock rules proposal to the working group early tomorrow delegates said The principles of the draft proposal included establishing an offer system for buffer stock purchases rather than a posted price system a limit to the amount of non-ICCO member cocoa that can be bought and differentials to be paid for different varieties of cocoa comprising the buffer stock delegates said

6493	New York cocoa traders reacted with caution to todays developments at the International Cocoa Organization talks in London saying there is still time for negotiations to break down I would be extremely cautious to go either long or short at this point said Jack Ward president of the cocoa trading firm Barretto Peat If and when a final position comes out of the ICCO talks one will still have time to put on positions The risk at the moment is not commensurate with the possible gain ICCO producer and consumer delegates this morning accepted the outlines of a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules as a basis for further negotiation A smaller group of representatives is now charged with fleshing out the details Market sentiment has reflected optimism I wouldt put it any stronger than that Ward said It seems to put them slightly closer to an agreement but one shouldnt forget how much they have to negotiate said another trader of todays developments Many dealers were sidelined coming into the negotiations and have remained so traders said The dealers have got historically small positions in outright terms one trader said Speculators have gone net long but only slightly so he added The recent price strength -- gains of about 52 dlrs the last two days -- has been due in large part to sterlings rally against the dollar and in the process has attracted a measure of origin selling traders said
7071	Hopes mounted for an agreement on cocoa buffer stock rules at an International Cocoa Organization ICCO council meeting which opened here today delegates said Both producer and consumer ICCO members said after the opening session that prospects for an agreement on the cocoa market support mechanism were improving The chances are very good as of now of getting buffer stock rules by the end of next week Ghanaian delegate and producer spokesman Mama Mohammed told journalists Consumer spokesman Peter Baron called the tone of the negotiations optimistic and realistic The ICCO council failed to agree on buffer stock rules when a new International Cocoa Agreement came into force in January with deep differences of opinion precluding serious discussions on the matter at that time The existing buffer stock of about 100000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen with a funds balance of 250 mln dlrs The ICCO made buffer stock rules negotiations a priority at this semi-annual council meeting in order to stop the slide in world cocoa prices Consumers and producers agreed yesterday on the principles as a basis for negotiations The council broke for lunch and reconvenes at 1500 hrs A working group which has been meeting since Monday will tackle the buffer stock rules issue again at 1600 hrs when ICCO executive director Kobena Erbynn presents a fleshed-out version of a draft proposal he prepared earlier this week delegates said Mohammed said delegates will have a much clearer indication of prospects for an accord after details of the rules are elaborated by Erbynn and after producers and consumers meet separately later today to examine the scheme The draft proposal included three principles a limit to non- member cocoa comprising the buffer stock an offer system for buying buffer stock cocoa and price differentials to be paid for various cocoas making up the buffer stock delegates said During the morning council session the Ivory Coast delegation gave an open minded statement that it is willing to work out a buffer stock rules solution which could come into effect as soon as possible Baron said Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon chairman of the ICCO council was now expected to arrive in London Monday to attend the talks Baron said Vice chairman Sir Denis Henry of Grenada chaired the meeting in his place Soviet and East German delegates did not attend the council session because of a conflicting International Sugar Organization meeting today but could arrive this afternoon delegates said

8961	The International Cocoa Organization ICCO moved closer to an agreement on buffer stock rules with many delegates saying they expect to reach an accord by Friday Everyone is convinced the buffer stock rules should be in place by Friday so the buffer stock can be put into operation Monday a consumer delegate said The atmosphere is excellent Other delegates said the buffer stock might not be operational by Monday but could be in place by around April 1 if the rules are agreed by Friday A detailed package on how the buffer stock manager will buy and sell cocoa was presented to a buffer stock working group this afternoon -- a big step toward a very interesting stage of negotiations delegates said The package based on negotiating principles informally agreed by delegates has been forged bit by bit during fortnight-long meetings by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn and a small group of other delegates Producers the European Community EC and consumers are scheduled to consider the paper separately and then jointly tomorrow Under the proposal the buffer stock manager would buy cocoa from origins or the second-hand market on an offer system He would alert the market via news agencies as to when he wanted to buy cocoa and include shipment details and tonnage desired delegates said The manager would buy cocoa on a competitive basis rather than choosing the cheapest cocoa as before giving preference to ICCO member-country exporters Standard price differentials would be fixed for each origin similar to golf handicaps to determine the relative competitiveness of offers of various cocoas from different origins they said The differentials could be reviewed at the request of a member country or recommendation of the buffer stock manager the delegates said Revision would be decided by a majority vote of the ICCO council Buffer stock purchases from non-ICCO member countries would not be allowed to exceed 10 pct of the total buffer stock they said The purchases would be limited to 5000 tonnes of cocoa per day and 20000 tonnes per week and could be bought in nearby intermediate and forward positions they added One of the underlying ideas of the rules package is transparency meaning virtually all the buffer stock managers market activities will be public and he will have as little discretion as possible delegates said After the tin market collapse in 1985 when the International Tin Council buffer stock ran out of funds cocoa delegates are anxious to install safeguards in the cocoa market mechanism they said Earnest debate on the buffer stock proposal is expected to begin late tomorrow as delegations feel the pressure of the approaching Friday deadline when the ICCO meeting is due to adjourn delegates said The ICCO failed to agree buffer stock rules in January when the new International Cocoa Agreement came into force The existing buffer stock of 100000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen in place with its bank balance of 250 mln dlrs -- both untouchable until rules are agreed Though the current semi-annual council meeting is not the last chance for delegates to cement buffer stock rules producers are keen to get the wheels of the market-stabilizing mechanism turning to stem the decline in world prices delegates said

9450	International Cocoa Organization ICCO talks on buffer stock rules have slowed during a crucial phase of negotiations delegates said but they remained confident about prospects for reaching agreement by Friday Cocoa producers European Community EC consumers and all consumers separately reviewed technical details of a buffer stock rules package distributed yesterday The buffer stock working group of consumers and producers was set to meet later today to debate the proposal jointly for the first time they said Delegates said major sticking points were likely to be the amount of non-member cocoa allowed to be bought for the buffer stock and the fixed price differentials at which different origin cocoas will be offered to the buffer stock manager Producers would prefer that non-member cocoa not be included in the buffer stock because if it is countries such as Malaysia benefit from the cocoa agreement without joining it the delegates said
9559	International Cocoa Organization ICCO Council chairman Denis Bra Kanon said he will attempt to reach a compromise on buffer stock rules for the International Cocoa Agreement Bra Kanon called for bilateral consultations among producers and consumers Thursday morning to resolve outstanding differences on how much non-member cocoa the buffer stock can purchase and differentials to be fixed for different origin cocoa consumer delegates told reporters Bra Kanon is expected to meet with about eight delegations individually in attempt to iron out remaining problems Producers and consumers indicated support in principle for the draft buffer stock rules package formulated over the past week by a small working group consumer delegates said Despite remaining differences delegates remained confident a buffer stock accord would be agreed to by Friday when the council session ends but certain technical points need further clarification the delegates said Certain consumers are concerned that differentials included in the draft buffer stock package are out of line with market realities consumer delegates said Unless these are modified there are fears it would promote purchases of quality cocoas such as Ghana origin which are normally required by manufacturers they said Restrictions on buffer stock purchases of non-member cocoa might lead to a supply overhang in Malaysian cocoa which would depress prices they added
9903	Madagascars cocoa production is estimated 13 pct higher this year at 2720 tonnes up from 2400 in 1986 Agriculture Ministry officials said This improvement reflects the governments efforts over the last seven years to extend existing cocoa plantations and plant new higher yielding varieties particularly at the northern tip of the island they said Last year Madagascar exported 2189 tonnes of high quality cocoa up from 1624 in 1985 the Trade Ministry said This years exports are estimated at 2400 tonnes
9953	International Cocoa Organization ICCO council chairman Denis Bra Kanon will present a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules to producer and consumer delegates either later today or tomorrow morning delegates said Bra Kanon held private bilateral consultations with major producers and consumers this morning to resolve outstanding differences mostly on the issues of how much non-member cocoa the buffer stock can purchase and price differentials for different varieties Delegates were fairly confident the differences could be worked out in time to reach agreement tomorrow Some consuming member nations including Britain and Belgium favour the buffer stock buying more than 10 pct non-member cocoa delegates have said The consumers argue that buying cheaper lower quality non-member cocoas particularly Malaysian will most effectively support prices because that low quality cocoa is currently pressuring the market Producers meanwhile say non-member cocoa should make up at most a very small percentage of the buffer They say Malaysia should not be able to benefit from the ICCO unless it is a member and if the buffer stock bought Malaysian cocoa Malaysia would have no incentive to join delegates said As to differentials Ghana apparently wanted a higher differential for its cocoa than is outlined in the most recent proposal so it would have a better chance of having its cocoa bought for the buffer stock producer delegates said Some consumers wanted differentials to be adjusted in a way that would not promote buffer stock purchases of the more expensive cocoas such as Ghanaian and Brazilian they said Other technical points need to be sorted out including limits on how much cocoa the buffer stock manager can buy in nearby intermediate and forward positions and the consequent effect on prices in the various deliveries delegates said
