5467	A 092 program would have very little impact on US acreage prompting farmers to idle only an additional 35 mln acres of cropland every year according to a report from the Agriculture Department The savings resulting from the additional 35 mln acres idled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings 35 mln dlrs in transportation and storage savings and 10-20 mln dlrs per year in deficiency payment savings the report said The USDA report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 092 acreage program for wheat corn cotton sorghum and barley Last year almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested The likelihood that the 0-92 provisiion will cause very large acreages to be removed from crop production is quite small the report said The returns on typical farms still favor participation in the usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permitted acreage the USDA report said The 092 program which would allow farmers to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment would be most used by producers in high productionhigh risk areas where cost of production is high said Keith Collins director of USDAs economics analysis staff In the heart of the corn belt you would not get that much participation Collins said USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheat would be ildled under 092 15 mln acres of corn 500000 acres of sorghum and barley and 500000 acres of cotton Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40 mln bushels of wheat 180 mln bushels of corn 20 mln bushels of sorghum 10 mln bushels of barley and 500000 bales of cotton the report said In determining whether to participate a producer would need to weigh the expected cash costs of production against the loan rate  The risk that market prices may rise above the expected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must be considered according to the analysis What youre giving up under 092 is the difference between the loan rate and the cost of production Collins said For producers with low production costs that difference is greater and can be applied to paying variable costs he said Under these cicumstances farmers would not want to go along with 092 But for high cost producers 092 would be more attractive Also as loan rates get lower Collins said there would be more incentives to participate in a 092 program I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal at first but it is a step towards the goal of separating production decisions from government payments Collins said In a speech earlier today before the National Grains and Feed Association USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is too late to implement 092 for 1987 crops since program signup will be over by the end of this month
