The French Cereals Intervention Board,
ONIC, left its estimate of French 1986/87 (July/June) soft
wheat deliveries unchanged from its last forecast at 21.98 mln
tonnes.
    This compared with deliveries of 24.38 mln tonnes in
1985/86 (August/July).
    Estimated 1986/87 maize deliveries were also left unchanged
from ONIC's previous forecast at the beginning of February at
9.91 mln tonnes against 10.77 mln the previous season.
    Barley deliveries were also unchanged at 6.62 mln tonnes

French operators last Friday requested
licences to export 10,500 tonnes of free market maize, 11,950
tonnes of free market barley and 13,000 of soft wheat flour to
non-EC countries, at prefixed daily (droit commun) rebates,
French trade sources said.
    The latest requests for the maize were for export to
Switzerland, Austria and Lichtenstein at a maximum daily rebate
prefixed last Friday at 141 Ecus a tonne against a previous 20
Ecu daily rebate.
    The special daily rebate for maize was set in the context
of a Commission commitment to grant this season rebates for the
export of 500,000 tonnes of French maize to non-EC countries,
in compensation for concessions to the U.S. in the recent
dispute over grain sales to Spain.
    If the latest French requests are accepted as expected,
this will bring the total of French maize exported in this
context to 25,500 tonnes.
    The Commission last Thursday granted weekly rebates for the
sale of 15,000 tonnes of free market maize to non-EC countries.
    Requests for barley were for export to Switzerland, Austria
and Lichtenstein, Ceuta and Melilla at an unchanged pre-fixed
restitution of 125 Ecus a tonne, while requests for soft wheat
flour were for export to various non-EC countries at an

The U.K. Exported 535,460 tonnes of wheat
and 336,750 tonnes of barley in January, the Home Grown Cereals

figures.
    Based on the previous January figures issued on February 9,
wheat exports increased by nearly 64,000 tonnes and barley by
about 7,000 tonnes.
    The new figures bring cumulative wheat exports for the

2.96 mln compared with 1.25 and 1.89 mln tonnes respectively a

    The Soviet Union was prominent in third country
destinations, taking 167,700 tonnes while Poland was credited
with 54,500 and South Korea 50,000 tonnes. Italy was the

The size of French 1986/87 carryover
barley stocks, estimated at 1.72 mln tonnes compared with
700,000 tonnes in 1985/86 is worrying, French Cereals
Intervention Office (ONIC) Director Bernard Vieux said.
    He told journalists these estimates were unchanged at the
end of February from the previous month while export forecasts
were lowered to 4.5 mln tonnes from 5.76 mln in 1985/86.
    Vieux called on the EC Commission to help by awarding a
larger volume of export certificates and said if no outlets are
opened for French barley a large amount could be put into
intervention.
    A small amount of French barley has already been put into
intervention, Vieux said without detailing the amount.
    The outlook for French maize is better with 1986/87 exports
to non-EC countries now put at 700,000 tonnes against 200,000
tonnes at the end of January and against 155,000 tonnes in
1985/86.
    The higher estimate is due to the EC Commission's decision
to hold special export tenders for French maize, he said.

A 0/92 program would have very
little impact on U.S. acreage, prompting farmers to idle only
an additional 3.5 mln acres of cropland every year, according
to a report from the Agriculture Department.
    The savings resulting from the additional 3.5 mln acres
idled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings, 35
mln dlrs in transportation and storage savings, and 10-20 mln
dlrs per year in deficiency payment savings, the report said.
    The USDA report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 0/92
acreage program for wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum and barley.
Last year, almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested.
    "The likelihood that the 0-92 provisiion will cause very
large acreages to be removed from crop production is quite
small," the report said.
    "The returns on typical farms still favor participation in
the usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permitted
acreage," the USDA report said.
    The 0/92 program, which would allow farmers to forego
planting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment,
would be most used by producers in high production/high risk
areas where cost of production is high, said Keith Collins,
director of USDA's economics analysis staff.
    "In the heart of the corn belt, you would not get that much
participation," Collins said.
    USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheat
would be ildled under 0/92, 1.5 mln acres of corn, 500,000
acres of sorghum and barley and 500,000 acres of cotton.
    Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40
mln bushels of wheat, 180 mln bushels of corn, 20 mln bushels
of sorghum, 10 mln bushels of barley, and 500,000 bales of
cotton, the report said.
    "In determining whether to participate, a producer would
need to weigh the expected cash costs of production against the
loan rate ... The risk that market prices may rise above the
expected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must be
considered," according to the analysis.
    "What you're giving up under 0/92 is the difference between
the loan rate and the cost of production," Collins said.
    For producers with low production costs, that difference is
greater and can be applied to paying variable costs, he said.
Under these cicumstances, farmers would not want to go along
with 0/92. But for high cost producers, 0/92 would be more
attractive.
    Also, as loan rates get lower, Collins said there would be
more incentives to participate in a 0/92 program.
    "I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal at
first, but it is a step towards the goal of separating
production decisions from government payments," Collins said.
    In a speech earlier today before the National Grains and
Feed Association, USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is too
late to implement 0/92 for 1987 crops since program signup will
be over by the end of this month.

enrollment of non-base acreage in wheat states, of which a big

a large portion of the non-program acreage, the analyst said.

The Commodity Credit Corporation
(CCC) accepted a bid for an export bonus to cover the sale of
30,000 long tons of barley to Israel, the U.S. Agriculture
Department said.
    The department said the barley is for delivery April 15/May
15 and the bonus awarded was 41.24 dlrs per ton.
    The bonus was made to Cargill, Inc and will be paid in the
form of commodities from CCC stocks.
     An additional 133,800 tons of U.S. barley are still
available to Israel under the Export Enhancement Program
announced June 17, 1986, it said.

The European Community authorised the
export of 25,000 tonnes of barley yesterday, bringing the
cumulative total at weekly tenders since the series started
last June to 3.33 mln tonnes, close to the 3.37 mln under
licence in the same year ago period, traders said.
    All bids for wheat were rejected. However, the total to
date of 5.06 mln tonnes is still substantially more than the
3.03 mln under licence a year ago. The 80,000 tonnes of French
maize granted for export moved the total to 135,000 tonnes
since the tender opened in February this year. There were no
facilities for maize in the previous weekly grain export
series.

Winter kill has probably affected West
German winter barley and rapeseed to an above average degree
this season, West German grain trader Alfred C. Toepfer said in
its latest report.
    It is too soon to assess the extent of the damage, but it
is likely that northern West German crops are particularly at
risk because of insufficient snow cover, it said.
    The soil needs to warm up rapidly and moisture content must
improve to avoid further delays to spring field work, it added.

Rain over wide areas has raised the
prospect of good food crops throughout Ethiopia, which suffered
a disastrous drought and famine two years ago.
    Aweke Aynalem, head of the government's Agriculture
Development Department, told reporters prospects were good for
attaining the target of 250,000 tonnes of grain in the present
growing season, one of two each year in Ethiopia.
    Normal crop production in Ethiopia is about 648,000 tonnes
a year, of which 250,000 tonnes are produced from the "belg"
(small) rains which fall at this time of year.
    The belg rains are used to plant quick-maturing crops like
maize and barley. Any shortfall during this period affects
production in the main rainy season, because farmers eat their
stocks of seed.
    Aweke said peasants in Wello, Tigre and Hararghe -- regions
which suffered severely from drought -- were now able to sow
their crops because of the favourable rains.
    The government had distributed large quantities of seed and
fertiliser, and the rains should ensure a good crop.

Rice and corn farmers will receive
the largest payments from the U.S. government during 1987 if
the subsidies are calculated per planted acre, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    USDA said government outlays to rice farmers in 1987 are
expected to reach 403 dlrs per acre planted, followed by corn
at 135 dlrs per planted acre. Government outlays include mainly
deficiency payments and price support loans.
    On a per acre basis, cotton payments will reach 73.24 dlrs
in 1987, wheat 60.30 dlrs, sorghum 54.38 dlrs, barley 27.41
dlrs and oats 2.31 dlrs, USDA said.
    USDA estimates farm subsidies will reach 25.3 billion dlrs
in 1987. The figures were given by USDA officials at a Senate
Agriculture Appropriations hearing yesterday.
