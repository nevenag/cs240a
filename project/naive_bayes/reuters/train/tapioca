2974	Any European Community decision to liberalise farm trade policy would hurt Thailands tapioca industry said Ammar Siamwalla an agro-economist at the Thailand Development Research Institute TDRI He told a weekend trade seminar here that any EC move to cut tariff protection for EC grains would make many crops more competitive than tapioca in the European market The EC is the largest buyer of Thai tapioca absorbing more than two thirds of the 58 mln tonnes of pellets exported by Thailand last year Thailand has an EC quota of an average 525 mln tonnes a year until 1990 Ammar said Thailand had benefited from an EC tariff loophole that subjects Thai tapioca to a preferential six pct import duty Ammar head of the agricultural research group of the TDRI suggested tapioca farmers diversify to other crops He said If cereal prices in Europe fall so that they are close to world prices the tapioca market there will disappear completely He said the issue may put Thailand in a dilemma because it had recently joined other major commodity producers in calling on the EC to cut its farm product export subsidies
