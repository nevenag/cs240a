The sharp decline in soybean crush ratios
seen in the last few weeks, accelerating in recent days, has
pushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean
processing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean
meal and oil.
    The weekly U.S. soybean crush rate was reported by the
National Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78
mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over
the past two months when crush margins surged to the best
levels seen in over a year.
    Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed
soybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in the
weekly crush number.
    However, much of that export demand seems to have been met,
with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge
in shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next
few months.
    U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feed
demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder
than normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices in
an attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said.
    Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent
weeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in the
nearby March contract today.
    "Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold
May, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow,
which would cause March to gain on deferreds)," one CBT crush
trader said.
    "But they've been bailing out this week because the March
has been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if not
tomorrow, then later in the month," he added.
    As a result of the weakness in soymeal, the March crush
ratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans)
fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents per
bushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last two
days.
    The May crush ended today just over 17 cents, so no
processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable
level, the trader said. Hopefully, they will now start to cut
back production to get supplies in line with demand, he added.
    With futures down, processors are finding they must bid
premiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins.
    A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents
for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, down
sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below
the average cost of production, cash dealers said.
    Most soybean processing plants are still in operation, with
little talk of taking temporary down-time, so far. But
processors will start halting production in the next few weeks
it they continue to face unprofitable margins, they added.

Indonesia"s agriculture sector will grow
by just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pct
in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or
declines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report.
    Production of Indonesia"s staple food, rice, is forecast to
fall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of
26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report on
Indonesia"s agricultural performance.
    The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at
26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in
1987.
    The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mln
tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of
a drawdown on stocks.
    "Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look
promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the
production of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or no
gain," the report says.
    "The modest overall increase which is expected will be due
to significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oil
and palm kernels."
    Constraints to significant overall increases in
agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant
seeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by
farmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the
report underlines.
    The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of
pests known as "wereng" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which
largely offset gains in yields.
    The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57
insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now
resistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, more
resistant rice types.
    The government is depending on increased production of
export commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and
palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude
oil prices.
    Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct
in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports rising
to an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the
report says.
    But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) will
rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports will
also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant.
    The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybean
meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last
September"s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise
in domestic demand.
    The report said that Indonesia"s overall economic
performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight
negative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since the
mid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct
in 1984.
    The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible
for the slump.

Japanese importers bought some 95,000
tonnes of Chinese soybeans late last month for May to September
shipment, under the semi-annual trade accords, trade sources
said.
    The FOB premium rose to 13.50 dlrs per tonne, up 2.50 dlrs
from the premium for the November to April shipment, but down
from 13.80 for the last May to September shipment.
    Flat prices for Chinese beans are based on futures prices
in Chicago plus the FOB premium.
    Japanese purchases of Chinese soybeans, including spot
buying, may have totalled 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes of the 1986
crop for November to April 1987 shipment, down from some
300,000 tonnes the previous year, the sources said.
    Domestic demand for edible-use soybeans is expected to
remain stable at about 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes a year, the
sources said.
    In recent years Japanese importers have overbought Chinese
edible-use soybeans and sold the surplus to domestic crushers,
but low 1986 U.S. Crop prices have discouraged the purchase of
Chinese origin beans for crushing, they said.

Soybean imports are forecast to rise to
425,000 tonnes in 1987/88 (October/September) from an estimated
300,000 in 1986/87 and 375,000 in 1985/86, the U.S. Embassy
said in its annual report on Indonesia's agriculture.
    It said Indonesia did not achieve its goal of
self-sufficiency in soybean output in calendar 1986 because it
did not meet a planned increase in area planted and because
yields have remained below target.
    Soybean meal imports are forecast to fall to around 190,000
tonnes in 1987/88 from 270,000 tonnes in 1986/87 and 295,000
tonnes in 1985/86.
    Domestic soybean production is forecast to rise steadily to
1.08 mln tonnes in 1987/88 from 980,000 in the current year and
890,000 in 1985/86, the report said.
    Imports are forecast to fall in the current year but to
rise in 1987/88 because of a new soybean crushing plant due to
come on stream in early 1988.
    China is the main supplier with a 79 pct share, while the
U.S. Provides the rest, it said.
    "This pattern will likely continue during 1986/87 since
domestic soyfood processors prefer Chinese beans and are
willing to pay a premium for them," it said.
    Area planted is expected to increase by 10 pct in both
1986/87 and 1987/88.
    "Yield increases continue to be hampered by an insufficient
supply of quality seeds, along with pest and disease problems,"
the report said.

U.S. trade representative Clayton
Yeutter today said that if the European Community's Council of
Ministers approves a tax on vegetable oils and fats, another
major transatlantic trade row will erupt over agriculture.
    In a statement issued by the trade representative's office
following a speech to the American Soybean Association's board
of directors, Yeutter said the proposed tax would have a severe
impact on American soybean farmers, who export some 2.4 billion
dlrs in soybeans and products annually to the EC.
    "This is an unacceptable situation for us and its
(vegetable oils tax) enactment would leave us no choice but to
vigorously protect our trade rights and defend our access to
the European market," Yeutter said.
    Yeutter said the proposed vegetable oils tax would violate
EC obligations under the GATT.
    He said the effect of the tax would be to double the price
of soyoil produced from imported soybeans, making margarine
made from soyoil more expensive than tallow-based margarine,
and closer in price to expensive European butter.
    "I am astonished that the EC commission would propose such
a provocative measure so soon after we successfully resolved
the agricultural dispute over the enlargement of the EC to
include Spain and Portugal," Yeutter said.
    "It serves no purpose to embark on another confrontational
course before the recent wounds have healed and as we are
beginning to make progress on the Uruaguay round (of global
trade talks)," he said.

Chicago Board of trade grain traders and
analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to
handle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of new
crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans
in the futures markets.
    Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will
be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because
corn is protected by the acreage reduction program. That gives
deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low.
    Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they
sign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees.
    With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal,
traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing
rather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new crop
soybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans more
attractive under normal circumstances.
    An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the
limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop,
means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln
more oat acres this year than last without being penalized,
traders said.
    Here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking of
shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to the
more attractive deal from the government, they added.
    Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six
months ago, which should prompt many farmers in the South to
put soybean land back into cotton.
    One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean
production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in
traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans,
which are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.

Torrential rains throughout
Argentina's grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarse
grain harvesting in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.
    Sunflower, maize and sorghum harvests were particularly
affected, they said. But the rains proved to be a great aid to
soybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April or
May.
    The rains did no damage to maize, sunflower and sorghum
crops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yields
and cut the total volume of this year's harvest.
    Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires,
with the heaviest rains in the province's western sectors,
between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba, 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa, 10
and 75 mm in Santa Fe, 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios, five and 40
mm in Misiones, and five and 50 mm in San Luis.
    No rain was recorded in Corrientes, Chaco and Formosa.
    Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume of
the coarse grain harvest over last week's estimates.
    Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central Santa
Fe, though slowly. Growers had harvested seven to nine pct of
total planted area, compared to five to seven pct last week.
    Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest was
estimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, or two to
seven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the
1985/86 harvest.
    Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11
mln tonnes, or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6
mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates,
or 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year's volume, according to
official figures.
    The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and nine
pct of total planted area.
    Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowers
for this harvest, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year's figure
of 3.14 mln hectares.
    Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mln
and 2.7 mln tonnes, which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and
41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the
1985/86 harvest.
    Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two and
four pct of total planted area, which this harvest is 1.23 to
1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln
hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.
    Sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and
3.5 mln tonnes, or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2
million tonnes harvested in 1985/86.
    Soybean production, by contrast, is expected to hit a
record 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes, which would mean an increase of
11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year's record figure of 7.2 to 7.3
mln tonnes, according to private estimates. Official figures
put last year's soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes.
    Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very good
condition, helped by abundant rains and high temperatures.

The directors of the American Farm
Bureau, the nation's largest farm organization, voted Tuesday
to urge Congress to leave the 1985 farm bill in place without
alterations.
    "We are solidly opposed to opening up the 1985 farm bill,"
said Dean Kleckner, president. "The current farm bill has been
in place for just a little over a year and in our judgment
there is more to be gained at the present time from maintaining
the legislation.
    "Several independent studies ... indicate the 1985 farm
bill is better on balance than any of the alternatives being
advanced," Kleckner said.
    The Farm Bureau also urged Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng to adjust the loan rate for 1987 crop soybeans as much as
he deems possible under the farm bill to keep soybeans
competitive in the world market.
    A Farm Bureau proposal suggests that producers should be
eligible for supplemental payments in the form of PIK
certificates for the difference between 5.02 dlrs a bushel and
the new loan rate.
    The organization also urged Lyng to authorize deficiency
payments to farmers who were unable to plant 1987 winter wheat
because of adverse weather.

The package of proposed farm policy
changes that the Reagan administration sent to Congress today
includes a provision that would eliminate minimum price support
levels for upland cotton, rice and soybeans.
    The package, obtained by Reuters, also includes a
provision, outlined in advance by USDA officials, that would
increase the annual permissible cut in the basic price support
levels for all major crops to 10 pct from five pct.
    Under current law, the basic support prices for upland
cotton, rice and soybeans between 1987 and 1990 cannot be cut
below 50 cents per lb, 6.50 dlrs per hundredweight and 4.50
dlrs per bushel, respectively.
    USDA's intention to propose scrapping price floors for
cotton, rice and soybeans had not been disclosed previously.

Corn sales of 2,806,300 tonnes in
the week ended March 19 were the highest level since
mid-November, 1979, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    The department said the USSR dominated the week's activity
with purchases of 1.4 mln tonnes (which were earlier reported
under the daily reporting system). Other large increaes were
posted for Japan and unknown destinations, it said.
    Taiwan purchased 296,300 tonnes for the 1986/87 season and
170,000 tonnes for the 1987/88 season, it said.
    Wheat sales of 317,200 tonnes for the current season and
125,000 tonnes for the 1987/88 season were down about one-third
from the preceding week and the four-week average.
    Wheat sales to China of 60,000 tonnes were switched from
1986/87 to the 1987/88 season, it noted.
    Soybean sales of 483,100 tonnes were 11 pct above the prior
week and two-thirds above the four-week average.
    Japan, the Netherlands, Mexico and Portugal were the main
buyers, the department said.
    Soybean cake and meal sales of 289,400 tonnes were
two-thirds above the previous week and the largest of the
marketing year, with Venezuela the dominant purchaser.
    Sales activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of
4,400 tonnes, as reductions for unknown destinations more than
offset increases for Canada, the Dominican Republic and Panama,
the department said.
    Cotton sales of 57,900 running bales -- 43,800 bales for
the current year and 14,200 bales for the 1987/88 season --
were off 25 pct from the previous week and 50 pct from the
four-week average.
    Turkey, Thailand, South Korea and Canada were the major

Japanese crushers have bought some
214,000 tonnes of Brazilian soybeans for late April/early July
shipment and may buy up to 140,000 to 190,000 tonnes more for
June to August shipment, trade sources said.
    Japan imported 128,089 tonnes of Brazilian beans in
calendar 1986, Finance Ministry customs-cleared statistics
show.
    The sources said Brazilian beans were cheaper than U.S.
Origin which may account for the heavy purchases, but added
there were concerns about deliveries from Brazil in the near
term due to labour problems there.
    The Japanese purchases comprise 30,000 tonnes for April
20/May 10 shipment, 102,000 for May, 15,000 for late May/early
June, 36,000 for June, and 31,000 for late June/early July
shipment, the sources said.
    As a result of the large volumes of Brazilian beans
purchased, Japanese crushers will buy a total of only 150,000
tonnes of U.S. Beans for May shipment. Some 100,000 of this
shipment has already been purchased, the sources added.
    They said crushers bought some 270,000 to 280,000 tonnes of

The U.S. grain planting intentions and
stocks reports bear optimistic news for U.S agriculture, a
grain analyst on a Chicago Board of Trade panel said.
    The decline in intended soybean acreage and lower stocks
are "the first report we've had for a long time that shows any
optimism for anybody," said John "Bud" Frazier, grain analyst
and executive vice president for Balfour MacLaine, Inc.
    "I'm really excited about it," Frazier said.
    The U.S. Department of Agriculture said farmers intend to
plant 67.6 mln acres of corn, down from 76.7 mln planted last
year, and 56.8 mln acres of soybeans, down from 61.5 mln.
    The report showed March 1 stocks of 1.4 billion bushels of
soybeans, 8.3 billion bushels of corn, and 2.3 billion bushels
of wheat, all below trade guesses.
    Frazier was joined by Susan Hackmann, senior grain analyst
with AgriAnalysis, and Mark Meyer, a grain analyst with
Shearson Lehman Brothers, Inc., on a Chicago Board of Trade
panel to discuss the reports.
    Frazier said the stocks reports in particular were friendly
for the market, and soybean prices would jump three to five
cents a bushel "if the bell rang right now."
    "We're getting our disappearance up. We have less (corn and
soybeans) than we thought we had," he said, noting that hog and
poultry production is up.
    "We're seeing low prices generate some interest in demand,"
said Meyer, adding that feed use was up 13 pct last quarter and
15 pct in the preceding quarter.
    However, Hackmann said production could continue to exceed
consumption.
    She noted that most of the reductions in soybean acres came
in southeastern states, where yields are usually low.
    "We have the potential for record breaking soybean yields
this year, (which) will temper the enthusiasm on tomorrow's
opening," she said.
    Hackmann said record corn yields also are possible, and the
crop could reach 7.1 billion bushels, which would be down from
last year's 8.25 billion bushels.
    "We'll need very good disappearance next year to reduce
stocks," she said. The USDA estimated disappearance last year
at 6.7 billion bushels.
    Hackmann said the stocks report was positive for the long
term, "But we still have a long way to go to bring stocks down
to where we could start rebuilding prices."
    Frazier also cautioned that the soybean acreage report
could prompt farmers to change their plans and plant more
soybeans.
    The panelists agreed that the reports should discourage
talk of revising the 1985 farm bill.
    "There seems to be no desire ... to change the farm law
we're working under today, and this report should reinforce
that," Frazier said.
    "We are seeing the program beginning to work," said Meyer.

French farmers are planning to cut their
maize sowings by between 100,000 and 150,000 hectares this year
from the 1.87 mln ha harvested in 1986, the French Maize
Producers' Association, AGPM, said.
    It said its first estimate of planting intentions indicated
cuts of 15 to 20 pct in plantings in the northern region of
Picardy and the Paris Basin, which harvested 192,000 ha last
year.
    In the centre-west region of Poitou-Charentes, plantings
were estimated four to seven pct up on last year's harvested
244,000 ha.
    Planting intentions in the south-east ranged between nine
pct less and two pct more than last year's 125,000 ha. In the
south-west the AGPM said producers intended to plant a similar
area to last year's 671,100 harvested hectares, provided water
supplies are adequate in the Midi-Pyrenees region after the
last two years of drought.
    Meanwhile, the oilseed plant breeding association, AMSOL,

U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter said the United States and Argentina have settled a 
case brought by the U.S. soybean crushing industry alleging
unfair subsidies to Argentina's crushing industry.
    Speaking to an Agribusiness Education forum here late
yesterday, Yeutter said the case was resolved at a meeting with
Argentine Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figuerras during a
trade ministers' meeting in New Zealand last week.
    Under a verbal understanding between the two ministers,
Argentina will soon abolish export taxes on soybeans and
products, U.S. and Argentine officials said.
    The U.S. case brought by the U.S. National Soybean
Processors Association alleged Argentina, through differential
export taxes, implicitly subsidized domestic soybean crushers.
    The U.S. crushing industry, in its complaint under Section
301 of trade law, said higher Argentine export taxes on
soybeans than on products encourage the export of products and
represented an unfair trade practice.
    Yeutter told Figuerras that all agencies of the U.S.
government supported the U.S. complaint and unless Argentina
took steps to eliminate the taxes, the United States would
consider taking further action in the case, U.S. and Argentine
officials said.
    An Argentine official here said no timetable was given for
removal of the Argentine export taxes.

Speculation the United States will
offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to have
reached a new level of intensity in the run-up to Secretary of
State George Shultz' visit later this month to Moscow.
    Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheat
markets since officials from the two countries held their
customary, semi-annual grain talks in February. Moscow's
decision at that time to reenter the U.S. corn market
strengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects.
    Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13.
    Shultz' statement two weeks ago that he would not stand in
the way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export Enhancement
Program, EEP, coupled with the announcement of his visit to
Moscow, was interpreted by many grain trade representatives
here as a clear signal that the Reagan administration was
preparing an offer.
    Administration officials -- in and out of the U.S.
Agriculture Department -- have been extremely tight-lipped
about the prospects of a subsidy offer.
    But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned the
contention the proposal is dormant, suggesting that an offer,
while not a "done deal," is a live possibility.
    Prominent U.S. grain trade representatives -- many of whom
asked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that an
offer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent.
    Others, who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible,
are saying they would not rule one out.
    Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., yesterday went so far as to
predict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days
to two weeks.
    Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaders
who had been in contact with administration officials.
    Richard Fritz, director of international marketing at U.S.
Wheat Associates, said he was confident an export enhancement
offer would be made by the middle of this month.
    Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end
up being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier this
year when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrs
per tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat.
    Some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheat
subsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases of
U.S. corn and open the door to U.S. sales of soybeans.
    As ever, one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat deal
would appear to be price.
    Last summer the administration took the controversial step
of offering the Soviets subsidized wheat -- but were
embarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds
that the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left U.S. wheat prices
far above world market prices.
    The administration's decision to set the subsidy level up
front instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be a
means of controlling the price while attempting to dampen
criticism, grain trade sources said.
    Nonetheless, the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultz
from saying the Soviets were "chortling" because Washington was
offering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available to
U.S. housewives.
    The conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives
here is that a general warming of relations between the two
countries since last summer, combined with continued hard times
in the U.S. grain belt, would favor a subsidy offer.
    In addition, the USSR has made it clear it would consider
buying U.S. wheat if it were priced more competitively.
    However, observers have not forgotten the circumstances
surrounding the administration's announcement of the wheat
subsidy offer last summer.
    Up until the time of the announcment, congressional and
industry leaders were led to believe the White House had
decided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include not
only the Soviets, but also a much broader list of countries.
    Instead, the administration scaled back the offer to
include only the Soviets.
    That last-minute change of heart adds a measure of
uncertainty even to the predictions of those most convinced
that the administration will not now pass up the opportunity to
sell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union.

Fresh, heavy rains caused further
damage to the Argentine 1986/87 coarse grains crop in the week
to yesterday, particularly in Buenos Aires province, trade
sources said.
    They said the sunflower, maize, soybean and sorghum crops
were damaged and yield estimates affected. New production
forecasts were made for all these crops.
    The rains over the weekend and up to yesterday registered
more than 200 mm on average in western Buenos Aires and
worsened the flooding in various parts of the province.
    The weather bureau said the rains, which in Buenos Aires
have surpassed 750 mm in the last 30 days, could continue.
    The northeast of the country was also hit by heavy rains.
    In Corrientes province the rains also passed an average of
200 mm in some parts, notably the Paso de los Libres area
bordering on Uruguay.
    In Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces they were over 100 mm
in places, in Misiones and San Luis 90 mm and in Cordoba 80 mm.
    The rains were less intense in Chaco and Formosa.
    Harvesting in areas not actually under water could also be
further delayed due to dampness in the earth, the sources said.
    The excessive humidity might also produce rotting of the
crops, further dimishing the yield, the sources added.
    Sunflower harvesting before the weekend rains reached 26 to
30 pct of the area sown in Santa Fe, Cordoba, La Pampa and
Buenos Aires provinces.
    The production forecast for 1986/87 sunflowerseed has been
lowered to between 2.2 and 2.4 mln tonnes, against 2.3 to 2.6
mln tonnes the previous week, making it 41.5 to 46.3 pct lower
than the record 4.1 mln tonnes produced last season.
    The area sown was two to 2.2 mln hectares, down 29.9 to
36.3 pct on the record 3.14 mln hectares in 1985/86.
    The maize harvest advanced to within 26 to 28 pct of the
area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. It
will begin in La Pampa within about 10 days, weather
permitting.
    Maize yield this season is now estimated at 9.6 to 9.9 mln
tonnes, against last week's 9.9 to 10.1 mln tonnes, down 21.4
to 22.6 pct on the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes at which private
producers put 1985/86 production.
    The new forecast is 22.7 to 25 pct down on the official
figure of 12.8 mln tonnes for last season's production.
    The grain sorghum harvest reached 17 to 19 pct of growers'
targets, against 14 to 16 pct the previous week.
    The production forecast was reduced to between three and
3.3 mln tonnes, against 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes last week, 21.4
to 26.8 pct down on last season's 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.
    The area sown with sorghum in 1986/87 was 1.23 to 1.30 mln
hectares, down 10.3 to 15.2 pct on the 1.45 mln in 1985/86.
    The forecast for soybean yield this season was the least
changed in relation to last week. It was put at a record 7.5 to
7.7 mln tonnes, against the previous 7.5 to 7.8 mln tonnes.
    These figures are 4.2 to 5.5 pct higher than last season's
record of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private sources,
and 5.6 to 8.5 pct up on the official 7.1 mln tonnes.
    The adjustment to the production forecast is due to the
rains and overcast conditions which have greatly reduced the
sunlight needed for this crop, sources said.
    Producers fear estimates may yet have to be adjusted down
further.
    The humidity could induce rotting and growers are still
finding more empty pods due to excessively dry weather earlier
in the season.
    Soybean harvesting is due to start in mid-April in southern
Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires.

U.S. farmers who reorganize their

    Interior grain and soybean prices in the affected counties
will now be based solely against the Texas Gulf. Prior to the
change, county prices were also priced against the Amarillo
market.
    The changes were made to better reflect local market
conditions, said Ralph Klopfenstein, deputy administrator for
commodity operations at USDA.
    "The Texas Gulf has always been the dominant market in those
counties. Amarillo never became effective for that area,"
Klopfenstein told Reuters.

The Agriculture Department must make
a decision soon on how to change the current U.S. soybean loan
or more soybeans will continue to be forfeited to the
government and foreign soybean production will increase, the
president of the American Soybean Association, ASA, said.
    "The USDA will have to bite the bullet one way or another
... USDA can dodge and dart around it (the soybean loan) as
much as they want, but they have to eventually address this
problem," David Haggard, ASA president, told Reuters.
    USDA is not offering any new soybean loan options, and
Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng has not consulted ASA on the
soybean loan, Haggard said.
    "I don't know if USDA is really very serious about
addressing the soybean loan problem," he said.
    At ASA's annual winter board of directors meeting here, ASA
leaders refused to change their official position on the  loan
-- still calling for income support at 5.02 dlrs.
    The association backs current bills of Rep. Bill Emerson,
R-Mo. and Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., which call for either a
5.02 marketing loan or a producer option payment.
    Haggard said he does not know what chances the ASA-backed
proposals have but said, "in all honesty, we do not want to see
the farm bill be torn apart."
    He said if USDA feels it cannot withdraw its opposition to
a market loan, there are still numerous ways the USDA could
change the loan without new legislation.
    Making the loan partially in certificates which would not
have to be paid back would be one option, he said.

Corn sales gained 2,494,900 tonnes in
the week ended February 26, the highest weekly total since
August 1984 and two and three-quarter times the prior week's
level, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    In comments on its Export Sales Report, the department said
sales of 1.0 mln tonnes to the USSR -- previously reported
under the daily reporting system -- were the first sales for
delivery to the USSR under the fourth year of the U.S.-USSR
Grains Supply Agreement, which began October 1.
    Japan added 689,700 tonnes to previous purchases and sales
to unknown destinations rose by 429,800 tonnes.
    Wheat sales of 362,400 tonnes for the current season and
151,000 for the 1987/88 season were down by more than half from
the previous week's combined sales, it said.
    Egypt, Japan and Iraq were the major wheat buyers for
delivery in the current year, while sales to China decreased by
30,000 tonnes for the current season, but increased by 90,000
tonnes for the 1987/88 season, which begins June 1.
    Net sales of soybeans totalling 274,200 tonnes equaled the
preceding week, but were nearly a third below the four week
average. Major increases were for Belgium, South Korea, Mexico
and Italy, it said.
    Soybean cake and meal sales of 103,700 tonnes were 2-3/4
times the previous week's marketing year low, but six pct less
than the four week average.
    Major increases for West Germany, Belgium, Spain, Italy and
Australia were partially offset by declines to unknown
destinations.
    Soybean oil sales of 5,400 tonnes were the result of
increases for Venezuela and reductions of 500 tonnes for
unknown destinations.
    Combined sales activity in cotton of 75,200 running bales
-- 44,700 bales for the current year and 30,500 bales for the

Brazil's recent announcement of a
suspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign
debt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views
among many international economists and commodities analysts
that Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987.
    The developing world's most indebted nation is also its
most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as
coffee and soybeans, and might maximize foreign exchange
revenue by selling hard on world markets, economists said.
    "That sounds like a reasonable strategy. But there is no
way they can trade their way out of this situation," Aldo
Roldan, Vice President for International Services at Chase
Econometrics, said.
    Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the
problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted
world markets, but also had to work to make its position on
foreign exchange markets more profitable.
    "Domestic costs have increased (due to inflation) and
exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange
rates," Roldan said.
    The Chase economist also said commodities markets were
depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a
country like Brazil, where pure commodities account for some 50
pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23
billion dlrs.
    But he added: "They are always pretty aggressive and they
have good foreign marketing channels."
    Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be
coffee, and even without background pressure from foreign
creditors the world's largest producer was expected to hit the
market this year with a vengeance.
    Negotiations between International Coffee Organization
(ICO) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up
earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing
each other of intransigence.
    "Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations,
which others wanted changed," one senior coffee dealer said.
    The dealer, who declined to be named, said Brazil wanted to
preserve its market share. At the end of the talks, he said
Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others
would suffer.
    Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but
as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales, the
dealer said.
    "If they do come into the market at this level it will go
lower and you could breach a dollar, ninety or eighty cents,"
he said.
    New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2.29 cents
lower Thursday at 104.68 cents a lb, while more distant
deliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit.
    President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, Jorio Dauster
told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has
no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of
the ICO talks on export quotas.
    Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the
focus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts. "They
will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been,"
according to Richard Loewy, analyst for Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
    Loewy believes the foreign debt problem, a good crop, plus
difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the
Brazil soybean crop. "Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and
they can't afford to store the crops," he said.
    The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time
about large South American crops developing under near ideal
conditions towards record yields.
    "We are going to see a very rapid decline, earlier than
usual, this year in our (U.S.) exports," Loewy said.
    Tommy Eshleman, economist for the American Soybean
Association (ASA), said this year's Brazilian soybean harvest
could total 18 mln tonnes, versus 13.7 mln last year.
    Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices
are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the
vulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather.
    Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a
reduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate, offered to
farmers who give crops as collateral, Eshleman said.
    He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the
soybean loan rate, which acts as an effective floor for prices
by keeping supplies away from the free market. Farmers can
forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the
loan.
    "We're getting into a period when they (Brazil) are
starting to harvest and starting to export," Eshleman said. But
he added it will be a while before U.S. exports fall to below
10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently.
    Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel
Burnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much
as it can this year because of its economic situation.
    He said the debt situation was a major consideration. "The
Brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for
storage," he added.
    Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil
would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops, Melicias said
it would not make a big difference.
    On other commodity markets, Brazil's selling impact may be
muted no matter its need to generate capital.
    Brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest, which
could limit exports to the world market, analysts said. The
country may have oversold and be unable to honor export
commitments, and this plus higher domestic demand caused by
consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar, will
give it little room to stretch exports, they said.
    Brazil's other major crop, cocoa, is in its third year of
surplus. "Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it
fell, so I don't think they can start throwing out cocoa and
find many more markets for it," one analyst said.
    "If they come out as aggressive sellers, the market would
collapse and they can't afford to do that," she added.

Japanese crushers are likely to buy at
least 200,000 tonnes of Brazilian soybeans this year and
another 100,000 to 200,000 if quality and shipping conditions
are good against 128,089 tonnes in 1986, trade sources said.
    A Japanese trading house recently bought about 31,000
tonnes of soybeans for April 10/May 10 shipment, they said.
    "Because Brazilian soybean prices are now some 10 cents a

Lower production of coconut
and palm oils could lead to a decline in vegetable oil stocks
this year despite growing supplies of oilseeds, senior oilseeds
analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Mario Balletto said.
    Balletto told a conference of Canadian farmers at Alberta
Agriculture's annual farm outlook conference that the world
vegetable oil situation is one of potentially tight supplies.
    "Prices for edible oils appear to have more upside
potential reflecting strong world demand and an unprecedented
decline in the production of tree oils," Balletto said.
    Balletto estimated production of palm, coconut and palm
kernel oils this year at 8.5 mln tonnes, down from 9.1 mln
tonnes last year, enough to offset higher oilseed output.
    He estimated total vegetable oil production this year at
33.4 mln tonnes, up from 33.0 mln last year, and disappearance
at 34.0 mln tonnes, up from 32.6 mln.
    Unless oilseed crushing increases sharply, he said,
disappearance of vegetable oils could exceed production by
600,000 tonnes, the largest deficit since 1976.
    "If world protein meal demand stagnates, thus limiting the
crush of soybeans ... the need for serious supply rationing in
the edible oils sector could develop," he said.
    "This would be relatively favorable for the prices of high
oil yielding seeds," Balletto said.
    Oilseeds, on the other hand, remain at depressed prices
because of burdensome supplies, he said.
    World ending stocks of oilseeds are estimated to increase
for the fourth straight year to a record 28.4 mln tonnes,
compared with 25.4 mln last year.
    The increase should result from lower disappearance, as
production is expected to fall to 184.0 mln tonnes from 185.7
mln last year, he said.
    World soybean production in 1987 totalled a record 98.9 mln
tonnes, up from 90.6 mln the previous year, Balletto said,
while production of other oilseeds was lower.
    Higher soybean production in South America and Europe made
up for lower production in the United States, he said.
    Soybeans account for the bulk of the surplus, and U.S.
stocks make up most of those, Balletto said.
    The Commodity Credit Corporation owned 12.7 mln tonnes,
about half of the world soybean surplus, he said.
    Since 1983-84, he said, world oilseed stocks have increased
13.1 mln tonnes.
    "During the same period, U.S. soybean stocks increased 12.1
mln tonnes, becoming the dumping ground of the entire world
surplus, courtesy of the CCC and highlighting the artificially
high prices caused by the U.S. loan program."
    "Soybean prices and, to a great extent, world oilseeds
prices are likely to be dominated by the loan program, as long
as the U.S. soybean surplus continues.
    For the 1987 crop, he said, prices are likely to hover in a
range tied to the U.S. loan program.
    "Upside potential for prices is limited by the huge supply
overhang while strong underlying support is provided by the
U.S. loan rate."
    The problem is likely to become worse as the artificially
high prices encourage producers in South America, Canada and
Australia to shift from grains to oilseeds, Balletto said.

Enrollment in the U.S. Agriculture
Department's fourth conservation signup is expected to be
announced tomorrow, and USDA officials said the figure may be
higher than total enrollment for the first three signups.
    Enrollment will be in the range of seven to 12 mln acres,
USDA conservation specialists said. Total enrollment so far in
the 10-year conservation program is 8.9 mln acres.
    Producers submitted bids to enter 11 to 12 mln acres into
the program, Milton Hertz, administrator for USDA's
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service said at a
congressional hearing yesterday. Not all the bids will be
accepted, Hertz said, but enrollment is expected to be high.
    As in the first three signups, the Great Plains area is
expected to attract the greatest enrollment.
    "The Great Plains area will be the predominate area which
we'll get signup in," a USDA conservation specialist said.
    Marginal corn acreage will likely be the bulk of the
acreage pulled from that area, he said.
    Fringe soybean acres in the southeast and some bean acreage
in the midwest are also expected to be taken out of production,
but the USDA source said this would be a relatively small
percent of the total.
    A special two dlr bonus to corn producers who enroll part
of their corn base acreage into the program has sparked more
interest in this latest signup, USDA officials said.
    Under the program, USDA pays farmers annual rents to take
land out of production for 10 years. The average rent payment
accepted in the first three signups was 43.50 dlrs per acre.

Implementation of a one-year 0/92
pilot program for wheat and feedgrains was strongly promoted
today by the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee
as a way to cut farm costs and simultaneously give farmers
another option when making their planting decisions.
    "We have a budget driven farm policy. It may be a shame,
but we are locked into this," said Dan Glickman, (D-Kans.),
chairman of the subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed
grains. "We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt the
farmer. A 0/92 plan, if properly done, could do both."
    Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 0/92 bill
for 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains. An aide to Glickman
said that it will probably be introduced next week.
    Glickman said a 0/92 program, which allows a farmer to
forego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency
payment, would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill --
only an extension of the 50/92 option already provided under
the current bill.
    It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill,
he said, but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet
budget goals, a voluntary 0/92 plan would be better than
sharply cutting target prices, as USDA has proposed.
    A 0/92 plan, however, would not be decoupling, but simply a
different type of acreage diversion program, Glickman said.
    Decoupling -- delinking planting decisions from government
payments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at this
point, he said.
    "I don't think there is any interest in pursuing a
decoupling bill this year. Period. Unequivocal," Glickman said
at the hearing.
    Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), cosponsor of the
Boren/Boschwitz decoupling plan, said he supports a short term
0/92 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan.
    Boschwitz plans to introduce a 0/92 plan in the senate. His
plan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment to
participating farmers, require that idled acreage be put to
conservation use only, prohibit haying and grazing on extra
idled acreage, limit participation to a certain number of acres
in a county and provide tenant protection provisions.
    "I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987, but
we can at least move in that direction," Boschwitz said.
    Robbin Johnson, vice president of Cargill, Inc., testified
in favor of decoupling. Decoupling would end the current bias
in U.S. farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers'
dependency on the government, he said.
    A 0/92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling, Johnson
said, and would still encourage farmers to plant.
    Officials from the National Corn Growers Association and
the National Cattlemen's Association said their groups oppose
any 0/92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening the
farm bill and creating more confusion among farmers.
    But when asked if his association were forced to choose
between a ten pct cut in target prices or a 0/92 program, Larry
Johnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 0/92
rather than take sharp cuts in target levels.

A marketing loan for U.S. wheat,
feedgrains and soybeans would do nothing to help the surplus
production situation and would be extremely costly, Sen. Rudy
Boschwitz (R-Minn.) said.
    "I think I would not support a marketing loan now," he told
the House agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and
feedgrains. Boschwitz was one of the original supporters of a
marketing loan for cotton and rice, but has since focused
support on decoupling legislation, the Boren/Boschwitiz bill.
    A market loan for grains and soybeans would encourage more
production, especially in high-yielding areas, would be much
more expensive than the current cotton and rice marketing loans
and not increase exports significantly, he said.

American soybean producers are
confident the proposed European Community (EC) tax on vegetable
oils and fats will be rejected but are leaving nothing to
chance, American Soybean Association (ASA) president-elect
Wayne Bennett said.
    Bennett, who is leading one of three soybean producer
delegations on a lobbying tour of EC capitals, was speaking at
a lunch.
    After meetings at the Economics and Foreign ministries this
morning, he said the Dutch Government had indicated it would
vote against the proposal, as had a number of other countries.
    "Our information suggests we will have the required number
of votes in Brussels to prevent the tax proposal going forward,"
he said.
    "The proposal has been talked of in Brussels for the past 20
years, and dropped every time. What we want now is to kill it
once and for all," Bennett added.
    Backing up the soybean producers' active lobbying, the U.S.
Government has also indicated it will be prepared to retaliate
with penal import taxes if the proposal does get through, he
said.
    The U.S. Government also feels it has a good case to fight
the proposed tax in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT), a U.S. Embassy spokesman said.
    U.S. Exports of soybeans and products to the EC account for
one-fifth of annual production, and are worth about 2.5 billion
dlrs a year, Bennett said.
    The proposed tax on oils and fats would hit U.S. Producers
badly while at the same time virtually doubling the price of
soyoil in the EC, which would suffer far worse than other
higher-priced oils because of the nature of the proposed tax,
he added.
    The revenue to the EC from the tax would simply be used to
finance the EC's own oilseed subsidy machine, he said.
    "We in the ASA are dedicated free-traders. We helped defeat
the Wine Equity Act two years ago, but we will not stand by and
watch our own farmers suffer from such protectionist EC
measures," Bennett said.
    "The mood in the U.S. Is turning increasingly protectionist,
and the EC's actions are fueling the chances of a trade war,"
he added.

enrollment of non-base acreage in wheat states, of which a big
percentage would be fallow and non-soybean land, accounted for
a large portion of the non-program acreage, the analyst said.
    Wheat and corn acreage comprised slightly over 40 pct of
the total 10,572,402 acres accepted into the ten-year program.
    USDA analysts gave the following enrollment breakdown:
    -- wheat  2,615,140 acres
    -- corn   1,894,764 acres
    -- barley   705,888 acres
    -- sorghum  585,552 acres
    -- cotton   417,893 acres
    -- rice       2,035 acres
    -- peanuts      611 acres
    -- tobacco      285 acres
    -- total program crops  6,512,700 acres
    -- total nonprogram     4,059,702 acres
    -- total enrollment    10,572,402 acres
    USDA analysts are currently working on a complete state
breakdown of crop acreage enrollment and should have it ready
for publication later this week, they said.

A high-level meeting last week which
included the Secretary of Agriculture and other senior  USDA
officials, along with leaders of the major soybean lobbying
groups, failed to reach any decision on what should be done
about the soybean loan level, participants at the meeting told
Reuters.
    "We didn't feel a lot was accomplished last week, but we
were delighted to meet with the Secretary, and he didn't close
the door on anything," a member of the soybean delegation said.
    At issue is the current soybean loan and the fact that at
the present level of 4.77 dlrs (without Gramm-Rudman
reductions) it encourages foreign soybean production by making
soybeans more profitable to grow than corn.
    But while recognizing that soybeans are priced too high in
relation with corn, soybean groups have pledged their support
to maintaining current price supports for soybean growers.
    Leaders of the American Soybean Association and the
National Soybean Processors Association offered specific loan
options to USDA Secretary Lyng in last week's meeting, but
participants would not reveal what those options were.
    "There were no surprises in our package," one participant
said. Bandied about for several weeks has been the idea of
offering producers soybean loans partially in cash and in
certificates.
    The most prevailing scheme would be to pay a 4.77 loan with
77 cts worth of soybean-specific certificates which would not
have to be paid back and the remaining four dlrs in cash.
    This would have the effect of lowering the world price,
maintaining domestic support levels and reducing the
government's soybean inventory.
    A marketing loan for soybeans was not discussed at last
week's meeting, participants said.
    One member of the soybean delegation said that the meeting
was a "listening session" for USDA, and that the proposals will
now be studied further by the Department.
    USDA officials, however, would not commit to any time
frame. Participants in the meeting do not look for changes in
the soybean loan to be announced in the near future.
    "USDA is very sensitive about saying anything that could
influence the market, so the Secretary was very non-committal,"
a participant said.

Italy's response to protests by U.S.
Soybean producers about the proposed European Community (EC)
tax on vegetable oils and fats had not been encouraging,
American Soybean Association (ASA) board chairman George
Fluegel said.
    Fluegel, heading one of three U.S. Soybean producer
delegations currently on a lobbying tour of EC countries, told
Reuters in an interview meetings with officials from the
Italian Foreign and Agricultural ministries had not yielded
much to encourage hopes that Italy would vote against the
proposed tax.
    Fluegel said his delegation had received a negative
response from the Italian Agriculture Ministry, but that the
attitude of the Foreign Ministry appeared "more realistic."
    He said the proposed tax was discriminatory against U.S.
Farmers since it was basically asking them to help finance the
EC's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) on oilseeds.
    Asked which EC countries might be expected to vote against
the proposed tax, he said, "Realistically, from the information
we're getting, it looks like the English, the Germans,
hopefully the Netherlands and Denmark." His delegation also
hoped to convince Belgium to vote against the issue, he added.
    Asked what form he thought U.S. Retaliatory action might
take in the event of the EC tax proposal being approved,
Fluegel said industrial as well as agricultural products could
be involved.
    U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng warned the EC
yesterday it would face serious retaliation if it enacted the
tax.
    ASA president-elect Wayne Bennett said yesterday in The
Hague American soybean producers were confident the proposed
tax would be rejected.

Upcoming changes being considered in
the U.S. Agriculture Department's transportation and loan
programs were outlined by a USDA official today.
    Addressing the annual meeting of the National Grain and
Feed Association, Tom VonGarlem, assistant deputy administrator
for USDA's state and county operations, said the following
changes are under consideration by USDA.
    Termination of USDA's Transportation Assistance Program for

    Changes in USDA's reserve rotation program are also under

made any final decision, banning the use of pik and roll grain
in reserve rotation is under heavy consideration, he said.
    Changes in loan rates will definitely be looked at for next
year's crop, he said, with the option of making soybean loans
partially in cash and in certificates under consideration.
    VanGarlem said he will definitely not extend the 1987 crop

Seven major U.S. farm groups took
the unusual step of releasing a joint statement urging
congressional leaders not to tinker with existing farm law.
    Following meetings with House Agriculture Committee
Chairman Kika de la Garza (D-Tex.) and Senate Agriculture
Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the groups issued a
statement saying lawmakers should "resist efforts to overhaul
the 15-month-old law, which is operating in its first crop
marketing year."
    The farm groups included the American Farm Bureau
Federation, American Soybean Association, National Cattlemen's
Association, National Corn Growers Association, National Cotton
Council, National Pork Producers Council and the U.S. Rice
Producers Legislative Group.
    The statement said Congress should not modify the 1985 farm
bill "so the law might have its intended impact of making
agriculture more competitive in export markets while at the
same time maintaining farm income."
    "We strongly believe American farmers now need
predictability and certainty in farm legislation in order to
have any opportunity of making proper production and marketing
decisions," the groups said.

Argentine grain growers reduced
their estimates for maize and soybean production in the current
harvest in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.
    Soybean production for 1986/87 is now estimated to reach
between 7.7 and eight mln tonnes, versus 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnes
estimated a week ago and eight to 8.4 mln tonnes estimated in
mid-February.
    But even the lowest of those estimates would be 8.5 to 12.7
pct greater than last year's total of 7.1 mln tonnes, according
to official figures, and would be a new record.
    The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was a
record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares and increased 10.8 to 13.8 pct
compared to the 3.3 mln hectares planted last year.
    The change in yield estimates is due to very high
temperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year in
the soybean-producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and
northern Buenos Aires province.
    The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybean
pods empty, especially in Cordoba.
    Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops, since
rainfall was slight in most main soybean-producing areas.
    Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak in
Buenos Aires province, totalling between one and 10 mm. There
was no recorded rain in other grain-producing provinces.
    With clear skies and seasonable temperatures, fields were
able to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recent
weeks, allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize,
sunflower and sorghum harvesting.
    Crops were considered in generally good condition, though
it is still too early to judge whether the intense rains of
recent weeks caused any long-term damage.
    The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of the
total area planted, compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago.
    Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at
3.58 to 3.78 mln hectares, down two to seven pct from the 3.85
mln hectares planted in the previous harvest.
    Total production for the current maize harvest is expected
to reach between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes, versus 10 to 10.2 mln
tonnes estimated a week ago. The new figure is 21.1 to 22.7 pct
lower than the 12.8 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest,
according to official figures.
    The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct of
total planted area, versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago.
    Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was two
to 2.2 mln hectares, or 29.9 to 36.3 pct lower than the record
3.14 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.
    The current harvest's volume was again expected to be
between 2.3 and 2.6 mln tonnes, or 34.1 to 41.5 pct lower than
last harvest's record 4.1 mln tonnes.
    Yields varied widely from area to area, and growers feared
that heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll on
crops and, consequently, on total production volume.
    The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct of
total planted area, compared to four to six pct a week ago.
    Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 1.2 and
1.3 mln hectares, or 10.3 to 15.2 pct lower than the 1.4 mln
hectares planted in the previous harvest.
    Estimates for total sorghum production this harvest
remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes again this week, or 16.7 to
22 pct lower than last harvest's total volume of 4.1 to 4.2 mln
tonnes.

Soybeans produced in the United
States face a competitive price problem because of the loan
rate provisions of the 1985 farm bill, U.S. Undersecretary of
Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said.
    Amstutz told a House Agriculture Appropriations
subcommittee hearing that soybeans are caught in a "squeeze"
because the Farm Bill allowed steep cuts in grain loan rates
while limiting the soybean reduction.
    As a result, he said U.S.-produced soybeans "have a price
problem" in competing with other soybean producing countries.
    Amstutz called the situation a "dilemma" for the USDA, and
said "we have spent hours in ASCS (Agriculture Stabilization

American soybean producers and processors
are hoping the proposed EC tax on vegetable oils and fats will
not be imposed, but say the U.S. Is prepared to retaliate if it
is introduced.
    Wayne Bennett, the American Soybean Association's first
vice president, told a news conference the U.S. Administration
would not hesitate to retaliate, but both producers and
processors were trying to solve the issue through negotiation.
    U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng said in a letter
to EC officials that U.S. Retaliatory measures would cover more
than agricultural products if the tax was imposed, Bennett
said.
    The ASA and National Soybean Processors Association (NSPA)
delegations will meet top West German government officials
today and tomorrow to lobby for support.
    Bennett said West Germany, Britain, the Netherlands,
Denmark and Portugal oppose the tax, but Italy and Belgium seem
to have taken a hardline view on the issue.
    "Europeans in favour of the tax say it would be to their
advantage economically, but that is not correct because we
would hit back," NSPA chairman Jack Reed said.
    This step would be very expensive for all and no one would
emerge as a winner if the tax were introduced, he said.
    Reed pointed out the U.S. Administration and the soybean
industry view the EC proposal as violating the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
    The proposed tax also violates the zero duty bindings
agreed between the EC and U.S. In 1962, he said.
    Under the zero duty bindings pact U.S. Soybeans and
products can be exported to the Community duty-free.

Several leading farm-state
Congressmen said they will press the U.S. Agriculture
Department to implement some kind of marketing loan to make
soybeans exports competitive while protecting farm income.
    Speaking at a House grains subcommittee hearing, chairman
Dan Glickman, D-Kan., proposed that Congressmen and
representatives of soybean growers meet with USDA on the
subject in the next two weeks.
    "Let's see if we can try to push them (USDA) to do
something without legislation," Glickman told the hearing.
    The current soybean loan rate effectively is 4.56 dlrs per
bushel with no income protection, or marketing loan.
    David Haggard, American Soybean Association, ASA, president
said USDA must make changes in the soybean program.
    The current soybean program "gave us the worst of both
worlds," ASA's Haggard told the hearing. The 1987 loan rate is
too high relative to corn and is encouraging an expansion of
soybean production in South America, he said. At the same time,
the U.S. soybean loan rate is too low to provide any income
support for soybean farmers, Haggard said.
    "We need some kind of market loan," he added.
    The 1985 farm bill provides authority for the Agriculture
Secretary to implement a marketing loan for soybeans but USDA
so far has resisted pressure to use the authority.
    Representatives of ASA met earlier this month with USDA,
but Haggard said USDA officials gave no indication if they
would seriously consider offering a marketing loan.
    USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz yesterday said the
soybean situation is a "dilemna" which has been studied
extensively by the department. But he did not say what, if any
changes, are under consideration.
    In his testimony, Haggard indicated there are ways other
than a marketing loan which should be considered to help
soybean growers, such as a so-called producer option payment,
or a direct payment program.
    Haggard said barring any program changes, Commodity Credit
Corporation, CCC, soybean stocks, now at 385 mln bu, will rise
to 500 mln by the end of August. A further 100 mln bu of
soybeans could be forfeited between September and end-year.
    "Thus, CCC could own the equivalent of Brazil's entire
soybean crop by the end of calendar year 1987," Haggard said.
    However, Haggard said that the U.S. should be cautious in
making soybean program changes that might allow the European
Community to challenge the U.S. program under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT.
    He noted that The EC imports one quarter of U.S. soybean
production and loss of that market would be devastating.
    The Reagan administration has given "mixed signals" on
whether it believes a marketing loan for soybeans could be
successfully challenged in GATT by the EC, Haggard said.
    While the ASA position is to support a 5.02 dlrs per bu
loan rate combined with a marketing loan, Haggard also endorsed
a proposal by Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., which would set a six
dlrs per bu loan rate and apply a marketing loan.
    The Huckaby proposal is also supported by the ranking
Republican on the House Agriculture committee, Rep. Edward
Madigan of Illinois.
    Subcommittee chairman Glickman endorsed the need to take
some action on soybeans, but cautioned that the marketing loan
could mean a substantial increase in budget costs.
    Glickman noted that the Agriculture Committee must cut one
to 1.5 billion dlrs from its fiscal 1988 budget and therefore
must fit any soybean program changes into the overall budget.
    Haggard said at a soybean loan rate of six dlrs per bu
combined with a marketing loan, the U.S. soybean price might
fall to four dlrs per bu initially. This would cost the
government a maximum of two billion dlrs. But he said the costs
would decline as market prices recovered.

Whether the European Community's

an EC official said.
    "It is very far from certain that it will go through," Sir

    Denman noted Britain remains opposed to the plan and West
Germany has opposed it in the past.
    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has threatened
retaliation if the tax is approved, as it would limit U.S.
soybean exports to the EC. Council action is expected soon.
    Denman said while the EC is willing to negotiate about
agriculture in a new round of trade talks, it is unwilling to
single out export subsidies on a negotiating agenda or put
agricultural policy on a special fast track.
    "The key to a solution in this area seems to me not in the
framing of the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)
wording...but in tackling government subsidies to farmers on
both sides of the Atlantic," he said.

Total food aid needs in 69 of the
least developed countries declined in 1986/87, as requirments
fell in many countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, the
U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    In a summary of its World Agriculture Report, the
department said grain production in sub-Saharan Africa was a
record high in 1986, with gains in almost every country.
    However, food needs in Central America rose, worsened by
drought-reduced crops and civil strife.
    Record wheat production in 1986/87 is pushing global wheat
consumption for food to a new high, and higher yielding
varieties have been particularly effective where spring wheat
is a common crop, it said.
    However, may developing countries in tropical climates,
such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central
America, are not well adapted for wheat production, and
improved varieties are not the answer to rising food needs, the
department said.
    World per capita consumption of vegetable oil will rise in
1986/87 for the third straight year.
    Soybean oil constitutes almost 30 pct of vegetable oil
consumption, while palm oil is the most traded, the department

Congress should give the U.S.
Agriculture Secretary the authority to keep the 1987 soybean
loan rate at the current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushel
in order to help resolve the problem of soybean export
competitiveness, USDA undersecretary Dan Amstutz said.
    Speaking to reporters following a Senate Agriculture
Appropriations hearing, Amstutz suggested that one way out of
the current soybean program "dilemma" would be for Congress to
allow the loan rate to remain at 4.56 dlrs. He indicated if the
loan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then consider ways to make
U.S. soybeans more competitive such as using certificates to
further buydown the loan rate.
    Under current law, the 1987 soybean loan rate cannot be
less than 4.77 dlrs per bu.
    Amstutz' suggestion would be for Congress to change the
farm bill to allow USDA to leave the soybean loan rate at 4.56
dlrs in crop year 1987 rather than increase it to 4.77 dlrs.
    The 1986 effective loan rate is 4.56 dlrs because of the
4.3 pct Gramm-Rudman budget cut.
    Amstutz stressed that a major factor in any decision on
soybean program changes will be the budget costs.
    He told the hearing that the problem in soybeans is that
the U.S. loan rate provides an "umbrella" to foreign production
and causes competitive problems for U.S. soybeans.
    Asked about the American Soybean Association's request for
some form of income support, Amstutz said "the competitive
problem is the most severe." He said USDA is still studying the
situation and "no resolution" has yet been found.

U.S. corn acreage this year is 
likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassed
acreage reductions of the 1983 PIK year and could rank as one
of the lowest corn plantings in the United States in sixty
years, Agriculture Department officials said.
    USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31.
Agriculture Department analysts said next week's figures will
likely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres,
down 22 pct from last year's plantings of 83.3 mln acres.
    Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings, U.S. corn
production will also decrease significantly. Analysts said 1987
corn production could drop by over one billion bushels to
around seven billion bushels.
    Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grains
program, along with 1.9 mln acres enrolled in the conservation
program, will cause acreage to plummet, Department feedgrain
analysts said.
    "There's no question that there will be a sharp decrease in
corn acreage," one said. "It's difficult for any farmer to not
go along with the program this year."
    Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year but
at a much slower rate of around four pct, USDA analysts said.
    Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below, they
said, compared to last year's level of 61.5 mln acres.
    If analysts' unofficial estimates prove correct then the
drop in u.s. corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 when
farmers idled 22 mln acres in the Payment-In-Kind program.
    Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983. A
severe drought that summer in major producing states caused
yields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4.2
billion bushels.
    Given normal weather conditions this year, USDA analysts
said the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billion
bushels, down from last year's crop of 8.3 billion bushels.
    "This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significant
reduction in production," an analyst said.
    A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual U.S.
corn usage, so surplus stocks, while not decreasing, would not
increase significantly, a specialist said.
    High producing corn belt states are expected to show the
greatest acreage reductions, based upon historical
participation in government programs, analysts said.
    In contrast, soybean acreage is likely to be cut the most
in marginal producing areas of the southeast and the western
corn belt, a USDA soybean analyst said.
    "Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge,"
he said. Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts in
higher-producing delta areas.
    Soybean production could drop fractionally from last year's
2.0 billion bushels to 1.8 to 1.9 billion, he said.
    U.S. soybean acreage, after soaring to 71.4 mln acres in
1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that, has
steadily declined in the 1980's.
    U.S. corn acreage, with the exception of 1983, has been in
the low to mid 80-mln acre range for the past 10 years. The
highest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA has
kept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mln
acres and obtained average yields of 26.5 bushels per acre.
    Last year U.S. farmers obtained record corn yields
averaging 119.3 bushels per acre.
    "We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billion
bushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so," an analyst said.
    Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres as
long as government program provisions remain the same, analysts
said.
    Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required to
set aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligible
for payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15
pct of their acreage.
    "To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres, we would have to
provide more incentives," an analyst said.

Argentine grain producers again
reduced their estimates for the total yield of the 1986/87
soybean crop, which will begin to be harvested in mid-April,
trade sources said.
    They said growers now forecast soybean production this
season at between 7.5 and 7.8 mln tonnes, down from last week's
estimate of 7.7 to eight mln tonnes and the 8.0 to 8.4 mln
tonnes forecast in mid-February.
    The new forecast is still higher than last season's record
total production.
    Private sources put 1985/86 production at a record 7.2 to
7.3 mln tonnes -- 4.2 to 6.4 pct lower than the new forecast
for the current crop. The official figure for 1985/86 is 7.1
mln tonnes, 5.6 to 9.9 pct below this season's new estimates.
    Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean pods
in the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe
provinces and northern Buenos Aires.
    The crop since January has been hit by high temperatures
and inadequate rainfall. Growers fear they may find more empty
pods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield.
    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 to
3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct higher than the 1985/86
record of 3.34 mln hectares.
    The state of the crop continued to be good in general until
last week but intense, heavy rains since could have caused
damage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm.
    Where the rains were less heavy they were considered
beneficial although too late to improve yield estimates.
    The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops in
southern Buenos Aires province but are not expected to
influence production forecasts.
    In other areas, especially western Buenos Aires, where
rainfall was more than 200 mm, parts of the sunflower, maize
and sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged.
    The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week by
rains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba, La
Pampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios.
    The area sown with maize this season was between 3.58 and
3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln
hectares in 1985/86.
    The yield of 1986/87 maize continued to be forecast at
between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes.
    This estimate is 19.8 to 20.2 pct lower than the 12.4 to
12.6 mln tonnes at which private sources put 1985/86 production
and 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the official 12.8 mln tonnes.
    The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of the
area sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Aires
although at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods.
    A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage is
impossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days of
sunshine dries the fields.
    The area sown this season was 2.0 to 2.2 mln hectares, down
29.9 to 36.3 pct on last year's record 3.14 mln hectares.
    Sunflowerseed 1986/87 production is still forecast at 2.3
to 2.6 mln tonnes, 34.1 to 41.5 pct below the 1985/86 record of
4.1 mln tonnes.
    The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by the
rains, advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and starting
in La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown.
    The area sown was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2
pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares the previous season.
    Yield estimates remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, 16.7 to
22 pct down on 1985/86 production of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.

U.S. soybean lobbyists and
congressional aides criticized a proposal from a senior
Agriculture Department official that Congress allow the U.S.
soybean loan level to be officially lowered to 4.56 dlrs per
bushel next year.
    "I don't know who in Congress would propose that happening.
Politically it would be totally unacceptable," an aide to a
senior farm-state senator said.
    USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said this week that
Congress should give USDA authority to keep the soybean loan 
at its current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushel rather
than increasing it to its minimum allowed level of 4.77 dlrs.
    "I'm convinced that Congress will not go along with this,"
American Soybean Association President Dave Haggard said.
    Amstutz told reporters following a senate hearing that if
the soybean loan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then consider
ways to make U.S. soybeans more competitive.
    His comments were seen as possibly indicating what the  the
administration's position is in the debate over what should be
done to make soybeans competitive and at the same time protect
soybean farmers' income.
    Using soybean specific certificates to further buydown the
loan rate or implementation of a marketing loan have been
pointed to as the most effective ways to get soybean prices
competitive. USDA secretary Richard Lyng, however, continues to
maintain his opposition to a marketing loan, saying such a move
would be too costly.
    "There will be alot of other options that will be
considered before Congress looks at that one (the Amstutz
proposal," said Bill O'Conner, aide to Rep. Edward Madigan
(R-Ill), ranking minority leader of the Agriculture Committee.
    "Anybody representing large groups of soybean producers
would not be very excited about supporting a lower soybean
loan," O'Conner said.
    Congress may very likely look at the soybean loan and
decide that they cannot increase it from its current 5.02 dlr
basic rate, but that there has to be something mandated to
increase soybean's competitiveness, David Graves, aide to Sen.
Thad Cochran (R-Miss) said. Cochran, a staunch supporter of a
soybean marketing loan, would support a soybean loan of 5.02 or
4.77 dlrs with a certificate buydown, Graves said.
