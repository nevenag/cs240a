11830	A proposed sales tax on gold transactions could put a damper on the Tokyo market and encourage a shift of trading to Hong Kong and Singapore senior vice president and Tokyo branch manager of Credit Suisse Paul Hofer told a press conference If you impose five pct on both buy and sell transactions Tokyo participants in the gold market could be out of business he said The tax would create such a spread that Japanese would be unable to compete in the international market he added How can the government really raise taxes if the system they impose is prohibitive of generating business he said The government now imposes a 15 pct tax on physical trades exceeding 37500 yen for gold jewellery and coins and a 25 yen tax per 10000 yen on futures transactions gold dealers said The new five pct tax would be imposed on companies trading more than 100 mln yen a year and apply to paper gold trades gold deposits with banks and trading of gold bars as well as that of jewellery and coins dealers said However the tax would lower the rate on jewellery and coins to only five pct from the current 15 pct they said Hofer said in 1982 Switzerland had imposed a 56 pct gold turnover tax on Jan 1 1980 but abolished it on Oct 1 1986 A study by one of the Swiss banks showed that in early 1980 the first year of the tax the volume for all Swiss banks fell by up to 25 pct compared with 1978 and 1979 Hofer said Transactions of paper gold also fell up to 75 pct of the volume prior to imposition of the tax he said While gold transactions in Switzerland decreased the volume of trades outside the country particularly in London and Luxembourg increased between 10-25 pct Hofer said Japan is a major importer of gold buying a yearly average just under 200 tonnes gold dealers said Last year Japan imported about 600 tonnes of gold but the government had bought about 300 tonnes for minting coins to commemorate the 60th year of Emperor Hirohitos reign dealers said Gold trading in Tokyo is dominated mainly by Japanese trading companies while Credit Suisse is the major foreign participant Daily turnover in the Tokyo spot market ranges between one and 10 tonnes with the average around three tonnes while futures turnover amounts to about four tonnes gold dealers said All of us are concerned daily with the fact that the Tokyo market is growing that Japan is becoming one of the three major financial markets in the world  And in my personal opinion I think it would be a very big mistake to put a damper on this positive growth or developments by imposing such a tax Hofer said I dont think it fits the philosophy of an internationalising market he added Officials of several major Japanese trading houses attending the press conference said they supported Credit Suisses call for the government not to impose the gold tax

7088	A new market has emerged in warrants to buy gold a vehicle which bankers say brings some of the play of commodity options into the field of securities Over the past three weeks Swiss offices of American banks have launched a total of four issues of warrants with varying conditions drawing on renewed inflationary worries and the recovery of the gold price last year And Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse-First Boston each issued Swiss franc bonds with warrants for gold which have a similar character though they are aimed at a less professional market The market is still small Taken together the four American-led warrant issues raised only about 50 mln Swiss francs But banks believe the vehicle meets a need of investors and predicted a lively future Andrew Barrett of Citicorp Investment Bank Switzerland AG said The warrants give smaller investors a chance to have a long-term investment in gold with limited risk Citicorp in Zurich launched the first of these warrants on February 27 following it up with a second issue less than a week later The issuer in both cases was Citibank NA The idea found some quick copies Goldman Sachs in Zurich organized and co-led an issue for the Swiss branch of Banque Indosuez on March 9 and last night Morgan Guaranty Switzerland AG did another for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York The four issues now offer investors striking prices for gold ranging from the Indosuez issue at 410 dlrs an ounce the same price as the underlying commodity to a 430 dlr level on the first one for Citibank The premiums range from 22 pct to 36 pct and maturities from 18 months to four years and three months in all cases longer than gold futures and options on US Markets The bankers traced the inspiration for the market back to the February report of US Consumer prices for January when a jump of 07 pct raised again the threat of inflation Many people are worried about inflation again said Mats Joensson of Goldman Sachs Money supply in Germany and the United States has grown very strongly in the last year and people want to take a ride on gold The gold market having seen strong gains in 1986 has languished just above 400 dlrs an ounce over the past few weeks But the banks saw in warrants the vehicle for a more highly leveraged play where the downside risk was limited Barrett said it was natural that the market developed in Switzerland People here understand gold and they understand warrants he said Citicorp Switzerland pioneered warrants with a series of equity-linked covered issues based on Japanese company shares over the past two years and last autumn Swiss banks launched covered warrants in Swiss registered shares in a bid to give foreign investors a chance to play in a market otherwise closed to all but Swiss citizens and to play it with higher leverage But after a quick flurry of issues that market dried up when Swiss shares prices fell from their January peaks The issues are being marketed not on the basis of simple premiums but on implicit volatility models devised to provide scientific comparisons between titles in the options market Martin Bachem of Morgan Guaranty said his banks issue was competitive despite its relatively high premium The issue for five ounces at 425 dlrs was priced at 955 Swiss francs making a premium over the spot gold price of nearly 36 pct Using a Black Sholes options model he said the issues long 43-year maturity meant the warrants needed an implicit volatility of gold of only 245 pct for the option to pay off which he claimed was lower than the other issues But Barrett said the Black Sholes variant Citicorp used pointed to a higher volatily for the Morgan issue and emphasized that the models were at best an inexact science And each bank using its own model put the implicit volatility needed for its own issue at close to 25 pct Whatever the calculation the issues have received a warm welcome from investors Joensson of Goldman Sachs said there was a lot of demand even among small investors who were buying 15 or 20 warrants apiece The most sophisticated ones wouldnt buy these because the premiums are too high he said
