235	Indonesias agriculture sector will grow by just 10 pct in calendar 1987 against an estimated 24 pct in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or declines the US Embassy said in a report Production of Indonesias staple food rice is forecast to fall to around 263 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 2658 mln tonnes in 1986 according to the annual report on Indonesias agricultural performance The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 267 mln tonnes with a forecast 273 mln tonnes output in 1987 The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 15 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 169 mln tonnes in 1986 because of a drawdown on stocks Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane rubber and copra show little or no gain the report says The modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans palm oil and palm kernels Constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds limited fertile land insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops the report underlines The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as wereng or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties and to use lower-yielding more resistant rice types The government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee tea rubber plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 70 pct in 1987 to 145 mln tonnes from 135 mln with exports rising to an estimated 720000 tonnes from 695000 tonnes in 1986 the report says But while production of soybeans in 198788 Oct-Sept will rise to 1075 mln tonnes from 980000 in 198687 imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant The report says that imports of wheat soybeans soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last Septembers 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand The report said that Indonesias overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s It compares with 19 pct growth in 1985 and 67 pct in 1984 The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump

12754	Pakistans decision to suspend tea import licences will hurt Kenyan tea exports in the short term while exporters seek new markets sources close to Nairobi broking houses and exporters said Broking house officials in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo yesterday told Reuters Pakistan had suspended the licences in order to link tea imports to Pakistani exports The latest available figures show that Kenyan exports to Pakistan mainly tea were worth 75 mln dlrs in 1985 while imports from Pakistan amounted to only 48 mln dlrs Kenya provides over 50 pct of Pakistans tea imports The Nairobi sources said the Pakistani decision did not come as a surprise as Pakistan had been complaining of the trade imbalance for some time We are very disappointed that Pakistan took such action  it will certainly hurt Kenyas tea industry in the short term as Pakistan is Kenyas second largest market a source at one broking house told Reuters One tea broker said Pakistans move had already affected Kenyas tea trade and was largely responsible for an average fall of two shillings a kilo at the export auction in Mombasa last Monday The trend is likely to continue until other countries replace Pakistan which usually buys all qualities of our tea he added Kenya has for a long time relied on Britain Pakistan Egypt and to a lesser extent the United States as major markets for its tea the sources added Small-scale exporters who export mainly to Pakistan would be worst hit by the Pakistani move as it would take them longer to find new outlets they said
12907	Abnormally high levels of radiation were found in Soviet tea and hazelnuts more than nine months after the Chernobyl nuclear accident West German residents in Moscow were advised this week In a letter to the West German community here Ambassador Joerg Kastl said laboratory tests on food samples bought in Moscow in February had shown elevated levels of caesium-134 and -137 in tea from Azerbaijan and Ukrainian hazelnuts Other food samples sent for testing at Cologne University including honey fruit vegetables pork milk and butter were found to be free of radiation it said Data in the letter showed the tea and hazelnuts contained caesium levels far in excess of ceilings recommended by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation FAO The letter said people who had consumed the tea faced no particular health danger as most of the caesium remained in the tea leaves but it warned against eating the hazelnuts The products sent for testing were bought in state shops and private farmers markets in Moscow it added Other Western embassies in Moscow said they had discontinued laboratory testing of Soviet food late last year because no abnormal radiation levels were detected We didnt find anything so we stopped doing it a US Embassy spokesman said A British spokesman said radiation-monitoring equipment remained in the embassy waiting room for British residents in Moscow who wanted to check their food but laboratory tests had not been conducted for several months Earlier we sent some food back to Britain as a precautionary measure but we stopped in the absence of any alarming signals he said If the tests had shown abnormal readings they would have been resumed
7545	Three geographically diverse droughts in Asia are being linked by some scientists to a reintensification of the complex and little-understood El Nino weather pattern ltAccu-Weather Inc a commercial weather forecasting service said Rice and wheat farmers in China wheat and sugarcane growers in Australia and tea planters in Sri Lanka all face serious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrive in time to break the droughts offical reports government officials and meteorologists said Wen Wei Po a Hong Kong daily with close Peking links said the drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinces have been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months Rice planting is threatened in eight provinces it added Rainfall in the key farming provinces of Henan and Sichuan was 70 pct below average during February the lowest figure for over 20 years the paper said The dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pct compared with last March and lowered the water levels of many rivers it added This has resulted in reduced hydro-electric power causing shortages to industry and households The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century causing many ships to run aground Wen Wei Po said Unusually high temperatures have also been reported across China media reports said The Peoples Daily said Sichuan has recorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than average since early February The New China News Agency said the average December temperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higher than last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984 Severe drought is affecting about one-third of Sri Lanka and threatens to reduce the countrys tea crop Ministry of Plantation Industries officials told Reuters In Australia concern is growing about below-average rainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along the Queensland coast and in Western Australias wheat belt local Meteorological Bureau officials said For many farmers and government officials the fear is that while the present low rainfall does not yet pose a major threat the prospect of a dry autumnwinter season when the wheat crop is in its early stages certainly does they added Concern is heightened by the memory of the 198283 drought which devastated the wheat crop and coincided with the occurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known as El Nino they said Although meteorologists are cautious about linking the Asia-Pacific regions disrupted weather patterns to any single cause El Ninos role is being closely studied they said Accu-Weather Inc which specialises in providing data for agriculture and shipping interests said each El Nino event was unique The El Nino does not always produce the same effects and the present occurrence is much less pronounced than the last major event in 198283 it said El Nino Spanish for Christ Child because it appears around Christmas is formed by the action of warm air bearing clouds and rain shifting from the Indonesian archipelago to the coast of Peru where it mingles with the cold waters associated with the Peru current and returns across the Pacific as the trade winds meteorologists said The winds strengthened by El Ninos pump effect raise the sea level off Australia and Indonesia they said When the winds drop the ocean seeking equilibrium sends a surge of warmer water back across the Pacific where it collides with the cold seas off Peru they said One effect of this heat exchange is to deflect the rain-bearing clouds away from Australia and Indonesia into the Pacific where they further disrupt other weather patterns The prospects for an end to the droughts vary Accu-Weather said China where the affected areas have received between 40 and 75 pct of normal rainfall will have to wait for the May-September rains it said The May-September rains normally provide the drought-striken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall In Australia areas of Queenslands coastal strip have received less than half the normal rainfall during the current wet season but prospects for increased rains are diminishing as the rainy season draws to an end In Sri Lanka the drought has come when rainfall should be at its maximum for the year The years secondary rains usually occur between April and June although it is not possible at this stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual
