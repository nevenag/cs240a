(this is no sin, I know next tonothing about it either) I mean, anything other than this "10^50" probability thing which you got wrong in the first post.The speculation involved is really your own, isn't it? How much _biology_do you know, even apart from abiogenesis? Any classes past high school?Read Chris Colby's FAQ? How much paleontology, geology, etc do you know?Or are you speculating that its all speculative? Do you have any basisupon which to imply that to keep an "open mind" one must allow thatthe earth, universe, and all the creatures in it could have been created~10,000 years ago? None of this is intended as a flame. To say thatyou don't know a subject is _not_ the same as calling you an idiot. Idon't know _much_ about these areas, but then I am not the onecalling into question all of mainstream science. In other words, wheredo you get off calling it speculative unless by this you also mean thatall of physics, chemistry, etc are also speculative in some sense?You may have, in fact, not been implying that the rejection of creationismis a sign of close-mindedness, or that the theory of evolution is especiallyspeculative, in which case I have merely misinterpretedyou.

No, but you would need a lot of background reading in sociology to getto a point where the discussion would be focused enough to be helpful.The interaction of values and behavior among people has been a majordefining element of both psychology and sociology for a century now, andis the part of both disciplines (as social psychology) that strikes meas most relevant to the various naive arguments about morality on thenet.An exceptionally good place to get a clear view of "social norms" inaction is the "micro" sociology of Ervin Goffman.  There are some verygood introductory essays ("Deference and Demeanor" is a classic), aswell as accessible books like _Interaction Ritual_.  More difficult andtheoretical are some of his later books like _Frame Analysis_.  But evenat his most academic, Goffman escapes the dreadful boredom and heavilyjargon-laden theorizing that makes most standard sociology unreadable.Morality is essentially the playing out of individual goals and aims inthe setting of their expectations of other people, and others' expectationsof them.  This becomes "systematized" in a "socially mandated" way simplybecause otherwise we'd have to invent the entire context of interpersonalrealtions with every single interaction -- and we engage in social inter-actions usually hundreds or thousands of times a day, so that a renego-tiation of human interaction each time is a pretty ridiculous notion.We simply learn it (most of it) early, along with language (which is oneof the main exemplars.)--Michael L.

Bruce hits the main point simply -- as Russell Turpin does in more detailin his response.  *All* sources are, in modern historiography, to be usedcritically, which is simply to say that any claims deriving from them aresubject to *specific* examination in the light of motives and other HUMANconsiderations (as well as the physical background).  The critical methodapplies BOTH to the original document AND to the uses made of it by others(most emphatically *including* the historical researchers themselves.)>wouldn't they be a better "reporter" than someone who heard about it second >hand?  I guess isn't firsthand better than second hand.  I know, there is bias,>and winners writing history, but doesn't the principle of firsthand being best>still apply?But given the critical principle, what evidence is there that we haveANYTHING at ALL from "firsthand" sources about Jesus?  Paul's letters areindeed firsthand evidence ABOUT PAUL and his interactions.  They are, asa result, the most historically solid books in the NT.  Paul's claims anddescriptions about his conflicts with Jerusalem may not be "wie es eigent-lich gewesen" -- but they are most definitely the comments of a participant!In other words, we'd evaluate Paul's statements more or less as we wouldthe testimony of a witness in court.The gospels are another story altogether.  Luke is most assuredly NOT afirsthand witness.  He *claims* to have gathered material that is closerto the actual events -- but this is a conventional claim in ancient booksand Luke in fact NEVER NAMES a witness or points to any one thing in hisbook(s) which derive from any source *we* can detect behind Luke.  Johnhas a concluding remark that it derives from the testimony of a beloveddisciple (who is NOT named.)  We are not bound to accept this claim (fora long time, some scholars rejected it outright), but even if we do, itmakes the fourth gospel as we have it *at best* secondhand.  Neither Marknor Matthew make any claims to be firsthand.  Later (much later) Christiantradition associates the first gosple with Matthew and a possible Aramaicproto-gospel, and associates Mark with Peter as having something like thesame second-hand status of recounting Peter's preaching of the gospel.Such traditional claims run into difficulties if we try to evaluate theactual data before us.  Luke and Matthew both appear to use (differently!)an anonymous and not otherwise attested collection of _logoi_ (words anddeeds) of Jesus, as well as to be dependent on Mark.  This makes theirtestimony AT LEAST thirdhand.All that said, historians DO attempt to glean whatever they can from theNT sources, and they are overwhelmingly the obvious and best sources foranything about the earliest Church.  They are also *extremely* importantfor the light they cast (however refracted through Christian biases) onthe sectarian world of Judaism just before and around the time of thedestruction of the 2nd Temple.The problem of "the historical Jesus" is tricky, however.  There is acycle of fashion on this (and we are now near a major "high" in peoplethinking they *can* discern [with historico-critical plausibility] some-thing about Jesus' life and opinions from the NT.  The difficulty here(which dominated thinking 50 years ago, and will probably return to favorin another generation :-)) was pointed out by Bultmann, after Schweitzer'streatment at the end of the previous high-point on the cycle -- simplyBECAUSE all our sources have passed through AT LEAST one layer of quiteanonymous shaping WITHIN the early Church, we have no easy and reliableway to distribute ANY part of the material between "real" history and theinventions of the Church.  There are few "radical skeptics" who think wehave nothing of history in the gospels [though such a position can bemaintained], but neither have we any tools that can distinguish "shaping"of real historical material by its communal use as opposed to "invention."--Michael L.

I was accessing nn from another system and that might have caused the glitch.I hold that an objective moral system exists regardless of my knowledge or application of it.  I relate it to the idea that there is scientific truth that is truth even though I may not know about it.  Some morals I wouldn't want to change, and would not consider it progress fora society to oneday say that rape and murder are ok.  Some underlying themes (morality, honesty, courage, respect, etc.) are used to base actions.  I don't consider the idea that we should have been moral, should be moral now, and should be so in the future a limitation, when it includes such morality.  Aberrances in a moral system, i.e. it is immoral to marrysomeone of the opposite sex, it is immoral to listen to rock and roll, etc. seem to be different than the above lists, and if specific actions are givenmoral status I tend to question those morals.MAC >-- >  Disclaimer?

If wecan't measure anything objectively, then the answers we get from physicsaren't objective either.  That's what I mean when I say there's no objectivephysics.Sure, we can all agree that (say) F = GMm/r^2, but that's maths.  It's onlyphysics when you relate it to the real world, and if we can't do thatobjectively, we're stuck.

Yes, we call that experimental error, but it's notreally "error" in the conventional sense; in fact, if you don't get any,that's an error :-)You could argue that the value of c is "objective, to within +/- <somevalue>".

The appearance that there is onecomes from attempting to use a coordinate system that doesn't map properly(physically) in this geometry, rather analogous to the "singularity" atthe North and South Poles of the Earth when using Latitude and Longitudelines.  Such "singular" behavior as the earlier post suggested (infinitetime to reach the horizon) is a mathematical artifact of the wrong choiceof coordinates.  As Paul says, in the object's frame of reference,it WILL hit the horizon in finite time, and then plunge to the singularity(that IS a "real" singularity) in a (short, for "small" holes) further finite amount of time.Not only that, but to an OUTSIDE observer, an object that falls into a blackhole disappears in a finite time also, in spite of the relativistic "slow-down" that intuition suggests.  This is because any light emitted by theobject as it falls (or is shone onto it by a separate "flashlight") consistsof individual, FINITE quanta, and only a finite number of these can reachthe object before it plunges through the horizon.  These will be succesivelymore red-shifted, true, but only a finite number of them will hit the object,and following ones will be too late to interact with the object until they,too, are inside the horizon (and thus cannot come out).This reddening, dimming and disappearance is exponentially fast, as the object approaches the horizon, when you do the math.As Paul says, this is discussed in Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler's book "Gravity" where they talk about the appropriatness (sp?) of the term "black hole" and the inappropriatness (sp?) of an older term: "frozen star", which was used earlier in this century before all the implications of black-hole theory were understood.

Gravity, too, isvery much a theory; no gravity waves have even been detected, but wehave a very useful model that describes much of the behavior onobjects by this thing we _call_ gravity.  Gravity, however, is _not_ a fact.  It is a theoretical model used to talk about how objects behave in our physical environment.  Newton thought gravity was asimple vector force; Einstein a wave.

Cases in which their mental capacity is imnpaired.   Casesin which they err about the true value of what they are selling.Pretty soon you have to start talking about "informed owner""competent owner" "educated owner" and so on, and the conceptgets less and less clear and exceptions more and more plausible.But the real problem remains that of looking only at end-pointsin a context.    Maybe most of us will agree with you that a pebble is "small" and that the Moon is "big", but that does not mean thatyou have an objective measuring scale.   Only that these two are fairly common opinions *in context*.An astronomer may claim that the Moon is actually "tiny" anda micro-biologist may remark that a pebble is "huge".   Similarly,if an armed Serbian offers a helpless Bosnian a dollar and his life for his land, rather than killing him and taking it for free, the Bosnian may consider that he is getting quite a good deal.jon.

[deletions]Jim - we essentially agree, except about the definition of "fact."The scientific definition of "fact" is not "the ultimate truth," butrather "a theory which is so supported by evidence and so predictivethat it is pointless to test it anymore."So, we have the fact of evolution and we have theories of evolution(just as we have the fact of gravity and theories of gravity, andthe fact of the atomic nature of matter and atomic theory).  The factof evolution is that the current diversity of life arose throughcommon descent:  this is so supported by the evidence that no one everbothers to try to test it anymore.  Theories of evolution includetheories regarding the mechanism of common descent (natural selectionvs. drift) or the actual "pathways" of evolution, or any number ofother things.  These are constantly being tested, because the actualmechanisms, etc, behind the fact of common descent are still up forquestion.Note that the fact of evolution is still a theory.  In other words, itcould, theoretically, still be falsified and rejected.  But since it'sso predictive, and so consistently supported by evidence, it seemspointless to explicitly try to falsify it anymore.[description of atomic theory, and alternative theories of gravity, deleted]>Both are very useful models that >have no religious overtones or requirements of faith, unless of course you >want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly >the way the theory now formulated talks about it.Here is where you fail to make an important distinction.

Inmany types of|> experiments the "prediction" is that the observed phenomena willhappen again|> and be capable of being observed. For example, in chemistry someonemay predict|> the outcome of a chemical reaction and then actually observe thatreaction|> repeatedly.There are several problems here. First, you are discussing onlyexperimental procedures. Observational procedures are also useful.  Themain criterion is attempting to verify an idea by using it to makeprediction about as-yet unmade observations. The observations could bethe result of an experiment, or they could be obsevations of activityoccuring spontaneossly in nature, or they could even be observations ofthe lasting results of events long past. All that matters is that theobservations be *new*.  This is what prediction is about in science -it is*not* about predicting the future except in this very restrictedsense.Secondly, repeatability can also take many forms.  It is really justtherequirement that independent observers be able to verify the results.Theobservation of a fossil is 'repeatable', since any qualified observermaylook at it (this is why the specimens are reqtined in a museum).  Also,there is the implicit prediction that future fossil finds willcorrespondto the current one.  New fossils are found often enough that this istested regularly.  Many times a new fossil actually falsifies someconclusion made on the basis of previous fossils.Unfortunately for you, the models that were falsified have alway beenperipheral to the model of evolution we now have.  (For instance, thefront legs of Tyrannosaurus rex turned out to have tremendous muscles,rather than being weakly endowed as previously believed).So, in fact, histoircal science findings *are* repeatable in thenecessary sense.  Just becuase you cannot go out and repeat theoriginalevent does *not* make it impossible to make valid observations.[This is not to say that biologists would not go coo-coo if extra-terrestrial life were discovered - that could make the determinationof the process of abiogenesis relatively easy].--sarima@teradata.com                     (formerly tdatirv!sarima)  orStanley.Friesen@ElSegundoCA.ncr.comsarima@teradata.com(formerly tdatirv!sarima)  orStanley.Friesen@ElSegundoCA.ncr.com

It'sobvious from even a cursory study of history that no system,regardless of the authority it may claim for its basis, will makepeople act any better. Until human nature changes, the products of ournature won't change, and that has to include society. I think yourassessment of human potential in this regard is too optimistic.   What is needed is an absolute moral standard if -all- people are tocreate any Utopias. By implying a Utopian future, you also argue foran absolute standard that applies to everyone in every case.

The point is that when we recognize these "instantiations" of mathematicalsystems, we do so because we VALUE being able to describe and perhaps even to control these instantiations. There is always a driving purpose behindthought -- a motive, if you will. Sometimes that motive is relatively "pure", e.g. pursuit of knowledge, othertimes it's "impure", e.g. pursuitof money, or of physical pleasure. But it's always there. And even when itis a "pure" pursuit of knowledge, presumably one pursues knowledge in orderto personally grow, develop, advance to a higher plane of being. So thereis still an element of acquisition, of reaching, of grasping, even in theapproach of the "detached, objective" scientist. >>Now if we're valuing procedures subjectively, and science is a procedure,>>science cannot be valued non-subjectively.

There are two sensesin which we can say that the phenomenon of "the working of the DES chip" is value-based:1) Because there is bound to be some reason why we built the DES   chip and started it running in the first placeand2) Because the very notion/definition/concept of "works" has value   associated with itThe first is a CAUSAL linkage -- we want it to work, therefore we CAUSE it to work. That is rather a mundane interpretation. The second, however, is a more subtle and deeper PHENOMENOLOGICAL linkage -- that the attribute "works" is itself, as everything else, presented to the human consciousness as a _valued_ fact, not just a fact-in-itself. You are perhaps justified in shooting down the causal linkage, but you have not begun to address the phenomenological linkage.>Suns in unpopulated solar systems shine without being blessed by your>values.

I'm looking for a way to say>"yes" to that question, and relativism isn't it.Almost invariably when considering the relative value of one thingover another, be it morals or consequences, people only consider thoseaspects which justify a desired action or belief.  In justifying acommitement to peace I might argue that it lets people live long &healthy and peaceful lives.  While that much may well be true, it isincomplete in ignoring the benefits of war - killing off the mostagressive member of society, trimming down the population, stimulatingproduction.

Morality is not a necessity for a functionalcollection of peoples, just a set of acceptable behaviours (is this the samething?).  There is no universal moral standard as there are many differentsituations in which collections of social organisms find themselves. Somespecies of bees see nothing wrong with kicking out a large number of malebees because they are being a burden on the food supplies of the colony. Thebees die of course, but it was for the good of the colony as a whole, so wasit immoral? Our society (at least our western one) is one of abundance when it comes tothe basics; food, water and shelter.  Therefore our moral standards arebased upon those circumstances.  Unfortunately we enforce our moralstandards on collections of peoples who are not in similar situations,because we believe in some "universal morality".  What I am saying is that,yes, you CAN still murder my sibling, but don't expect your peers to beimpressed by it in our society. However in some other circumstances, it mayactually be a "moral" thing to do (in which case it wouldn't be calledmurder, probably sacrifice). After the act, you could say what you liked,but you must make a conscious decision on whether or not your society willcondone your act, so as to evaluate the consequences to yourself, includinghow you will feel about it (remember your feelings have been sociallyimbued).Jeff.I keep trying to write a book of ideas in two paragraphs and it just comesout disorganised garble!

Before going much further on that thread,I would suggest that you take a closer look at the veriety of worldreligions out there, though. There are athiestic religions as well astheistic religions. There are religions that claim knowledge aboutsuch things as an afterlife, and there are religions that make no suchclaims. My perspective is that lots of people talk, but all that means is thattalk is cheap. When someone gives me substantial evidence about anafterlife, then I'll start believing in one.

The viewpoint I follow -- that there is in general no> punishment for apostasy -- is _very_ strongly supported by Qur'an and> hadith.  This is very well shown in the book "Punishment in Islamic Law"> by Mohamed S. El-Awa (American Trust Publications, 1981).> I reiterate that I would agree with you that there is littlejustification for the punishment of apostasy in the Qur'an.In Islamic history, as well, apostasy has rarely been punished. Belief is considered a matter of conscience and since thereis to be no compulsion in the matter of belief, apostates havebeen generally left to believe or not believe as they will.However, when an apostate makes attacks upon "God andHis Messenger" the situation changes. Now the charge ofapostasy may be complicated with other charges - perhaps charges of sedition, treason, spying, etc. If the person makes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts publicattacks (as opposed to arguement) against Islam, thesituation is likewise complicated. If the person spreadsslander or broadcasts falsehoods, again the situationchanges. The punishments vary according to the situationthe apostate is in. Anyhow, the charge of aggravatedapostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie's case.There is a distinction in the Qur'an between a formal war situationand being in the situation where someone unilaterallywages war (by their actions), creates disorder, makes mischief,etc. against the Muslims and creates a situation that results in harm to Muslims. Here, a small group or even a single individual couldbe said to be engaged in such a practise. In other words, there isa clear difference between a formal war situation (where twoclearly defined parties wage war, conclude treaties, exchangeprisoners, etc.), and dealing with attacks that come from isolatedindividuals or groups against Islam. It is the second situation, the unilateral attack and the spreading of "fasad" that would apply in the case of Rushdie.The matter of Rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an offensive book (banning the book is secondary) -a full set of circumstances following the publication ofthe book come into play as well, including the deaths of manyMuslims, and Rushdie's (and his publishers) Media games.> Now, I do not believe in _blindly_ following anyone, no matter> how knowledgeable he or she may be in Islamic law.

I believethat one of the Qur'anic verses on which the fatwa is based is 5:33.Every verse in the Qur'an has a corresponding "circumstance ofrevelation" but in no way is the understanding (the tafsir) of theverse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstancein which it was revealed. If this was the case then we could saythat all the laws and regulations that were revealed when theMuslims were NOT involved in conflict, should be suspended whenthey were at war. The logic does not follow. In complex, real-lifesituations, there may be many verses and many hadiths which canall be related to a single, complicated situation. The internalrelationships between these verses may be quite complex, such thatarriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and howeach applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task.It is not necessarily a simple "this or that" process. There maybe many parameters involved, there may be a larger context inwhich a particular situation should be viewed. All these mattersimpinge on the situation.In other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the Qur'an.The Qur'an asks us to reflect on its verses, but this reflection mustentail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith.If the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety, then eachperson has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that.However, if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain totheState, to the gestation of laws and rulings, to the gestation of society,the dispensing of justice, the guidance of the community, then there are certain minimum requirements of understanding that one should achieve. Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq(a.s.) relates some of these requirements, as taught by the Prophet(S.A.), in a hadith:"...he who does not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogatingverse from the abrogated one, and a specific one from a general one,and a decisive from an ambiguous; and does not differentiate betweena permission and an obligation, and does not recognize a verse ofMeccan period from a Medinite one, and does not know the circumstances of revelation, and does not understand the technical words ofthe Qur'an (whether simple or compound); and does not comprehend theknowledge of decree and measure, and is ignorant of advancing anddelaying (in its verses); and does not distinguish the clear fromthe deep, nor the manifest from the esoteric, nor the beginningfrom the termination; and is unaware of the question and the answer,the disjoining and the joining, and the exceptions and the all-inclusive,and is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains thesubsequent one; and is unaware of the emphasized subject and thedetailed one, the obligatory laws and the permissions, the places of theduties and rules, and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful; anddoes not know the joined words, and the words that are related to thosecoming before them, or after them - then such a man does not knowthe Qur'an; nor is he among the people of the Qur'an....".Based on these and other hadiths, and in accordance with many Qur'anicverses ("Why should not a company from every group remain behind to gain profound understanding (tafaqquh) in religion and to warn people when they return to them, so that they may beware." (9:122)),a science of jurisprudence arose. The requirementsfor a person to be considered a mujtahid (one who can pronounce onmatters of law and religion) are many. I've listed a few major divisions below - there are, of course, many subdivisions within theseheadings.- Knowledge of Arabic (syntax, conjugation, roots, semantics, oratory).- Knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir.- Logic (mantiq)- A knowledge of Hadiths- A knowledge of transmitters (rijal)- Knowledge of the principles of juriprudence (Qur'an, Sunnah, Consensus,Reasoning)The study of Qur'an and sunnah for purposes of law involves:- discussion of imperatives (awamir)- discussion of negative imperatives (nawahi)- discussion of generalities and particularities (aam wa khas)- discussion of unconditional and conditional- discussion of tacit meanings- discussion of the abstract and the clear- discussion of the abrogator and the abrogatedThe principles of Application of the law involves:- principles of exemption- principles of precaution- principles of option- principles of masteryThe jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous processin pronouncing judgement on a given situation. It is not a matterof looking at one verse and one hadith. Now no one should blindly follow anyone, but there is a differencebetween blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who isclearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself. There is thefamous hadith of the Prophet (S.A.) in which he says:"The fuqaha (religious scholars) are the trustees of the Prophet, as long as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires, pleasures,and wealth of this world." The Prophet (S.A.) was asked: "O Messengerof God! How may we know if they so concern themselves?" He (S.A.) replied:"By seeing whether they follow the ruling power. If they do that, fear foryour religion and shun them." I do not yet know enough about the Imamsof the four Sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith appliesto them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them.The Prophet also refered to the fuqaha as "The fortress of Islam". My onlypoint is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls intoplay a certain amount of expertise - the specifics of this expertise is delineated in the Qur'an and hadith. Those who acquire this expertiseare praised in both the Qur'an and hadith - those who without the requisiteknowledge pronounce on matters that affect society, state, and religion are cautioned.The only reason I said anything at all about the Rushdie affair in thisgroup, is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa (that is,apostasy), was wrong. When one discusses something they should at leastbase their discussion on fact. Secondly, Khomeini was condemned as ahereticbecause he supposedly claimed to be infallible - another instance ofcreating a straw man and then beating him.> Perhaps we should take our discussion to soc.religion.islam.

So the math says that nothing can enter a black hole.It seems to me that you are mis-using physical intuition here.  My point isthat you are talking about global conditions influencing local phenomenainappropriately.  Remember that there is no such thing as a "global" frameof reference for time.  Our minds like to pretend that there is, and we imagine things like the calendar on Alpha Centaury being approx. 4 years off from ours on Earth.This is simply wrong.  There is NO global "time" which can be applied toevents on Alpha Centaury concurrently with events on Earth.  This is whatSpecial Relativity has taught us.  If I am travelling past the Earth ata high rate of speed toward A.C. I can even have a different view of the _order_ of the occurance of events on A.C. versus Earth.  Thus, the answer to the question, "what's happening on Alpha Centaury NOW?" is NOT well-defined, ifasked on Earth, until you specify all the relevant parameters such as relativevelocities and the like; AND it will have different answers for different values of these parameters.Now, in the vicinity of a black hole, the curvature of spacetime becomes important enough that this lack of a global frame of reference becomes very important.  In particular, the frame used by a distant observer is quite different from the frame appropriate to the falling object.  Our minds just don't seem able to easily deal with the idea that time itself could be behaving differently in these two locations, but the equations of relativity say that it does.  We would _like_ to say "the falling object is hoveringabove the horizon, NOW", for an object whose frame has rotated wholly "away"from ours.  In a very real sense, once the object has fallen into the holeits gone forever from our ken.  Unless you volunteer to jump in after it,that is... :-) Gene Battin battin@cyclops.iucf.indiana.edu no .sig yet

Do you claimto have an objective one?  I'll assume your answer is "yes," apologiesif not."Objective" means is that different observers will get the same results.The observers may need to be trained in the use of the system.  I'd beinterested in seeing a summary of your system, though I appreciate thatit might take a great deal of effort to put it in writing.In your post above you objected to "situational morals."  Perhaps youcould begin by explaining how you objectively set the situationalboundaries of an act, in your system.  I don't think you can do it.Here's a game we could play that would illustrate my point.  I think ofa situation, and you have to say whether it is moral or not, and why.In your move you can1) Ask me any objective question about the situation, or2) Pronounce judgement.After you have pronounced judgement, I get to add whatever context I liketo the situation, provided I don't change anything I have already said.If I can change the context to one where your objective system would givea different answer, then your system is faulty.  (Since I don't know whatyour system is, either you must write it down, or at least be consistent.)Do you think your system could pass this test?-Norman

The concepts of "right"#and "wrong" (or "correct/incorrect" or "true/false") belong to the#domain of epistemological rather than moral questions.  It makes no#sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is#legitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).##Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives#of epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation, respectively.#One can certainly ask if a percept is "right" (correct, true,#veridical) or "wrong" (incorrect, false, illusory).  But it makes little#sense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand, it is#strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can#certainly ask that question about motives.##Therefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can't be considered:#they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.True, by "correct" I mean "the thing valued is really good".

My short (e) answer is#that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue,#neither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect).

That is, many Christians insist that they CANNOT havemade any mistakes when discovering their beliefs, which amounts to sayingthat they are infallible.Impicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant, most of us willprobably agree.In short, the problem is that no matter how good your sources are, if anypart of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning,then those doctrines are suspect.  So long as your own brain is involved,there is a possibility for error.  I summarised the problem by writing "Thereis no way out of the loop."Someone called `REXLEX' has claimed that there IS a way out of the loop, buthe did not bother to explain what it was, preferring instead to paraphraseSartre, ramble about Wittgenstein, and say that the conclusion of my argumentleads to relativism.As I have explained to him before, you cannot reject an argument as falsebecause you dislike where it leads: the facts do not change just becauseyou dislike them.  `REXLEX' wrote:>  I disagree with Dr Nancy's Sweetie's conclusion because if it is> taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.However, as any first-year philosophy student can explain, what `REXLEX' haswritten does not constitute a refutation.  All he has said is that he doesnot like what I wrote -- he has done nothing at all to dispute it. *There were two sentences in `REXLEX's post that seemed relevant to thepoint at hand:>  There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be> experienced and it is verifiable.I do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience.  Ihave, for example, direct experience of adding numbers.  I don't claim tobe infallible at it -- in fact I remember doing sums incorrectly -- but Ido claim that I have direct experience of reasoning about numbers.However, once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning aboutthem, we are on much shakier ground.  That was the point of the earlierarticle.  Human brains are infested with sin, and they can only be trustedin very limited circumstances.>  It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be absolute> about a thing.But how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops, and your ownreasoning begins, possibility for error appears.For example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations include aperfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, and that Jesus said,exactly, "This is my body."We'll presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutelytrue.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, thepossibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We donot have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking ofTran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn't say.  We interpret this passageusing our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we knowthat our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (Thisis something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)Why should anyone believe that his reasoning -- which he knows to befallible -- can lead him to perfect conclusions?So, given the assumptions in this example, what we can be certain of isthat Jesus said "This is my body."  Beyond that, once we start making updoctrines and using our brains to reason about what Christ revealed, weget into trouble.Unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certainof.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, theycannot be certain.That is the problem of seeming arrogant.  The non-Christians around us knowthat human beings make mistakes, just as surely as we know it.  They do notbelieve we are infallible, any more than we do.When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never leadthem astray -- when we implicitly claim that we are infallible -- the non-Christians around us rarely believe that implicit claim.  Witnessing ishardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that youare either too foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally tryingto cover them up.I think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and whatthings we are only "very confident" of.  For example, we might say that weknow our sin, for recognising sin is something we directly experience.  Butother things, whether based on reasoning from Scripture or extra-Biblicalthinking, should not be labled as infallible: we should say that we arevery confident of them, and be ready to explain our reasoning.But, so far as I am aware, none of us is infallible -- speaking or actingas if our thinking is flawless is ridiculous. *`REXLEX' suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not Silent_, byFrancis Schaeffer.  I didn't think very highly of it, but I think thatMr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Evangelical Christians.  Somebodyelse might like it, though, so don't let my opinion stop you from reading it.If someone is interested in my opinion, I'd suggest _On Certainty_, byLudwig Wittgenstein.Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu"If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some Wittgenstein, 60% of the postings would disappear.

The properly-formed conscience canbe trusted virtually ALL the time.  I am not so sure, though, about somethingso materialistic as the human brain.  Does that mass of tissue possessanything trustworthy?  Your observation would probably be valid if we werediscussing the "mind" of an animal, but the human being is only half animal,as it were; and half spiritual. ?At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the?possibility of error appears.

(This?is something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity theinfallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects. ?Unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain?of.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they?cannot be certain.This argument of yours regarding the certainty of an observation or aconclusion is not necessarily substantiated by experience.  It reminds meof the theoretical physicist who said that you can never be certain ofa measurment because the sensor interferes with the field you are tryingto measure.  Now, the experimental physicist will reply that although themeasurement can never be made with absolute certainty, he is able todetermine the certainty with which the measurement can be made, and thisknowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enoughto allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation.Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, ourcompetence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in ourability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areasnot subject to the experimental method. ?Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu?"If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some?

The founder of thissect, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), proclaimed to be thePromised Reformer of this age as foretold in almost all the majorreligions of the world today (Islam, Christianity, Judiasm,  Hin-duism).  He  claimed  to  be  the  long awaited second comming ofJesus Christ (metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the PromisedMessiah.  He  claimed that the prophecies contained in almost allthe great religions of the world about the advent of a  messengerfrom God have been fulfilled.        The claims Hazrat Ahmad raised storms  of  hostility  andextreme  oposition from many priestlike people of Muslims, Chris-tians, Jews and Hindus of that age. Such opposition is often wit-nessed  in  the history of divine reformers. Even today this sectis being persecuted specially in  some  of  the  Muslim  regimes.Dispite  the  opposition  and persecution, this sect has won manyadherents in 130 countries. It has over 10 million followers, whocome from a diverse ethnic and cultural background.        The sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing  abouta better understanding of religion, and the founders of all reli-gions. Its mission is to unite mankind into one Universal  broth-erhood  and  develop  a  better  understanding  of  faith. AhmadiMuslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe-cially religious intollerance and fundamentalism.        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-tablished  a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clin-ics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffedby  volunteer  professional  and are fully financed by the sect'sinternal resources.        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moralreform,  establish  peace and justice, and to unite mankind underone universal religion.NEWSGROUP CREATION: ==================        When the Call For Votes is called,  the  discussion  willofficially  end.

So talk.religion.misc spends a lot of time onChristian/atheist arguments, soc.religion.christian spends a lot oftime on arguments among different christian groups, and the bitnetCatholic group spends a lot of time on arguments between conservativeand liberal Catholics.  Personally I would prefer to have a set ofsomewhat more specialized groups, at least as an alternative.  Liberaland conservative Protestant and Catholic would handle most of thetraffic, though there are certainly significant groups (e.g.Orthodox).  Of course it may be that most of our readers like thearguments.  I certainly find it painful moderating them.  --clh]

I'm just trying to find out the>coherence of the societally based morality position.  Is my assumption of>societally based morals wrong?  No, but you would need a lot of background reading in sociology to getto a point where the discussion would be focused enough to be helpful.The interaction of values and behavior among people has been a majordefining element of both psychology and sociology for a century now, andis the part of both disciplines (as social psychology) that strikes meas most relevant to the various naive arguments about morality on thenet.An exceptionally good place to get a clear view of "social norms" inaction is the "micro" sociology of Ervin Goffman.  There are some verygood introductory essays ("Deference and Demeanor" is a classic), aswell as accessible books like _Interaction Ritual_.  More difficult andtheoretical are some of his later books like _Frame Analysis_.  But evenat his most academic, Goffman escapes the dreadful boredom and heavilyjargon-laden theorizing that makes most standard sociology unreadable.Morality is essentially the playing out of individual goals and aims inthe setting of their expectations of other people, and others' expectationsof them.  This becomes "systematized" in a "socially mandated" way simplybecause otherwise we'd have to invent the entire context of interpersonalrealtions with every single interaction -- and we engage in social inter-actions usually hundreds or thousands of times a day, so that a renego-tiation of human interaction each time is a pretty ridiculous notion.We simply learn it (most of it) early, along with language (which is oneof the main exemplars.)--Michael L.

Then you can come home to something like this:    "Well, it's been a rough month," begins Johnnie Lawmaster.  "I just get laid off, and my divorce became final.  But I just wasn't ready for what happened this particular Monday."    That particular Monday was was December 16, the first day of the Bill of Rights' third century, the day when federal agents and local law enforcement officer broke into the house in Tulsa that always flew the U.S. flag.  When Lawmaster drove into the driveway that bleak afternoon, one of his neighbors had some news.    "'Ohmigod, John, you are in big trouble!' my neighbor tells me. 'Sixty police, federal agents and the bomb squad busted in you house, kicked down the door, cut locks off your gun safe.'  I couldn't believe it.  Then I walked inside.  What a nightmare."    It was no nightmare; it was horribly real life.  Apparently acting on information the Lawmaster possessed an illegal firearm, some thirty agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) teamed up with state and Tulsa police authorities, search warrant in hand, to search for a "Colt, AR-15, .223 caliber machine gun, unknown serial number."  The warrant, issued by U.S. Magistrate John Leo Wagner, also authorized agents to seize "any tools used in the alteration or modification of firearms, such as files or drills; documents, papers, books, records, and other tangible properties which identify occupants or owners of the property to be searched...."    Reports vary, but according to neighbors, the joint task force operation aimed at the unemployed warehouseman from a nearby hospital involved some 60 agents and local law enforcement personnel against Lawmaster.  They cordoned off the street; took station with weapons drawn in the back yard; used a battering ram to break through the front door; kicked in the back door; broke into his gun safe; threw personal papers around the house; spilled boxes of ammunition on the floor; broke into a small, locked box that contained precious coins; stood on a table to peer through the ceiling tiles, breaking the table in the process.  Then, they left.  The doors were closed but not latched, much less locked.  The ammo and guns were left unsecured.    "My front and back doors were pulled shut, but they were busted through and couldn't latch.  Anybody could have waltzed in there and stolen everything I own.  A child could have taken a gun.  The guns, the safe -- everything was open and laying around.  I keep all my magazines empty, but someone had loaded them.  While I was looking around in amazement, the gas, electric and water companies show up to turn the power off.  They said they were told to shut things down. Then I found the note.  "Nothing Found - ATF."    "They didn't make any attempt to notify me.  I've lived in Tulsa all my life and never got more than a traffic ticket.  How come they can't look that up, realize I've been law-abiding my whole life, then come to the door when I'm home?  They didn't leave someone here to watch over my private property.  They didn't even come by to explain what happened.  They just raided my home, ransaked it, left it wide open and left."    Lawmaster placed a phone call to the local BATF agent.  "I asked, 'Are you gonna' arrest me?' and he said, 'No.'  I asken him, "Who is going to repair and clean up my house?'  And he said, "If you're going to talk to me, come down to my office.'    "'I can't come down!' I said.  'My doors are broken!'  If I had been on vacation and I didn't have friendly neighbors, I would have lost everything I own.  Here I am a competent, responsible firearms owner, and the government leaves them open, unlocked, with ammo strewn around."    Lawmaster said the agent advised him, "If you want your door to lock and your gun safe to lock, you're gonna' have to pay for it yourself."    "'Oh, I'll come right down, alright,' I told him.  'I'll come down, but I'll bring my attorney.'  And he said, 'Well, you bring your attorney, and we won't talk to you.'"So if you don't want your tea party to be held in awkward silence, makesure your lawyer isn't there, there's a good chap.> It's very sad all those people died, especially the kids, but that's going> to happen in a free society whenever psychologically needy people hook up> with a charismatic nutcase.What a repulsive outlook on society.

However, I depend on my employers' provided healthcoverage, and fear that if I speak up about it, that I may losenot only my coverage but even my job.I would like to ask you to put into law the provision that healthinsurance providers make abortion coverage non-compulsory intheir health insurance program, so that it can be declined, withan appropriate reduction in premium.In order that there be no difference in the dollar ammount in thehealth benefit packages between those who would choose to haveabortion coverage and those who would not, I further ask that youinclude a provision in which the reduction in premium resultingfrom the declining of "abortion coverage" be paid-out to theemployee, rather than pocketed by the employer.  This second provision should serve to dissuade employers frompressuring employees into taking one or the other stand withregard to abortion services.  Thank you very much.

Even if the readers have the slightest idea as to what thewriter is referring to, it should be incumbent on Mr. Erwin to back up whathe says with at least a concrete example of perhaps even a reference or two.(For example, "Simon Zealotes" = the certain apostle having a nicknameconnected to a Jewish terrorist group)Even Josephus fails to make the kind of broad brush reference toChristians made above - he is quite silent as to the fate of the JewishChristian Church in Jerusalem, even though he took the time torecord the death of St. James (brother of St. John). On the subject of thefate of Jesus's family, including James (the brother of Jesus) we learnnothing from Josephus.Likewise, Tacitus condemns the Jews as being a particularly vicious people, getting many of the facts about Jewish history wrong inthe process. But even though Tactitus undoubtedly had the opportunityto learn much about the Christians during his tour in Asia Minor underDomitian, we find little to enlighten ourselves about the Christiansin either the _Histories_ or the _Annals_The writer's interpretation of _Acts_ is purely subjective asstated, and so one might expect him to elaborate a bit on just what aspectsof "cult psychology" are to be found there. I can think of a thing or two offhand, but I'd like to give Mr. Erwin the opportunity to demonstrate his ownknowledge satisfactorily before throwing out any more hints.Bill R.--"The only proposals in the Senate that I         "My opinions do not representhave seen fit to mention are particularly        those of my employer orpraiseworthy or particularly scandalous ones.    any government agency."It seems to me that the historian's foremost     - Bill Riggsduty is to ensure that virtue is remembered,and to deter evil words and deeds with thefear of posterity's damnation."- Tacitus, _Annals_ III. 65

Perhaps their diagnosis of the anit-cult movementneeds investigating in light of the Waco tragedy.

Tear gas is produced by burning a    chemical in the can.  The fumes produced are tear gas.  The canister has a     warning printed on the side of it.  "Contact with flamable material can result    in fire."  Now, how many of these canisters did they throw inside a building     they admited was a fire-trap??This whole thing was a case of over-reaction by the officials at every step.I hope it is thoroughly investigated and the responsible parties are heldaccountable.

If|> Jesus did in fact command his disciples to arm themselves, I would|> take that as yet another reason to reject Christian doctrine, for|> whatever it's worth.|> Let me clarify.  In order to more clearly understand scripture, one mustlook in the context of where the verse is found.  The section you referto here is found in Luke 22.  I'd like to start back at verse 35 and I'llinclude it here for the sake of completeness:   Then Jesus asked them, "When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals,   did you lack anything?"   "Nothing." the disciples replied.Verse 36 says:  "But now, if you have a purse take it and also a bag; and    if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.  It is written,    "And he was numbered with the transgressors."Verse 38 says:  The disciples said, "See, Lord, here are two swords."                "That is enough."  he replied.What does this all mean? In verse 35, Jesus points out to the disciples that when he sent them outpreviously, they did not need to take anything with them.  Their food,lodging and transport were often provided through the generosity of others.If verse 36, Jesus alludes to the change in attitude that is to come in thenear future.  Remember, Jesus was saying these things shortly before he wasto be arrested.  In verse 36, He tells the disciples that they will haveto take their own possessions and provisions with them.  THey will have tocarry their own purse because there will be no longer any generosity fromanyone.  And there will be times of peril when they will have to take careof themselves.  This was implied by the reference to the sword.  Jesus knewthat He was going to be arrested and labeled as a criminal.  The chargesbrought against Him were likely to be passed on to his disciples.In verse 38, we see that the disciples have taken Jesus too literally.  It isnot the first time that the disciples got His message wrong.  They had done this on several occassions.  Instead of understanding the gist of His words,they presented Him with two swords.  Jesus was perhaps taken aback bythis promptly concludes the discussion by saying, "That is enough."The disciples could not understand why Jesus had to die.  Jesus kept tellingthem over and over again that He would soon not be with them but they couldnot grasp this.  They wanted their Messiah to be a political leader who wouldlead them in rebellion against the Romans.  That is why they were so keen onpresenting Him with the swords.  They had no idea that Jesus was referring toa different kingdom of which they were to be a part of.  The disciples couldonly perceive of a kingdom on earth rather than the one in Heaven.Understand that Jesus NEVER intended his followers to take up arms in rebellion.This was clearly in evidence in Luke 22:51 when Jesus rebuked his disciples for using the sword against the servant of the high priest when they came to arrest Him.  As further evidence, Jesus goes so far as to heal the man injured by the disciples.  Jesus did NOT condone violence as a means for His purpose.Contrast this behaviour with that of David Koresh and you will clearly see thatDK was NOT Jesus as he claimed.  Jesus surrendered himself to the authouritiesand allowed himself to be crucified.  He didn't go out in a blaze of glory, butrather Jesus was executed like a common criminal.  I hope this makes it a little more clear.God be with you,Malcolm Lee  :)|> >>Well, when the nice federal officers come to my house to check out my|> >>extensive weapons cache, I'll just be sure not to shoot at them.|> >>"Tea, ladies and gentlemen?"|> |> >Actually, that's pretty much wht the "Branch Davidian" siad when|> >the local Sherrif knocked on their door.|> >Of course, when armed men assaulted them without warrning, it was a|> >different matter...|> |> Why?

Allow me one last inter-jection then please:Distinguishing among the religious Jews, you've excepted the Messianicfor obvious reasons. Specifically, are you saying it's these religious Jews, who trace their lineage back to Abraham by blood and orthodoxy, rather than by faith, who won't agree?  Orthodox Jews?  As to the a/a (if I understand your direction), the issue remains unproven I suspect, considering how atheists and agnostics so often look to reason. Atheist, it is reasonable to conclude will not agree.For agnostics, a poll seems in order. Who knows?  Myself, I'm not so sure the atheists can be counted out. For the orthodox, I wonder how many would follow Moses, or Abraham,or David in accepting God's Word? Is the particular covenant to whichone adheres, more important than God promisimg? I reckon for many itdepends on the ongoing dialogue. Under these considerations, you might understand why I think it's premature to assert who will and won't agree.   |-- J --   |   | stephen

The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking.                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyramwere murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split overwho to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just likeMohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims considerChrist to be a prophet the same as Jews, I'm led to understand.  Makeno mistake, this was no messiah we're talking about in Smith).  Thethought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handeddown father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was onlyentering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to havebeen bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  TheCouncil of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn't of much helphere, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects.Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waitedfor Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The otherclaimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)Both sects practiced the "1-year food stockpile" doctrine,and this being frontier and farming country most carried or atleast owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were amilitaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather thanface large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered agreat deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quitejustified in making military training a good thing.  Remember,this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these peoplehad nobody to turn to save themselves.Just a little context to put this all in perspective.>So what did the Mormons get?

LDS and RLDSphilosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the trueChurch as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on hisown merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS mayas well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  Youcan only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejectedit.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans toBuddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong theywill not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hooverliked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbadealcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like.These people are the "salt of the Earth" and as such are moreeasily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.That's my somewhat educated guess, anyway.  Both sects havesplinter groups that don't mirror the masses, but these are smalland rare, and hardly worth noting their common ancestry.None of this has any relevance to guns, though.

Any Messianic pretenderwould tell his followers to get ready for war, since theywere going to throw the Romans out of Judaea and free theIsraelites.For those interested, Bar Kochba's claim was taken far moreseriously than Jesus' among the Jews.  They revolted and600,000 were slaughtered by the Romans.  His claim was onlyrejected after his defeat, although for a short time he lookedas though he would win.  They even got to mint coins beforethe Romans triumphed.Now how that has played into Christianity is rather interestinggiven your use of the statement attributed to Jesus.  Did Koreshfigure he had to get rid of the US government to free Israel?Had he the foggiest notion of who are todays descendants ofthe Israelites?

No: reasonable alternative exists.I would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime; causes precede their effects. But if you claim that there must bean answer to "how" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from "nothing", science has some good candidates for an answer.I have always wondered why Christians use the "There are questionsscience (or atheism) cannot answer" argument; I hope this is theappropriate group to ask this question.The most popular question is the question of origins. Why does theuniverse exist, or anything, for that matter?I think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?and2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However,is it a meaningful question, after all?I would say it isn't. Consider the following:A die-hard skeptic being (be it human or whatever) attempts to doubtone's very existence. Since it is so easy to doubt everything else -I cannot be _sure_ the world exists, it may be my mind fooling me -can I ever be sure I exist?However, it is only possible to exist or not to exist. (Someoneinsert an appropriate Shakespeare quote here ;-) )A being that does not exist cannot doubt one's existence.A being that does exist can doubt one's existence, but this would bepointless - the being would exist anyway.Let us return to the original question: why? A being that does notexist does not need any reasons for its non-existence. This beingis not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind, but letus assume that the world exists independent of the mind (the objectivitypostulate). The question "why anything exists" can be countered bydemanding answer to a question "why there is nothing in nothingness,or in non-existence". Actually, both questions turn out to bedevoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don't existdon't exist. Tautology at its best.I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God isHimself the existence. However, I see several problems with thisanswer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God isactually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us andthem. This is pantheism, not Christianity.Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence.This sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does GodHimself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence,it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, alwaysexisted. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.This argument sounds like God does not exist, but meta-exists,and from His meta-existent perspective, He created existence.I think this is actually a nonsolution, a mere twist of words.The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapableof understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do notaccept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.The second question: How did the universe emerge from nothing?belongs to the domain of science, and I, for one, do not doubt thequestion can be answered by its methods. Many cosmologists havesuggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emergefrom vacuum (this possibility has been suggested in a recentHawking biography; see also Lizhi & Shuxian: Creation of the Universe,World Scientific, 1989). However, I think the sci groups are moreappropriate for discussions like this. : As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a "why".  That isn't: true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).This is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us "how",not why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the "why"questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that thesupernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it isas appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist. : I believe the "genetic code" will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes,: but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining, : reproducing life, *ever*.  (I've never been much of a prophet, though. I: can't even *picture* New York in my mind 8^] ).  I don't believe *any*: technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite: having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.This opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems aresomehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christiansin general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announcethey have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?There is a problem with your prophecy: artificial life has been created,although not yet in a chemical form. Computer simulations of evolutioncontain systems that are as much alive as any bacterium, althoughtheir code is electronic, as well as their metabolism. See a recent bookSteven Levy: Artificial life - The Quest for a New Creation. JonathanCape, London 1992.Artificial chemical life is just around the corner - after all, no spark of life has been found to be necessary; living systems do notviolate any physical laws as we know them. : You don't mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your: research, do you?  After all, if we of Christ are deluding ourselves, you: really have nothing to worry about, eh?Exactly. This is why I think atheists should _not_ post any evangelicalatheist arguments to soc.religion groups, since people who seek to find peace in religions must be allowed to gather together. I wouldnormally have asked these questions in alt.atheism or talk.religion.misc,but it seems many Christians do not read these groups.

There have been a number of posts defendingthe BD's as some persecuted religous minority, which is sheer bunk.Maybe the press and certain spokespeople bandied about the term "cult", etc.,but that is peripheral to the reasons for the initial assault and standoff.It was a weapons raid.  The feds couldn't give a hoot about the BD's religion, but any group that ILLEGALLY obtains and stockpiles automatic weapons is a threat.  This goes for neo-Nazis and other non-religous groups.So I have this question: If your religious group isn't stockpilingautomatic weapons or engaged in some other illegal activity, why is thisevent a blow to religious freedom? -MikeP.S.

The>only crime ("illegal activity") the Latter-day Saints had committed, was>their religious affiliation, their anti-slave stance (Missouri still>allowed slave practices), and their growing numbers/influence in Missouri.  Well... every group has a somewhat selective memory of it's past.  Even theprotestants who look to Martin Luther for starting the whole movementconveniently forget his diatribes telling nobles to slaughter the peasantswho rebelled against unjust conditions.>I guess the Mormons "got what they deserved," because they refused to bow>to the will of (corrupt and evil) secular authorities. This "disobedience">brought upon them persecution, murder, and finally forced expulsion from>their lands and settlements...  They stood up for what they believed in, and the people of the time hatedthem for that, and because they were different.  Xenophobia has always beenone of the strongest reasons for death and destruction.> [more about mormon oppression deleted..]> [...] when we tried to organize "soc.religion.mormon" and/or>"talk.religion.mormon," a whole bunch of "charitable" believers effectively>blocked our intent to create a group to discuss topics related to Mormonism>et al in an appropriate forum.

It's something called 'free speech',which radicals usually push aside in favour of doing what's 'right'.>  Frustrating our legitimate rights for proper representa->tion also belongs in the category of persecution.  It is ironic that those>who oppose us, point to all kinds of "justifications" to do so, despite>their claims of adhering to a gospel of love... Ahh... I agree with that most strongly.  Who cares about 'claims'??  All Iwant to see are actions.  If you act like you hate me, you probably do, allpie-in-the-sky religious affiliations to the contrary.>Lest anyone believe I do not believe in government: I do, but NOT without>questioning the wisdom and constitutionality of their decisions and>resolves.  Yes!  Most people don't realize that it's NOT some 'government' sittingin a far-away magical land that makes decisions, it's people.  And thosepeople make mistakes like any human.

Until this all settles, I'm not sure anyone can make that sort of blanketstatement.

You don't even have to break laws to get punished, as I'm sure many peoplehave found out.  What about the drug laws that permit the police to seizeany suspect goods?  And some grandmother travels with $30,000 in cash in herhandbag, (doesn't trust the banks), it falls open, and the police end upconfiscating it?  This is not an isolated case, either.  Or laws to stop companies from making look-alike Ford/GM car parts, andselling them as the real thing?  The first people that got raided were antiquecompanies who made 'real GM' parts for 1930's cars.  All I'm saying is that it should NOT be assumed that someone is inherentlyevil/etc when the government decides to nail them.  It's the people who blindy believe that the government does the best ineverything for them who are _really_ dangerous.  Alan DeKok.Reply-To: ALAND@physics.carleton.ca

Rana  <rana@rintintin.colorado.edu>Co-Moderator:  Dr. Tahir Ijaz  <ijaz@ccu.umanitoba.ca>A  BRIEF  DESCRIPTION  ABOUT  AHMADIYYA  ISLAM:===============================================        The Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam, an international organi-sation, was found in 1889 in Qadian, India. The founder of thismovement, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), was proclaimed to be the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in the Scripturesof almost all major religions of the world. He claimed to be the fulfillment of the long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ(metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah.        The claims of Hazrat Ahmad raised storms of hostility andextreme opposition, which are often witnessed in the history of divine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted especial-ly in some of the Muslim regimes. The right of Ahmadi Muslims to openly practice their religion and to define themselves as Muslimshas been severely restricted in many Muslim Countries. The UnitedNations, human rights organizations such as Amnesty Internationaland top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns against this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to themembers of this movement, but so far to no avail.        Despite the opposition and persecution, the movement cont-inues to grow with a current membership of millions from around theworld in over 130 countries, who come from diverse ethnic and cul-tural backgrounds.        The movement is devoted to world peace and strives towardsdeveloping a better understanding of all religions. Ahmadi Muslimshave always been opposed to all forms of violence, bigotry, reli-gious intolerance and fundamentalism.        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-tablished a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clinicsin many third world countries. These institutions are staffed byvolunteer professionals and are fully financed by the movement'sinternal resources. The movement stresses the importance of educa-tion and leadership. Its members have included a high number ofprofessionals as well as world class individuals.        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moralreform, establish peace and justice, and to unite mankind underone universal brotherhood.NEWSGROUP CREATION: ==================        The  discussion for this proposed newsgroup has now offi-cially ended. Voting will be held for three weeks. If the news-group gets 2/3rd majority AND 100 more "YES/Create" votes than"NO/don't create" votes; the newsgroup shall be created. ABOUT THE VOTE-TAKER: ====================        Mr. Anthony Lest has been asked by the proponents ofthis newsgroup to act as an official impartial vote-taker for theproposed newsgroup. He has no objection to  use his workstationfor the purpose of vote-taking. Neither the University of Colora-do, nor Anthony Lest has anything to do with the proposal of thenewsgroup.  They are just collecting the votes as a neutral thirdparty.QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS:=====================        Any questions or comments about the proposed newsgroupmay be sent to:     Nabeel A. Rana  <rana@rintintin.colorado.edu>        Any questions or problems in voting should be sent to:     Anthony Lest    <lest@ucsu.colorado.edu>

Gay people are and willcon- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates.  You maybe unaware of all the statistica "findings" concerning African-Americans thathave been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own biasagainst African-Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances,but there are many other groups.  Of course, the vast majority of the publicscoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case.Fortunately African-Americans had "whites" who supported their 'cause' andpublic sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around.  There waseven a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased.  In fact, until lawswere put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was prettymuch legal to discriminate against them.I know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be freeform discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something,that is your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)openly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society,including gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creationand making disciples.  We believe in the Lord's great commandment to Love,and we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popularto do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find achurch almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believesin the commandment of Love (though I'm hard-pressed to find many who actuallysho Love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especiallywithin their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christiancommunity for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionistsagainst the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed andtreated as runaway slaves for being "nigger-lovers" and such.  I guess I'vedecided the challenge is worth it.In my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragicstory centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straightwho have been hurt in the process, etc.  Funny thing is, I don't know of onecase where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to rejecttheir gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after theybegan to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.I'm apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0raged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition ValuesCoalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garnersupport within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for moreoppressive legisation against gays.Perhaps you don't get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn't get it in theMiddle Ages and the proclaimed God's will be done as they massacred thousandsin witch hunts and inquisitions.The message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gayrights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, evenhatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn't changethe results).  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, thefinal effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a"conditional" love for gays.  Condition:  Change and we'll love you. This issure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an "unconditional"love, one that calls people "just as they are."  Sure there are things thatwill 'naturally' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) thatneed to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are thingslike left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, isgoing to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to "otherpeople's expectations." In the process this coerced conformity causes manypeople a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who havenothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about theirown sense of pseuper-spirituality.This is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may beunpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do withsomething very personal like 'sexuality' (a taboo subject even today), but Ifirmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulationon thier bedrooms.  It's funny that most straight people have successfullyremoved restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation,but we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though ithelps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society.Gay people are not criminals.Another interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismaticchurch in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it's pastors arrested for self-admitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys).  This had apparentlybeen going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges werevoluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine thatwas how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thinghappen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friendsrecently told me he was "approached" by someone who is going through thereparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request fordinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.These are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments andcreating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is notthe call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment inColorado has created an organization who's posters are appearing all overColorado called "S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T." (I forget the whole definition off hand,but the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash) and their mottois "Working for a fag-free America" with an implicit advocation for violence.This is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others areembracing.We Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppressiontowards those we feel don't 'measure up', and constant beratement fromorganizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a goodpurpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways ofexcluding people.The Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to "include"people.  I have several of Dr. Martin's books and find them quite helpful,especially concerning 'cults.' But it seems that CRI, has become a cult untoitself.  Why don't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring peopleto Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away?WhateverRich :-(

There is a difference between calling>evolution a fact and talking about the theory of evolution providing>facts (I happen to think the latter is more accurate ).I hate doing this, because it's been done so many times before, but...Evolution, in the nonscientific sense, is change.  Although it isoften used in a colloquial manner to refer to phenomena that tendtoward higher complexity and ability, evolution simply implies change,for good or for bad.  In the scientific sense, evolution is merely thechange in allele frequencies for a given population over a period oftime.  This is usually what people refer to when they discuss thescientific fact of evolution.  We observe such shifts in allelefrequencies occurring all the time, so it is trivial to conclude thatevolution is a scientific fact.The mechanisms that enable such changes in allele frequencies arecollectively known as the theory of evolution.  Darwin's naturalselection is one such theory.  Genetic drift is another.  Gene flow isstill another.Evolution is a fact and a theory.

The term 'rational' does not apply to a simple statement like that.You would have to include the statement within a syllogism andassert the rationility of the syllogism.A statement is just a statement.  As to its objectivity - well it depends what you mean.Values tend to be regarded as good or bad, valid or invalid, true or false,and so on.  Objective values are those which must fall into one or other ofthose options for all people - or, if you are prepared for dissent, thenthey are those values which should be accepted by everyone.If someone rejects an objective value they are regarded as 'wrong'.Objective values require a fundamental notion of good versus bad, or atleast right versus wrong (or even just correct versus incorrect) anda way of relating that to specific aspects of human behaviour.In my opinion that requires a belief in a deity of some sort.Suppose you could predict with almost 100% accuracy that Americansbelieved that something is better than nothing.You could usefully say that the existence of that value was anobjective fact.  You could not say that the value itself wasobjective.   You could not do that unless you could prove that thevalue was 'right'.  Showing that everyone happens to accept the valueas right doesn't show that it is right.>Do you agree with me then that the assertion "no values are objective" >is false?Well I am a believer in a God.  So I do believe that some values areobjective.  But I usually suspend that belief when posting to t.abecause it immediately invalidates subsequent arguments in the mindof many t.a readers.So, ignoring the idea of a God, I disagree with you.I believe, in this limited context, that 'no values are objective'.But I think that this thread is showing some cross-purpose debate.I think I understand your use of the word 'objective' whenrelating it to values.  I think it is an unusual usage, but Ibelieve you are consistent given that usage.tommy

It should be remembered that all of the first reports came from        the FBI, and that independent observers, i.e. the press, were not        allowed to get close and see things for themselves.  Official        communiques tend to be self-serving for the agencies that issue        them.         People in general tend to believe first reports, as these get        the most and the biggest headlines.  Corrections are often        overlooked.          An example is the FBI report that several of the bodies found        in the rubble had bullet wounds.  The local coroner, who is        independent of the FBI, has so far found no bullet wounds! .

I have admitted to myself that I cannot control every aspectof my being.  There are times I know I shouldn't say something, butthen say it anyway.  There are times I simply forget a lesson.I, in fact, am not my own master.  I need help.  Jesus promised methis help.  And I took him up on his offer.  I have willfully letJesus be my master because Jesus knows what is better for me thanI myself do.  And why not?  Does not the creator know his creationbetter than the creation?

My God says that you will not CEASE EXISTING.  You havelife forever.  You can choose to either live it in hell in eternaltorment where there is no communication whatsoever, or can choose to live it in paradise with God.  That is what my God says.  And thatwas the issue.  Your made-up theism is what it is--made up.  It'swishful thinking. >Nope -- most people are Christian.

You enjoy darkness, and you're proud of it.Is this the religion of Kendigianism?  Most people are not Christian.  Mostpeople, including Christians,  are not fond of feeling that theyare imperfect.  Is "the world an undesireable place" a doctrineof Kendigianism?  It has nothing to do with my God.  DoesKendigism have magical mystical prayers as a part of its worship?Mine doesn't.  Does Kendigianism believe that the world will be holy again?  Mine doesn't.  Does Kendigianism also dictate that one must obey what thepriest tells them like good little sheep?  Mine doesn't.  Is thisa bunch of lies you tell yourself so that you can justify being ignorant of the Bible?Brian, following Christ has nothing to do with the doctrines of Kendigianism.You would find any of your doctrines in the Bible.   I don't follow Kendigianism.I follow Christ.   Also, to try to again show you your ignoranceof Christ and the Bible in regards to "priests",  have you not read aboutthe sole Melchizedek priest in Hebrews 7 and 8?  Have you not read what thepurpose is of the Old Testament Levitical priesthood and why there shouldNOT be priests today?  Yes, guess what?  The Catholics messed up.  I donot follow Catholicism or any "ism."  I follow Christ.>Nope.  You make decisions, enjoy your successes, and accept your>failures; then you die.  If you are content with the life you've led>as you reflect back on it in your final moments, then you've led a>good life.Why would you want to live a good life?To you, you die and that's it.  Don't contradict yourself.  You haveno reason to live a good life.  It doesn't do you any good in theend.  Your life doesn't do anybody else any good  either becauseeveryone dies anyway.  So you have no reason to lead a good life. Leadinga good life is meaningless.

Jesus is alive.  Jesus is NOT dead.Jesus was sacrified to fufill the Old Testament sacrificial systemin its every detail.  Jesus's death was like a seed.

I can agree with most of what you typed here.  However, just becausemorality gets based on something nonrelative does NOT mean that we have topick your xtianity as its base.We can start a morality based on dignity of humans, freedom of choice,tolerance, etc. and NEVER EVER rely on xtianity for anything.  Just becausesomeone has a consistent moral system based on true principles does notmean that they have to involve xtianity in it.  Xtianity certainly does nothave a monopoly on principles of behavior; indeed, fewer religions areguiltier of violating their own principles

Although you areremoving one service, that may have feedbacks into other types of coveredcare which results in a net increase in actuarial costs.For an illustrative example in the opposite direction, it may be possibleto ADD services to an insurance contract and REDUCE the premium.

They are extremely usefulmathematical models to describe physical observations we can make.Other posters have aptly explained the atomic model.  Gravity, too, isvery much a theory; no gravity waves have even been detected, but wehave a very useful model that describes much of the behavior onobjects by this thing we _call_ gravity.  Gravity, however, is _not_ a fact.  It is a theoretical model used to talk about how objects behave in our physical environment.  Newton thought gravity was asimple vector force; Einstein a wave. Both are very useful models that have no religious overtones or requirements of faith, unless of course you want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly the way the theory now formulated talks about it.

[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints].I don't usually read t.r.m.  It is truly informative to stop by, and see that thereare still people in the world like those that forced my ancestors into the desertsof Utah, and then out of the country entirely.  (My grandmother was born in Mexico,where her family had moved to escape religious persecution in the US).  I'm willingto admit that members of other churches are Christians, if they believe in Christ and(try to) follow his teachings, even though they have different interpretations of the bible.  And yet these other churches often go out of their way to define whetheror not I am considered to be Christian.  Could someone mail me a set of rules/beliefsthat must be followed to be a Christian?  Does this set of rules exclude other largebodies of believers?  I know, this is a waste of everyone's time, this has probably been discussed N times,etc.  I guess I'm more sensitive to this 'demonization' after what went on in Texas.--Don Corbitt, donc@microsoft.comMail flames, post apologies.

ALL of them.Don't tell me they do not exist.  They are standardequipment.2)  So you think Koresh fired the place, because of the explosion?a)  Tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread it.  This  aerosol is DELIBERATELY made to be as non-flammable  as possible.  It is as non-flammable as possible..... gotcha!  ... when in isolation from other substances.  WHy was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote  launchers?  WHy did the FBI not announce "this window,  blown in plus tear gas, five minutes; then the wall come  down", and maintain a left to right sequence?b)  Most aerosols also have a secondary compound, that when  mixed in, becomes a VERY flammable (and difficult to trace)  suspension, with a VERY special property:  exposure to  brief eruptions of high heat (muzzle blasts) or long  exposure to low heat (matches, a stove) will NOT tend  to ignite.What other chemicals come up in the forensics?Who else will be allowed to test the site?c)  After a few minutes to hours (ifdesired, the combnation  rate can be controlled as desired), the mixture can be made  to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature  above a certain point (a tracer round) for a certain  heat quantity (a small explosive charge) or for a length  of time (start a wall fire and wait).Check your military records; look at the tapes.Why were tanks (large capacity delivey systems),tear gas (why not somnorifics?), and now (whythe hurry. was there still a comm channel opento the outside?).Do you see any trace of fire coming BACK to thecompound in the videos?  ALL the videos?  Which onesare missing?Do I sound paranoid?  Maybe.  Am I? Probably not.You trust the FBI and BATF  to render judgement?IN advance of a Court?  God help us.(For we are surely not helping ourselves).You trut the Federal Gevernment to give us a clean slate?You are 4.3 trillion (admitted!) down and counting.Look again.Did it happen that way?  I do not know.  I was not there.AND IT SHOULD WAIT FOR A COURT TO DECIDE.But will that happen?  89 people will NOT have the chanceto tell their side as the BATF leader was, on camera.No one wins.

I'm not a Jew but I understand that this is theJewish way of thinking. However, the Jews believe that the Covenant betweenYHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a MoralCode to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundariesfall, though.As I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that wasrequired, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed thatthe Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding ofthe required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud).The essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface betweenMan and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicateanything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).>>The first thing that comes to mind is that man is supposed to be created>in His image, so there is an argument that we are committed to whatever>moral code He follows as part of trying to live up to that image.  If we>are supposed to live by Christ's example, you would be hard pressed to>argue that God is a "do what I say, not what I do" kind of guy.The trouble with all of this is that we don't really know what the "createdin His image" means. I've heard a number of different opinions on this andhave still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart ifone wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphorsunashamedly!) As to living by Christ's example, we know very little aboutJesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narrativesby his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians.Revelation aside, one can only "know" Christ second-hand or worse.This is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that wayinitially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bibleto interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is whereFaith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.>>Metaphysically, if there are multiple moral codes then there is no>Absolute moral code, and I think this is theologically questionable.No. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiplemoral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moralcode. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the childmay assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has toldthe child that it is "wrong". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper inthe pub or bar (where there are no children). The "wrongness" here is ifthe child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is "inappropriate"to swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front ofanimals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows thathe is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) butyou get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directiveas absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.David.---On religion:"Oh, where is the sea?", the fishes cried,As they swam its clearness through.

There is of course only one weak spot in this theory -- we only have the FBI's WORD that the guys setting the fire were wearing black, and you've already demonstrated that the FBI consists of bald-faced liars.  From this we can immediately conclude that they were not in fact wearing black, and that that description was part of the FBI cover-up.  Who was it really?

It simply> means "hang oneself".Actually, if you do further research as to the Greek word "apacgw," you willfind that it does denote success.  Those scholars did indeed have an excellentreason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out, Irecently checked several Lexicons:"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament," Louw and Nida"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament""Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament," Grimm"Word study Concordance," Tynsdale"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other  early Christian Writings," Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon," PerschbacherA couple simply stated "hanged oneself", and a couple were more explicit and stated that "apacgw" means specifically "kill yourself by hanging." Acouple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for "apacgw" is"strangle, throttle or choke" (which pretty much invalidates the guy whosuggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the bestreferences though, "Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the NewTestament," not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, theliteral translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and alsoother presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to givefurther context).  The word "apagchw" has two root words: "gchw" is the "to strangle" root, andthe root word "apo" means literally "away." This root words is included inwords which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: thegreek word "apagello" means to send a message).  "Apo" can also denote achange in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinsonspecifically makes comparison to the word "apokteiuo," which means "to kill."In literal meaning the word "apacgw" means "to throttle, strangle to put outof the way," and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away fromlife, to death).  So while the word "apacgw" does mean "to hang," itspecifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when hestate that it means "to hang oneself, to end one's life by hanging." He thennotes the the use of "apacgw" in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  Hepresents that example of "apacgw" as being used to explicitly mean "suicide byhanging." Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without theadded denotation of "death," and as you insist that the Bible was written byGod, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the completemeaning of "apacgw" (ie: Since the word "apacgw" was used, then death isdenoted as the result). By the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of "apacgw":> In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus),> it's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : "Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice > was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house,> to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and > died; and he was buried in his father's tomb."   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> ^^^^ > Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel "hanged himself" [Gr. Sept.,> APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, "and died".  Here we have no doubt of the> result.> In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.Note Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew toGreek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie" the theHebrew say "and died"), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek. It should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added "and died", thecorrect translation would still be "apacgw," as the man did indeed die fromstrangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that theSeptuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versionswhich contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarilyexecuted by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as itnow stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to proveyour point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing"apacgw" and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthlessassertions without corresponding evidence. Now I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research itone of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus,I think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and abovewhat the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek orhistorical source to justify it. By the way, as to Mr Rose's statement about trees around the Potter's Field:> There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.Unless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or thatthere are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old descriptionof the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him toassert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees twothousand years ago (after all, things change). Now as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the sameas the 30 silvers:> As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the> money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather> than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically> mention "the reward of iniquity" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions> what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 "...concerning> Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.").  Now I would point out> that when the Bible describes an act of "iniquity," and then immediately> discusses "*the* reward of iniquity," it would be rather inane to suggest that> it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed."> >  > Notice that in verse 16, the word "iniquity" is not used.  Rather, it states> that Judas "became a guide to those who arrested Jesus".> But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, "for he was numbered with us and> obtained a part in this ministry."  What part did Judas play in their ministry?>          ^^^^^^True, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas' betrayal"an iniquity," but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas'actions "an iniquity" either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas tookthe money box, but rather said:    "Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling     him "Buy what we need for the feast"; or that he should give something     to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and     it was night."Note that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the moneybox.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choosethe a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a differentbook, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned bythe author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived. Of course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seenevidence that "apacgw" means suicide.  You see, since Judas' hanging wassuccessful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, becauseMatthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie:Passover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himselfthe next day.  Thus the money which bought the "Field of Blood" would have tohave been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silverthat night as well, and thus couldn't have spent that either.  Oh dear, Ibelieve that the house of cards is comming down). Maybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified onFriday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.By the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter's field came from (ie: themention of it in Matthew), you say:> Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss> this with you.I am reminding you now to discuss it now. It's all part of the same verse weare discussing, and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping these issues. Later,Dave ButlerA wise man proportions his belief to the evidence.David Hume, PhilosopherAn Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding    PS. I would note again, that you are not stating that that Bible    is not possibly inerrant; you are stating that it *IS* inerrant.    Since you have been, by your own admission, presenting merely "possible"    reconciliations (I of course don't rate them that highly), then the     best you can do is say that the Bible is "possibly" inerrant, not that     it *is* inerrant.

TRANSLATION The Vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three modes of materialnature. O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. Be freefrom all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and beestablished in the self.                                  PURPORT All material activities involve actions and reactions in the threemodes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, whichcause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitiveactivities to gradually elevate the general public from the field ofsense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna,as a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself tothe transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in thebeginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supremetranscendence. All the living entities who are in the material world arestruggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation ofthe material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and getrid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sensegratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then thechance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of theUpanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is apart of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark thebeginning of transcendental life. As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions inthe material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualitiessuch as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by toleratingsuch dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. Thistranscendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when oneis fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.Bhagavad-Gita As It isBooks of A.C.

(Just as one should not be compelled to pay for lipposuction>coverage if ONE doesn't WANT that kind of coverage).There are "basic services" and there are "optional services", Dennis. Call waiting is an optional service, but having the number "3" work on one's phoneis a basic service. Just because some nutcase doesn't happen to use the "3"on his phone, since none of the numbers he calls has a "3" in it, doesn't mean that he has the right to demand that the phone company "unbundle" the chargesfor the use of each phone digit; an unbundling that would be horrendouslyinefficient because of all the billing & bookkeeping overhead. Similarly, abortion can be seen as a "basic service".Furthermore, public funding of abortion SAVES money, as well as being, in the views of a substantial portion of the population, probably a clear majority, an ethical thing to do. If you don't like saving money on your taxes in that way, why don't you take the taxes you save and invest in private charities with programs that help reduce the NEED for abortion. If every pro-lifer did the same, it would create a massive economic negative feedback loop which would all but ELIMINATE the need for public funding of abortion. Then you would get your wish. And, you know what? No pro-choicer I know would stopyou carrying out that plan. They might even HELP you with it...- Kevin

With all the tear gas and the lack of electical power in the compound and        the adults wearing gas masks, it had to have been chaotic inside.        I can easily image someone leaving a lamp too close to something or        accidentally dropping a lamp or knocking one over.

I personally can't reallyasses any relative probablities to either of these 3 probabilities although ifforced to bet on the issue, I would probably take an accident (either FBI orBD) over intential setting of the fire).   I would also like to add a comment related to the reports that bodies recoveredhad gunshot wounds.  The coroner was on the Today Show this morning and categoricallydenied that they've reach any such conclusions.  He pointed out that under intenseheat, sufficient pressure builds up in the head that can cause it to explode andthat this can look very much like a massive gunshot wound to the head which isquite consisted with te reports I've read and heard.   In short, there's been almost no evidence corroborating any of the manyscenarios as to what happened on Monday.

This is the idea thatvirtual partical pairs can form so close to the event horizen that oneof the pair is trapped and the other goes free. The conservation ofenergy requires that the black hole lose mass, albeit very slowly, thatthat if primordial black holes were formed, the ones about the size ofsmall asteriods should be evaporating about now in the history of ouruniverse. The story goes that we should be able to see the flashes causedby the explosions that result at the end of these black holes. Does thisidea still hold promise, or has it been debunked.Bruce Salem

No matter how "absurd" it is to suggest that a common moral system created bymankind is absolute, it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a commonmoral system created by mankind is sensible. In fact, for the Bible to be ofany use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and aworkable moral system created for everyday use.The Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysingevery word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children ofIsrael were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and CeremonialLaws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instanceof moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.It seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo-Christian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see fromthe diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may wellbe an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind tofollow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept waswritten down by man.This leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take thedivine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in manydifferent ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in thefifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to dothat to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take anagnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suitsociety (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could takethe basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to createand justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enablesthe people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophershave done).Whatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, Ithink the important aspect is the result.David.---On religion:"Oh, where is the sea?", the fishes cried,As they swam its clearness through.

Many young adults come there to search for meaning in their life and to deepen their understanding of their faith through a sharing with others. This newsgroup will allow such a sharing through a monthly "Johannine Hour" which will be posted at the beginning of each month. A "Johannine hour" involves a short commentary on a given Bible passage, followed by some questions for reflection.  Any thoughts that may arise in consequence and that you wish to share with others can be posted here. We are not interested in theological debate, and even less in polemics. No expertise is required! The idea is to help one another to deepen our understanding of Scripture as it is related to our own life-journey.The idea of "Johannine hours" was born in Taize as a simple responseto all those who were trying to assimilate the Bible's message in themidst of their daily life. Because of work or studies, it is oftenimpossible to spend long hours in silence and reflection, buteveryone can take an hour from time to time to enter a church, sitquietly at home or go out for a walk in the woods. There, in silence,we can meditate on a passage of Scripture to listen to the voice ofChrist.During the time of silence, it is important to concentrate on what we understand and not waste time worrying if, in some Biblical expressions, we find it difficult to hear the voice of Christ. The idea is to communicate to others what we have understood of Christ, not burdening them with our own hesitations but rather telling them what has brought us joy, what has led us to run the risk of trusting more deeply.Perhaps those who read and think about the "Johannine Hours" in thisnewsgroup could share their reflections and discoveries with others.The important thing is the complementarity between two aspects, thepersonal aspect of silent, personal reflection and the communal aspectof sharing, which through Usenet makes us a part of a worldwide network.BACKGROUND OF THE TAIZE COMMUNITY:=================================The following provides some background information on the life andvocation of the Taize (pronounced te-zay) community."A PARABLE OF COMMUNION": August 1940, with Europe in the grip ofWorld War II, Brother Roger, aged 25, set up home in the almostabandoned village of Taize, in Eastern France. His dream: to bringtogether a monastic community which would live out "a parable ofcommunity", a sign of reconciliation in the midst of the distress ofthe time. Centering his life on prayer, he used his house to concealrefugees, especially Jews fleeing from the Nazi occupation.AN INTERNATIONAL AND ECUMENICAL COMMUNITY: Taize's founder spent thefirst two years alone. Others joined him later and at Easter 1949,seven brothers committed themselves together to common life andcelibacy. Year by year, still others have entered the community, eachone making a lifelong commitment after several years of preparation.Today, there are 90 brothers, Catholics and from various Protestantbackgrounds, from over twenty different countries. Some of them areliving in small groups in poor neighbourhoods in Asia, Africa, Northand South America. The brothers accept no donations or gifts forthemselves, not even family inheritances, and the community holds nocapital. The brothers earn their living and share with othersentirely through their own work. In 1966, Sisters of Saint Andrew, aninternational Catholic community founded 750 years ago, came to livein the neighbouring village, to share the responsibility of welcomingpeople in Taize.TAIZE AND THE YOUNG; THE INTERCONTINENTAL MEETINGS: Young adults, andless young, have been coming to Taize in ever greater numbers since1957. Hundreds of thousands of people from Europe and far beyond havethus been brought together in a common search. Intercontinentalmeetings take place each week, Sunday to Sunday, throughout the yearand they include youth from between 35 and 60 countries during anyone week. The meetings give each person the opportunity to explorethe roots of their faith and to reflect on how to unite the innerlife and human solidarity. The meetings in summer can have up to6,000 participants a week. Three times every day, the brothers andeverybody on the hill come together for common prayer in the Churchof Reconciliation, built in 1962 when the village church became toosmall."A PILGRIMAGE OF TRUST ON EARTH" The community has never wanted tocreate a "movement" around itself. Instead, people are called tocommit themselves in their church at home, in their neighbourhood,their city or village. To support them in this, Taize has createdwhat it calls "a pilgrimage of trust on earth". At the end of eachyear, the pilgrimage has a "European meeting" which brings togethertens of thousands of young adults from every part of Europe forseveral days in a major city. There have also been meetings in Asiaand in the United States. Every year, Brother Roger writes an openletter to the young. Usually completed during a stay in one of thepoor regions of the world, these are translated into thirty languagesand provide themes for reflexion for the following year.NOTE:  Discussion on the creation of this newsgroup will take place in        news.groups.For any further information contact: Brother.Roy@almac.co.uk               brother.roy@almac.co.uk--  . 1st 1.10b #332 .

I do presume that you know or at least believe that yours is true. Attempting to ream my faith without replacing it with something "better" is a real good way to loose a person completely from Christ.This is the greatest reason I see that these attacks are not motivated by love. They only seek to destroy there is no building or replacing of belief. This is not something Christ did. He guided and instructed He didn't seek to destroy the faith He found, He redirected it. This is what I see when people say they "love" <insert favorite group here>. And I have to laugh at the irony. Please excuse the scarcasm but it was nice to say it. Oh, BTW Robert don't take this personally, your post was merely convinent.

This is exactly what it has become -- a far cry from>its original position of stature .Looking at [1] we find that during Roman times "Tyre vied with Sidonfor first place in the intellectual life of the period"; that Tyre wasthe seat of a Christian bishop, eventually with 14 dioceses under it;that "the most magnificent church of its kind in all Phoenecia" was thebasilica built in Tyre ca. 314; that Tyre was well known for itsexports of glassware, wine, white marble, and dyed cloth; that Tyre,along with other seaports, "provided outlets for South Arabian, Indianand even Chinese trade"; that Tyre had to accomodate its growingpopulation by "following a perpendicular, rather than horizontal, lineof growth" (because it was running out of land to build on); that Tyreestablished colonies of its own.  None of this sounds like a "smallfishing village" by any stretch of the imagination.Centuries later, under the Abbasids, Tyre had "opulent and flourishingbazaars" and buildings of 5-6 stories.  During this period, Tyre was"noted for its export of sugar, beads, and, as of old, glassware."During the Crusades, Tyre was the second-most flourishing city heldby Franks.  (There is a lot more, but I got tired of writing.)In [2] we read the following description of modern Lebanon: "other*major cities* in Lebanon include Tripoli, Sidon, Tyre, Baalbek andZahlah."  [my emphasis]  This source also discusses the impact ofthe Lebanese Civil War, and the Israeli military actions (1978, 1982)on the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon.  It notes that after Israel'swithdrawel in 1984, "Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its localeconomy."If Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present,why is it always called a city (or, above, a "major city")?  Whydoes it show up on all the maps?   When population figures for citiesin Lebanon are given, why is Tyre always one of the cities on thelist (even if the list is only a dozen cities long)?[1] Philip K. Hitti, _Lebanon in History: From the earliest times tothe present_, NY, St. Martins, 1967.  [2] Federal Research Division, Library of Congress, _Lebanon: acountry study_, edited by Thomas Collelo, 1989.>>In the early 1980's Tyre had over 22,000 people.>>So far I've seen stated figurers ranging from 15,000 to 22,000.>Let's assume the latter one is correct.  By modern standards>we are talking about a one-horse town.A one-horse town?  Sounds like a lot of work for one horse.(Anyway, Tyre is connected by roads to the mainland.  Theymay even use cars these days. :-) The 1991 Encyclopedia Britannica says "Pop. (1982 est.) 23,000."  Most other references give figures in the 14-17 thousand range.(One atlas gives the population of Tyre as 60,000; the samesource give comparatively high figures for Sidon and Beirut, also,so I doubt that it is a typo.  Perhaps these were figures forthe cities and their surrounding areas.)  I don't doubt that thepopulation of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades.  Inparticular, the 1982 Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit.   >> After Alex the G it fell once more in the 1200's, I believe.  What>>other times did it fall that you were thinking of? >>To Egypt (250 bce); to the Seleucids (198 bce); Rome (63 bce); after>Rome it fell to various Arab contingents until 1124 ce when it was>captured in the Crusades;  it was then recaptured again by the Muslims>in 1291 ce and subsequently pillaged; then the French, Turks, British,>and today, Lebanon.I thought you were talking about times that Tyre was destroyed.Don't most, if not all, of these apply not just to Tyre but to the other cities in the area?  Sidon, for example?  Can you makea case for Tyre having been singled out?>>Well, it recovered enough to have a thriving commerce in the dye>>"Tyrian purple" in Roman times. >>This is correct, but they were under Roman domination, and the >majority of the created wealth was siphoned off.

From [2]:Tyre "receiv[ed] the rights [of autonomy] from Antiochus Ephiphanesand from 125 BC onward enjoy[ed] complete autonomy. She started alarge series of coins, occasionally in gold ..."The descriptions of Tyre under the Romans don't seem to fityour characterization, either.  And under the Abbasids it seemsto have been allowed to flourish.  I still think you are stretchingwhen you try to describe Tyre as having been nothing but a smallfishing village.>Who is Josh McDowell.A Christian apologist whose standards of scholarship are quite low.He happens to quote the same source you quote (Nina Jidejian,_Tyre through the Ages_, Beirut, Dar El-Mashreq Publishers, 1969).The same sentence, in fact.  He defends the fulfillment of theprophecy using the same argument you are using, an argument thatI haven't seen in print anywhere else, which is why I jumped tothe conclusion that you were quoting Josh.(I tried to find the Jidejian book, but it isn't listed in Booksin Print.

"Reasonable" is an accuracy judgement. #They are not the same thing at all. ("Useful in making some conclusion" is #an accuracy judgement again, I'm afraid.) This is the root of the problem: I bloomin' well amn't punning on theword value!!!  I know it's ambiguous.  I've told you the sense inwhich I'm using it (worth, use, goodness, etc).  And value DOESN'T meanaccuracy, by any stretch of the imagination.  Value=result of a computation,is not what I mean, but I accept it as a possible misinterpretation of'value'.  Value == accuracy comes from out of left field.  I can only understand that by '"useful in making some conclusion" is an accuracyjudgement' you mean one can judge whether it is *really* useful in makingthat conclusion or not.   That's part of what I mean by objectivevaluation - values grounded in solid facts.  One doesn't value x for the purpose y if all the evidence suggests that x doesn't really do that. Therest of what I mean is that the really fundamental values (e.g.  our own freedom) are solid facts in themselves.Consider each of the following statements:(1) The only reason that the distinction between 'accurate' and 'inaccurate' exists at all is that a group of people finds it useful.  (2) The main reason that science exists at all is that a group of peoplefinds the distinction between 'accurate' and 'inaccurate' useful indealing with phenomena.(3) Scientists find simple theories with accurate predictions useful inmodelling phenomena.Where is the 'pun' of which you speak?  Where am I arguing from idiom?  And what is wrong, if those statements are true, with concluding that "the basis of science is its *judged* usefulness in dealing with phenomena, i.e. 'subjective' values"?    After all, what on earth is (3), if not a 'subjective' value judgement?  (an 'accurate' value judgement, maybe?)Just to illustrate what I mean: what's the difference between saying'simple theories with accurate predictions are the best tools we haveto model phenomena' and (say) 'Love and intelligence are the best tools we haveto achieve freedom'?  Is one 'objective', the other not?  Both are judgements about value ("best"), and both have the same empirical basis, from where _I_ sit.#Sorry, Frank, but all you're doing is#using the ambiguity of English to obfuscate the issue. IF you#mean to say that science is based on value (accuracy) judgements,#I have no problem with that. If you mean to say that it's based#on value (goodness) judgements, that's nonsense. By contrast,#morality is clearly based on goodness judgements.I'm afraid I do mean to say that it's based on "goodness" judgements."Simple theories with accurate predictions are better (_better_, BETTER) tools for interpreting reality than complex theories with inaccurate predictions" is a fundamental value judgement that scientists make.  A relativist might say that it only holds in the reference frame of "science", or of a given scientist - but it seems pretty solid and objective to me.-- Frank O'Dwyer                                  'I'm not hatching That'odwyer@sse.ie                                  from "Hens",  by Evelyn Conlon

Do you claimto have an objective one?  I'll assume your answer is "yes," apologiesif not."Objective" means is that different observers will get the same results.The observers may need to be trained in the use of the system.  I'd beinterested in seeing a summary of your system, though I appreciate thatit might take a great deal of effort to put it in writing.In your post above you objected to "situational morals."  Perhaps youcould begin by explaining how you objectively set the situationalboundaries of an act, in your system.  I don't think you can do it.Here's a game we could play that would illustrate my point.  I think ofa situation, and you have to say whether it is moral or not, and why.In your move you can1) Ask me any objective question about the situation, or2) Pronounce judgement.After you have pronounced judgement, I get to add whatever context I liketo the situation, provided I don't change anything I have already said.If I can change the context to one where your objective system would givea different answer, then your system is faulty.  (Since I don't know whatyour system is, either you must write it down, or at least be consistent.)Do you think your system could pass this test?-Norman

Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable toall people, not just the Jews.  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom ofHeaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was madeobsolete by Jesus.If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In thefollowing verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds uponthe Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.  If you'll notice, Healso reams into the Pharisees for mucking up the Law with their own contrivedinterpretations.  They knew every letter of the Law and followed it with theirheads but not their hearts.  That is why He points out that our righteousnessmust surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdomof Heaven.  People such as the Pharisees are those who really go out of theirway to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin.They had become legalistic, rule-makers - religious lawyers who practiced theletter of the Law but never really believed in it.  I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot ofmodern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believein it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?Christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one'sperspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will.Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is theirchoice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.God be with you,Malcolm Lee  :)

(this is no sin, I know next tonothing about it either) I mean, anything other than this "10^50" probability thing which you got wrong in the first post.The speculation involved is really your own, isn't it? How much _biology_do you know, even apart from abiogenesis? Any classes past high school?Read Chris Colby's FAQ? How much paleontology, geology, etc do you know?Or are you speculating that its all speculative? Do you have any basisupon which to imply that to keep an "open mind" one must allow thatthe earth, universe, and all the creatures in it could have been created~10,000 years ago? None of this is intended as a flame. To say thatyou don't know a subject is _not_ the same as calling you an idiot. Idon't know _much_ about these areas, but then I am not the onecalling into question all of mainstream science. In other words, wheredo you get off calling it speculative unless by this you also mean thatall of physics, chemistry, etc are also speculative in some sense?You may have, in fact, not been implying that the rejection of creationismis a sign of close-mindedness, or that the theory of evolution is especiallyspeculative, in which case I have merely misinterpretedyou.

It should be clear from my response to Bill Rawlins above that in this thread I am objecting only to the use of Josephus to validate the messiah claim.  The argument against themessiah claim is not weak (maybe mine is, but in the hands of pros it is not).There are indeed two passages.  The short one *cannot be used* to validate themessiah claim, imo.  That's why I refered to the long, which can be used.  It flatly states Jesus "was the Christ", and mentions the crucifixion, resurrection and Christian belief in said claims.The short entry mentions Jesus in passing as James' brother - "... brother ofJesus, who *was called* the Christ, .... [emphasis mine]", and that's it. If original, Josephus has merely reported what some people say.  It is nothing more than an observation, one which lacks the Christian fundamentals.The long is widely regarded as an insert for three reasons: 1) its way out ofcontext, 2) Origen evidently knew nothing of it, and 3) its rather inconsistentwith the short.  There is consensus among scholars as defined on the long as insert, and I see Jim agrees.  Consensus is usually reflected subtly, as inElaine Pagel's _Gnostic Gospels_ (p. 85), "A comment *attributed* to Josephusreports ....[emphasis mine]".  As for #2, I mentioned in my original post that the long is a 3rd century insert (more properly, post-Origen as Jim notes).There may not be consensus on the short.  The text, which discusses James in alegal role, stands with or without it.  That it does not upset context makes itdifficult to argue insert.  On the other hand, an in-passing insert is easilydisguised in any context.  Nonetheless, on historiographical grounds it is worthless for the messiah defense, and that's why I didn't mention it. I don't know about the Arabic ms.  If you have a translation reference, Jim,please let me know.  As for its "much less gung-ho" tone, obviously the date of this ms. is critical.  If after ca. AD 700, a watered-down entry in lieu of removal can be easily explained.*<(:-)Rich Fox, Anthro, Usouthdakota

Luckily these parameters are fixed by reality.Suppose X-ist saucers land.  The aliens destroy all paper currency and tattoo"666" on people's foreheads and start sacrificing small children.  Then abunch of other aliens come along and offer to get rid of the X-ists in returnfor one dollar.  The people happen to have a single dollar bill hidden duringthe purge.Get the point?  None of these events are *inherently* impossible.  So it isnot the case that the value of a dollar bill is fixed by reality.For a more mundane example of how the value of a dollar bill is not constant,consider the following game thought up by the RAND corporation:You are with a bunch of friends.  You have a $10 bill.  You offer to sell the$10 bill to the highest bidder -- subject to the restriction that you alsoget to take the money bid by the second-highest bidder.Try it.  You'll find that sometimes people will end up bidding more than $10for your $10 bill.mathew

I examined a critique of the Book of Romans byI think, Benjamin Franklin once, a Deist.  I found it amazing thatBenjamin Franklin missed the whole boat.   I also have the writingson Thomas Jefferson sitting on my shelf, and it is amazing howmuch he missed.  I have studied Plato's Theory of Forms and Aristotelian Hylomorphesism.  What a pile of junk.  Jesusmakes Plato and Aristotle look like kindergardeners.  Psychology,the id, ego, superego by Freud?  Elements of truth, but Jesusexplained it far better and gave reasons.Thomas Paine, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson are mere men.  Theycan screw up the Bible just as well as any man.  I do not put thesemen on a pedestal.  And if I remember T.J.'s autobiography correctly,he thought Thomas Paine was the most unread man he ever met.Here's some more circular reasoning to you.  Paul says to the Corinthiansthat "that the gospel will be foolishness to the world, because it is spiritually discerned."  And so, people without the spirit of God haven't aclue to what the Bible is saying.   From your point of view, that'sincredibly circular and convenient.   To me, it is mysteriously and supernaturallybizarre.   I can see it, but you can't.  This is not arrogance onmy part.  Trust me.  It is as bizarre to you as it is to me.  But nonetheless,it is a truth, explainable or not.Are any of you color blind to red and green?  I am.  Remember thosedot tests they do at the optomologist's?  They put pictures in frontof you and you are supposed to identify the pattern in the dots?  Ifyour eyes are perfectly normal, you can see letters or numeralsembedded in the dots.  They are a slightly different color and standout from the background.  But if you are color blind to red and green,you will not see anything but gray-shaded dots.  That is how a dottest appears to me.  I do not see a pattern at all.A normal seeing person will see the patterns.  And to him, I seem like atotal anomaly.  To him, I appear as if I am missing the universe or something.It is hard for him to understand why I can't see anythingthat to him is as plain as day.That it what it is like with the Bible, the Word of God, to the believer.The believer can see the meaning in the words.  I can see how the patternsfit together.  There is such depth.  Such consistency.   But then, on theother hand, I notice the non-believer.   He doesn't see it.  He thinksI am weird because he thinks I am seeing things.   I look at him, andsay, "No, you are weird.  You do not see."   Then it is time for a sanitycheck.  I go to another Christian and say, "Do you see this."  Andthey go, "Yes.  It is an "X"".  And I say, "Thank God, I see the "X"too."It is truly the strangest thing.   It adds a little extra dimension tothe phrase,          "He will make the blind see, and the deaf hear."I am glad that Jesus has enabled me to see.  I wish every non-believercould see what they are missing.

It was largely the mainstream Christian's disgust#at such practices as polygamy which resulted in their irrational hatred.True, but that is exactly the "problem": the Mormon extermination orderwas issued not just by a Christian, it was ALLOWED under the Constitutionof the United States, which was instituted precisely to prevent incidentslike this "order" from occurring in the first place...  As I indicated inan earlier posting, your "irrational hatred" is clearly evidenced byindividuals like Robert Weiss (who could have been Gov. Boggs' Lieutenant;he would have fitted right in, drewling et al), and seems a modern-dayoccurrence, based on results (slander, persecution, misrepresentation,lies, denying Mormons representation in their own user group, etc. etc.In intent and purpose, what really has changed?#The situation is not entirely different today.  Many irrational feelings#and beliefs are justified through religion.  I don't think most of them#are started because of religion, but religion certainly helps justify and#perpetuate prejudices and practices by providing a neat justification#which discourages critical thought.True, as evidenced by numerous examples, as I am sure you're aware.#>In any regard, Mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities (and#>I don't even discuss how Uthan's were suckered into allowing part of their#>lands in becoming nerve-gas and atomic bomb testing grounds...) is far from#>being trusted or righteous.  Have things really changed for the better?  I#>may be a born cynic, but I have NO reason whatsoever that such has been the#>case. In the early 1980s, I believe, the late President Kimball (lds church#>leader) strongly protested federal attempts to locate the MX-"Peace Keeper"#>missile maze from being built in Utah (yet another "inspired" decision from#secular authorities).  Fortunately, his opposition was influential enough#for the feds to back off.##Do you mean that the "secular authorities" are some continuous group of#people with the common and uninterrupted goal of harrassing/eradicating the#Mormons?

You seem to be searching for enemy ^^^^^^^^(Correction: the majority of Utahn's ARE Mormon (60-70% I believe, up to a 100% in many cities and settlements throughout the Western states.)#conspiracies.  It is paranoid to believe that everything that affects you#badly must have been done primarily for that purpose.What I mean is that secular authorities are to be watched, as we believethat Satan has been given some power and dominion over the earth to diverttruth, judgment, and justice.  In addition, we believe that the adversaryhas power to influence the unjust and idolatrous (greed for money would bea good example) in order to bring about persecution, war, oppression, andevil combinations.  As an intelligent being, don't you suppose that thedestroyer would yield his influence foremost on those with political power?As far as Utah is concerned, what I pointed out were some horrible examplesof environmental nightmares imposed upon by secular authorities, which havebrought death, disease, (i.e. the "downwinders") and environmental contami-nation.  I am hardly "paranoid," I am just not "expecting" too much from asecular government that may not share our values and faith, and which indeed(as Gov. Boggs et al.) may be out to harm and destroy us.  As a matter offact, prophecies in my church indicate that in future years, (global)persecution against Mormons will so increase in intensity and scope, that(paraphrasing) "all those who wish to escape persecution and murder mustflee to Zion."  Zion (the "pure in heart") will be re-established in thosedays, and it AIN'T our current secular authorities who will rule over it...#>...

Are we speaking of the origins of life, the humanspecies, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?2) Science cannot explain origins.This is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It dependson what origins we are talking about.3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of originsis to say that there is no higher truth than science.Again, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of "highertruth" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are waysto ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they evenbelieve that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Manybelieve that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the languageof science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither "higher" or "lower"; they are simply true.More to the point, restricting one's discussion of origins to sciencedoes not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts thescope of discussion.4) This is a false premise.If this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was falsethen (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as anotherfalse [or at least theologically unsound] statement.5) By the way, I enjoy science.On the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of scienceto enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well saythat one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read.However one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy,perhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.6) It is truly a wonder observing God's creation.Let us not quibble; count this one as true.7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percentreligion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]Still another false statement.  However one can make it come out truewith the following contextual modification:"Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percentof what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent ofwhat Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion."-----It is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touchon truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I dohim the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to hispersonal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis thathe has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.-- Richard Harter: SMDS Inc.

Elizabeth Bartley) writes:>I can certainly see opposing the "Amen" -- but that doesn't require >opposing a moment of silence.I already responded to this on one dimension, but afterthoughts causeme to make another, independent reply.  The problem with a "moment ofsilence" is that it is NOT an even-handed way of "allowing" for religionamongst students in the public schools.  As I noted before, Muslims needmore than a moment of silence in order to perform the prayers they arerequired by Muhammad to do.  And (at least Orthodox) Jewish prayer alsohas requirements that are not addressed by this.There is, in fact, a highly selective BIAS towards Christian prayer inthis "moment of silence" shit.  And that is especially bizarre in thatChristian prayer DOESN'T NEED this stuff -- a Christain may pray totallyincognito AT ANY TIME (to some extent, this is true of Muslims and Jewsas well -- what I intend in my first paragraph is that there *are* somecharacteristic forms of prayer in *these* religions which DO need specialtimes and/or behavior, which cannot be undertaken without an observer being able taking note of it.)A Christian may pray, at ANY time -- silently and without any trace ofhis activity being evident to others.  That may or may not be true of theother religious traditions amongst us: certainly, these tend to have SOMEforms of prayer that WOULD evidence differences from American/Protestant"mainstream" religion.All that a "moment of silence" does is to allow THAT ONE tradition whichdoesn't NEED it, to have a "special" place set aside in the public schools.There is NOTHING in Christian prayer that requires public forms, or rugs,or phylacteries, or anything else at all visible to the outside world.  AChristian student MAY (and probably does) pray at innumerable times duringthe day, without anyone else knowing it.  [That may also be true of non-Christians -- I am not claimng otherwise].  In the "moment of silence" itwould STILL be difficult for the Jews to gather and daven, for the Muslimsto do their ablutions and find qiblah to Mecca and engage in the prescribedforms.  But *of course* Christians can do *their* thing -- and therefore,the provision is nothing but a disguised attempt to encourage just that.Luckily, there *is* a strong Jewish presence in this country (and I, asa Christian, revere some of the Jewish teachers I had in public schools),and a growing Muslim presence as well.  I can only hope that the politicalforces consequent on this will PREVENT the imposition of Christian formson non-Christians.As far as I can see (as a Christian) there is NOTHING in this "moment ofsilence" campaign but an attempt to use PUBLIC social pressure to FORCEchildren to adhere to a pattern that is biased towards Christianity.  Andas a Christian, I *must* protest such coercion.  For what it's worth, Isuspect that the coercion is not really targeted at the non-Christians --it is yet another case of FAILURE amongst Christian parents in "making"their children prayerful, so that they want the public schools to teachwhat THEY cannot manage to teach, despite having all the opportunity inthe world to do so.If you have taught your children to pray, they do NOT need a moment ofsilence in school.  If you have NOT managed to teach them, the momentwill only embarrass you.  Give it up.-- Michael L.

Remember what Spock said:"the needs of the few outweight the needs of the many".As long as government spending does not contradict the ConstitutionI don't see any problems in a case where the people have selected a group of people to make decisions in one direction. And if this is bad, then we should elect a new government. Democratic systems workthis way, and I don't have anything against you raising an opinionin your case. I just hope you realize that each individual should make theirown judgement, and posting pre-filled letters sounds like youdon't trust your fellow Americans to utter their own opinion,just your own.Cheers,Kent---sandvik@newton.apple.com.

Robert Weiss writes [a promise from Psalm 9:10]>Gee, since you wouldn't be at all hypocritical, you must be really>busy arguing against these out-of-context extracted translations!He directed a similar accusation of hypocrisy, again based on a lack ofresponse to an article by Robert Weiss, toward Stephen.I pointed out that I did, in fact, agree that both Robert Weiss andJim Meritt took quotes out of context.  Hence, I find it difficult tounderstand why Jim thinks I am a hypocrite.  Needless to say, I don'thave time to reply to *every* article on t.r.m. that takes a quoteout of context.  I asked Jim the following:>}So, according to you, Jim, the only way to criticize one person for>}taking a quote out of context, without being a hypocrite, is to post a>}response to *every* person on t.r.m who takes a quote out of context?Jim replied by saying >Did I either ask or assert that?But today we find four articles from Jim, one of which has the subject"Silence is concurrence":  m23364@mwunix.mitre.org (James Meritt) writes:>Is it not the case that, in the eyes of the law, when someone is aware of>something and has the capability of taking action and does not, that individual>may be held responsible for that action?Which is, of course, a complete red herring.  Taking quotes out ofcontext isn't a crime.  I don't have time to read every article ont.r.m., and I'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them all.Does "silence is concurrence" imply that Jim thinks that because Ididn't respond to Weiss' articles I must condone Weiss' taking quotesout of context?  Jim doesn't want to give a direct answer to thisquestion; read what he has written and decide for yourself.But back to the context of my conversation with Jim.  Jim's next gambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when heconcluded that I was being a hypocrite.  I challenged him to providethe details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion.Today we find another obscure article (posting it twice didn't helpmake it more clear, Jim), titled "Inductive Logic":>Scenario:>A white goose waddles past the door>A white goose waddles past the door>A white goose waddles past the door>...( repeat an uncountably large number of times)...>A black goose waddles past the door.  An individual hits it with an axe.>>1. Given that the population of geese is uncountably large, and the size of the>   confidence interval for the decision is undetermined, under what conditions>   could a decision upon the behavior of the individual towards white geese>   be made?>>2. If ONLY black geese are observed to be axed, is it not a valid question >   to be concerned with the different behavior between black and white geese?More red herrings.  Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably largenumber of my articles?  Could Jim mean that because I "axed" his articles,but not Weiss' articles, he wants to conclude inductively ...Well, I can't see where he is going with this.But I can help him with his induction.  I've written roughly 80articles since January.  The vast majority of them are discussions withFrank DeCenso and other inerrantists, where I take the position thatthey are making bad arguments.  Some are discussions with Jim Merittwhere I take the position that he is making bad arguments (a straw manargument earlier, and taking quotes out of context more recently.)Think hard about this Jim.  See the pattern?  Think harder.  Run itthrough your induction engine and see what pops out.  dj

Your conclusion waswrong, of course, since I agree that both you and Robert Weiss wereguity of taking verses out of context.  Nothing hypocritical aboutthat, is there?  Since you reached a false conclusion, you made some mistake in your"logic."  The only question is where.  Did you think that it wouldbe hypocritical for me not to post a reply to Robert Weiss' articles?Did you make the common creationist error of confusing a lack ofevidence for X with evidence for the lack of X?   Is your grasp ofinductive logic not quite as firm as you think? See if you can figureout what your mistake was, and learn from it.dj

Such things are derived from Biblcaltexts through the centuries by the apocolic fathers of the faith.You are right that people read things differently in the Bible, and thisis alright in parts like parables and such forth. However, when it comesto the essential doctrines of the Historical Orthodox Christan Beliefs,there is only one correct way to read it. For example, either thedoctrine of the Trinity is true, or it is false. Yes, people read thetexts differently, but only one position is true. They both cannot be.According to the text, the doctrine is true and has always existed.Therefore, when people like Joseph Smith come along with a vision andthinks he can undo centuries of a doctrine that is supported by theBible, people consider him a cult.

Indeed, many traditions presentan interpretation where believers are supposed to interpretloving one's neighbor as following various other rules, andrelying on their god to make things come out right, preciselybecause it would be wrong for man to assume such "ultimateresponsibility." Once again, we are confronted with good soundinggoo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean. > ...

Thereare many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforwardreading show the Christian god behaving in just this way.Michael cannot refer to "base" claims or base commandments toshow that such readings are "twisted," because this divergence inunderstanding occurs even in trying to interpret the "base"claims and commandments.  In addressing conservative Christians,Michael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notionsthat these conservative Christians will reject.  > But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our> society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It> may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems> -- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.But these base commandments are too vague to serve as  "aprinciple for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems." The meaning ofthese base commandments for any believer derives from the secularand cultural notions that the believer brings to them, from howthe believer mixes their demands with straightforward readings ofother Biblical passages, from a particular sectarian tradition,or from some combination of these things.  These commandmentslack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis forcriticizing ethical systems.  What meaning they have comes fromthe ethical system the believer brings to these commandments. > And different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged> *different* "ethical systems" (or in some cases, none).

There are *many*parables and teachings the gospels attribute to Jesus that arestraightforwardly read as ethical commandments.  The Paulineepistles are similarly full.  If it is not clear that these allcome together in a sensible understanding of ethical behavior,the problem is *not* a lack of raw material. -*----> I am a "radical" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.No, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel seriously.  What differentiates you is the way you interpret thegospel.> ...

It tells us that the New Testamentauthors left a sufficiently vague hodge-podge that it can serveas the source text for many, vastly different beliefs about thenature of the Christian god and about what men should andshouldn't do. The irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity perse that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians andgays.  *Every* Christian principle he turns to this cause iseffective only through the extra-Christian principles throughwhich Michael interprets his religion, and the homophobes applythe *same* Christian principles, with equal justification, totheir cause.  In short, it is the extra-Christian principles thatmake Michael's Christianity beneficial, and I suspect they wouldbe as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered byChristian interpretation.  Michael paints a picture of "standard American atheism" as therejection of the evil in many conservative Christianinterpretations of the Bible.  But I think it is even moredamaging to Christianity to note that the New Testament presentssuch a vague hodge-podge of notions about the nature of God andthe nature of the good (except, of course, when it is ordered byan interpretation that relies on extraneous principles).  Here, Ithink we should apply a Christian parable, where a cold drink canhave its value and a hot drink can have its value, but thelukewarm we should spit out. Russell

But there are some very important related facts that           Christians are COMPLETELY IGNORANT of, as are followers of           most other world religions.                           First, Jesus Christ was NOT unique, John 3:16 NOTWITH-          STANDING.  There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master           (God Incarnate) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES,           a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY, both before and           after the life of Jesus.                    The followers of some of these Masters founded the           world's major religions, usually PERVERTING the teachings of           their Master in the process.  Christians, for example, added           THREATS of "ETERNAL DAMNATION" in Hell, and DELETED the           teaching of REincarnation.                       Secondly, and more importantly, after a particular           Master physically dies and leaves this world, there is           NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively           few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY           alive.  (THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE           UNIVERSES.)                                            Therefore, all those Christians who worship Jesus, and           pray to Jesus, and expect Jesus to return and save them from           their sins, are only KIDDING THEMSELVES, and have allowed           themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly           MANUFACTURED by the Romans.                      And emotional "feelings" are a TOTALLY DECEIVING           indicator for religious validity.                    These things are similarly true for followers of most           other major world religions, including Islam.                     Thirdly, the primary function of each Master is to tune           His Initiates into the "AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM" or "SOUND           CURRENT", (referred to as "THE WORD" in John 1:1-5, and as           "The River of Life" in Revelation 22:1), and to personally           guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they           are still connected to their living physical bodies by a           "silver cord".                    True Salvation, which completes a Soul's cycles of           REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved           only by reaching at least the "SOUL PLANE", which is five           levels or universes above the physical universe, and this           canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine           Master.                    One such Divine Master alive today is an American, Sri           Harold Klemp, the Living "Eck" Master or "Mahanta" for the           "Eckankar" organization, now headquartered in Minneapolis,           (P.O. Box 27300;  zip 55427).                    Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, now           living in Punjab, India, and is associated with the "Sant           Mat" organization.                      One of the classic books on this subject is "THE PATH OF           THE MASTERS" (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA            90247), written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson, a theologian           and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India           studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of           that time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji.                    Several of the Eckankar books, including some authored           by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp, can be found in           most public and university libraries and some book stores, or           obtained thru inter-library loan.  The book "ECKANKAR--THE           KEY TO SECRET WORLDS", by Sri Paul Twitchell, is ANOTHER           classic.                    Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with           the "Anti-Christ", which is or was to be a temporary world           dictator during the so-called "last days".  But the Masters           don't ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as           Jesus was.                    People who continue following Christianity, Islam, or           other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master, will           CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation, between the           Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world, until they           finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine           Master.                             RE-INCARNATION                         The book "HERE AND HEREAFTER", by Ruth Montgomery,           describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation           as a FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past           lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes           makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist],           SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of           whom can identify their most recent previous relatives,           homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experi-          ences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while travel-          ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read-          ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS           FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the           Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How           can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED           BEFORE?!).  [ ALWAYS use the "KING JAMES VERSION".  Later           versions are PER-VERSIONS! ]                          Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc.,           typically originate from a person's PAST LIVES.  For example,           a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually           results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.            And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to           another person being met for the first time in THIS life,           because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS           INCARNATION.                The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF           KARMA (Galatians 6:7, Revelation 13:10, etc.).  People would           behave much better toward each other if they knew that their           actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the           future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION!           "2nd COMINGS"               If a Divine Master physically dies ("translates")           before a particular Initiate of His does, then when that           Initiate physically dies ("translates"), the Master will meet           him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul           Plane.  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd           Coming.  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience, NOT something that           happens for everyone all at once.  People who are still           waiting for Jesus' "2nd Coming" are WAITING IN VAIN.                                   PLANES OF EXISTENCE               The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN           major levels of existence.  Above the Physical Plane is the           Astral Plane, the Causal Plane, the Mental Plane, the Etheric           Plane (often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane),           the Soul Plane, and several higher Spiritual Planes.  The           Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN, (counting upward from           the Physical).  The planes between (but NOT including) the           Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes.                    It is likely that ESP, telepathy, astrological           influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [See           the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without           an apparent physical origin, result from INTERACTIONS between           the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane.                    The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED.  For example, a           sub-plane of the Astral Plane is called "Hades", and the           Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it, created there           LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some           kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a           THREATENING manner.  The Christian "Heaven" is located           elsewhere on the Astral Plane.  Good Christians will go there           for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth.                                         SOUND CURRENT vs. BLIND FAITH               The Christian religion demands of its followers an           extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more           than GOOD FEELING (which is TOTALLY DECEIVING).                       If a person is not HEARING some form of the "SOUND           CURRENT" ("THE WORD", "THE BANI", "THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM"),           then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL           CONTINUE.                    The "SOUND CURRENT" manifests differently for different           Initiates, and can sound like a rushing wind, ocean waves on           the sea shore, buzzing bees, higher-pitched buzzing sound, a           flute, various heavenly music, or other sounds.  In Eckankar,           Members start hearing it near the end of their first year as           a Member.  This and other experiences (such as "SOUL TRAVEL")           REPLACE blind faith.

But when we are dealing with a fanaticalRevelation preacher that kills ultimately everyone, including theinnocent children, then it seems that we are dealing with Christians and christians (note the spelling). > Do you judge all Muslims by the acts committed by Saddam Hussein, a > supposedly devout Muslim?

Had the Branch Davidians takentheir case to court, the black eye the BATF earned themselves wouldhave been multiplied many times over.I also mourn the deaths of the BATF agents although the deceptionscarried out against them by our government were nothing compared tothe atrocities against the Branch Davidians.Attorney General "Vampira" claims to have made the best decision shecould based on the information she was given. This is possible. Officialsin higher positions than hers have been duped. We have no choice sowe may as well give her another chance. Even if she is truly evil,it is doubtful that she'll kill more than a few hundred at a time.I'm considering joining the NRA.Finally, I have one question: What happened to the Federal agents thathad supposedly infiltrated the Branch Davidians' organization (andstarted this whole debacle)?-------------------------------------------------------------------Rick Roy       Usenet: rick@howtek.MV.com       America Online: QEDDisclaimer: My employer's views are orthogonal to these.The early bird got worms.

(Just as one should not be compelled to pay for lipposuctioncoverage if ONE doesn't WANT that kind of coverage).A full third of the country flatly considers abortion to be murderfor reasons of conscience.  If the first amendment means ANYTHING at allanymore, then these people should NOT be COMPELLED to PAY for "abortioncoverage" if it is so OBVIOUSLY offensive to their beliefs.

All you have done is>put doubt on who started the fire without providing any evidence to back>up your claim that the FBI was responsible.In my opinion, it is possible that the actions of the FBI: a) indirectly,b) directly but not intentionally, or c) intentionally (I hope not thelatter, but we would be naive to discount this possibility entirely) causedthe fire. It is possible that someone inside the community startedthe fire because they "thought" God told them to or because they simplywould rather die than surrender. Who knows? We are left with some compelling questions here, besides the above. Whyhaven't the droves of news reporters commented on whether or not theyheard shots coming from within the compound once the tank (I don'tremember its technical name) started ramming down the door? It seemsto me that gunshots would be audible at 2.5 to 3 miles away.Why couldn't the FBI wait until Koresh wrote his manuscript, as theyhad promised they would. Does the fact that Koresh lied justify theFBI's lying as well?Will an "internal investigation" really reveal what happened, if in factthe BATF and FBI are at least partly to blame?How will we ever know if Koresh broke the law as was alleged in thenow-unsealed (finally!) warrant? Certainly we won't find out in acourt of law.There's been a lot of talk about why the people didn't run out whenthe fire started, but one survivor said that the tank had collapsed thestairway and entryway and that the majority of the people were trapped.Only those in another part of the house escaped.People have commented on the unwillingness of the woman who came runningout of the house with her clothes ablaze to remain outside rather thangoing back in. When was the last time you had your clothes on fire? Who the heck knows if you'd know which way you were running and why? I thinkthe FBI agent who grabbed her and pulled her to safety acted heroically, btw. I'm certainly not trying to paint a picture of the "evil feds" by any means. I simply question the decisions from start to finishthat led to the horrible tragedy of yesterday.>-- >John Mechalas                                          "I'm not an actor, but>mechalas@gn.ecn.purdue.edu                                 I play one on TV.">Aero Engineering, Purdue University                     #include disclaimer.h>

I realize it is > normally tossed out because it contains miracles, but what> are the other reasons?Far from being "tossed out," the gospels are taken, almostuniversally, as the primary source of information about Jesus.I am curious as to whom Mike Cobb is referring.  Who "tosses out"the New Testament?  Undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this,but the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobbascribes this more broadly.Perhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter iswhy, except for some *naive* believers (who, unfortunately, faroutnumber nonbelievers, both naive and critical), are the gospels*not* taken as "gospel truth" that faithfully records just whathappened two thousand years ago?  This has an easy answer, andthe answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is takenthis way by a critical reader.There is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text,measures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms thetext as "historically valid" or "tosses out" the text.  I suspectthis myth comes from the way history is presented in primary andsecondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority,and from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to presenthistorical arguments along these lines for their religiousprogram.  In fact, most texts used in primary and secondaryschool history classes ought to be tossed out, even the bettersuch texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibedabove, and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument ifit bit him on the keister twice.Let me present the barest outlines of a different view of textsand their use in studying history.  First, all texts arehistorically valid.  ALL texts.  Or to put this another way, Ihave never seen a notion of "historical validity" that makes anysense when applied to a text.  Second, no text should be read astelling the "gospel truth" about historical events, in the waythat many students are wont to read history texts in primary andsecondary school.  NO text.  (This includes your favoriteauthor's history of whatever.)Every text is a historical fact.  Every text was written by someperson (or some group of people) for some purpose.  Hence, everytext can serve as historical evidence.  The question is: what canwe learn from a text?  Of what interesting things (if any) doesthe text provide evidence?The diaries of the followers of the Maharishi, formerly ofOregon, are historical evidence.  The gospels are historicalevidence.  The letters of the officers who participated in the vampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence.  Themodern American history textbooks that whitewash "great Americanfigures" are historical evidence.  These are all historicalevidence of various things.  They are *not* much evidence at allthat the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, could levitate; thatJesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that "greatAmerican figures" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school.They are better evidence that some people "saw" the Maharishi,late of Oregon, levitate; that some of the early Christiansthought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe"saw" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have aneducational system that largely prefers to spread myth ratherthan teach history.How does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece ofhistorical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces?  This is avery complex question that has no easily summarized answer.There are many books on the subject or various parts of thesubject.  I enjoy David Hackett Fischer's "Historian's Fallacies"as a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easyto read texts present history.  It's relatively cheap.  It's easyto read.  Give it a try.Russell

They hardlyeven prevented me from masturbating in study hall.I should have thought better of someone posting from a UChicago address.How can you manage to say such nonsense without shame?Muslim students might have a complaint, if they are prevented from settingout their rugs and doing the proper ablutions before prayer at the timesspecified in the Qu'ran.  Jews would probably like the opportunity to davenwith tefillim and whatever else *they* require, at *their* appropriate times.I do not see THEM complaining (though Muslims and Jews have a case that noChristian I have ever heard has been able to make.)The "Christian" insistence on a PUBLIC, UNIVERSAL, ENFORCED "moment ofprayer^H^H^H^H^H^Hsilence" is nothing but the Inquisition "naturalized"into the American context.

Scum has no guilt or freedom tochoose anything.  Griffen does.  God did not make scum when he made Griffen.He made a precious person and this person chose to do wrong.  The same goesfor Dr. Gunn.: But if you are to examine it more closely, Griffen would have preferred that: these children were born -- yet AFTER their birth, did Griffen have any : assistance to offer them?  Did Griffen intend to support them, educate them,: raise them up to be useful citizens?  Did he have any intent whatsoever: to help these children after birth?: Here's the real problem.  Americans have become so insensitive to the needsof others and so completely wrapped up in themselves that they cannot seestraight or think clearly enough to make even the slightest and most obviousmoral decisions based on reality.If a man abandons a woman to care for their child on her own, he is notconsidered to be a very respectable or decent man by anyone.  This man hasfled his responsibility, has behaved like a lazy coward, and has turnedaway from his responsibility to his wife and child.However, if a woman decides to kill her unborn child to release her burden,she is not thought of in the same way.  When the man abandons, the womansuffers but the child is free to grow up and live a happy and normal life.When the woman abandons, the child is diced or killed with saline or vacuumedout, and the man has no choice, and the man sometimes suffers so badly thathe wishes he could trade places with his child.Ths root of this whole problem is selfishness--the arrogance that says, "Myfeelings and desires are supreme and your well being is not worth dung."And when you come down to it, this is the substance of what hell is made of.It's the reason a loving God can throw selfish people to the devil and hisdemons for all of eternity.  Let any one of us unrepentant into heaven, andwe'll ruin it the first chance we get.: Now, I don't really know the answer to these questions, but I've got a real: good guess.: And, it's probably right.: And I wouldn't call *that* 'benevolent', either.: It is a move in the right direction.  As it is now, we don't see ourresponsibility because we kill it and get it out of sight.  The mediabacks us completely.  Real responsibility does not sell.  The only"responsibility" that sells in the marketplace is that which is justenough to make us "feel responsible" without showing anything thatmight show us our own true irresponsibility.  We want to "feel" likegood people, but we want nothing with *being* good people.  Just giveme the freedom to say "I'm good", and the rest of the world can burn.Rape and kill my children and throw my parents to the places wherepoor old folks rot until they're dead.  I'll hate my brother and sisterif I wish and I'll cheat on my wife or husband.  Screw the government,because it screws me, and don't talk to me about giving to the churchbecause church people are all a bunch of money grubbing hypocrites.But, I'm a good person.  At least I admit what I do.  At least I lovemyself and we all know that is the greatest love in the world--not thata man lay down his life for his brother...That sounds too "christian".At the root, this is the substance of what hell is made of.We've become a self indulgant, backslidden society no longer responsibleto our children, to our parents, to our families, to our government, orto our God.  This is the root behind justification of every evil, of everycorruption in government, of every slanderous remark, of every lie, andof every murder.  Society cannot continue to live like this long.  it willhave to destroy itsself soon, and perhaps in the end, that will be thebiggest blessing this world can hope to see.Why do people see so much evil in trying to turn this situation around?-------------------------------------------------------------------------"I deplore the horrible crime of child murder... We want prevention, not merely punishment. We must reach the root of the evil... It is practiced by those whose inmost souls revolt from the dreadful deed... No mater what the motive, love of ease,or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent,the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed... but oh! thrice guilty is he who drove herto the desperation which impelled her to the crime."- Susan B.

I respond.     The question that was raised was not if Jesus went to infernal Paradise     before entering into heaven. No one has made a point for or against      that issue, nor have they compared the LDS position against orthodox     belief. The infernal paradise is held to be Abraham's bosom (Luke 16),      the place of the righteous dead in sheol (equivalent to hades).     The point that was raised by John was that someone could not repent     on their death bed. Tom Albrecht pointed to a Biblical example that was     contradictory to what John's position put forward. The thief on the      cross was promised by Christ to be with Him in Paradise, the abode of      the righteous dead. John's position possibly needs to be reworked.     Kermit needs to address the topic at hand.=============================Robert Weisspsyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu

There is norational reason to give an "abortionist" a "value" 10 million times thatof a fetus.  (Why not 10 billion, for instance...oh, but then you wouldloose on the deal.)Instead we should look at what is *really* involved in each abortion.There is the loss of a human life, a life that would otherwise haveeventually become a member of society.  That is certainly a non-zerovalue.  There is the physical and emotional suffering of a woman whofinds herself with an unwanted pregnancy, and the greater sufferingcaused by the refusal of society to allow her to deal with it.  Thatwoman is *already* a member of society.I argue that the cost of suffering of a *real* member of society isfar greater than the loss of a *potential* future member of society.Now, as for your "deal".  Suppose you "pay" the value of all the sufferingof every woman who *was* denied an abortion, or *would have been* deniedan abortion, under your desired position.  And "we" will "pay" the valueof all the potential future members of society that never became a part ofit (or *would* not have been a part of it, under *our* desired position).Think about it.Of course, I expect you will object to my argument that suffering ofon-going life is worse than loss of just-starting life.  If so, pleaseput forth some rational argument for how the life of a (currently)non-sentient creature is somehow worth the suffering of a sentient being.(I figure if I ask enough places, and such an arguement exists, I shouldeventually see it.)-Rob

For example, in chemistry someone may predictthe outcome of a chemical reaction and then actually observe that reaction repeatedly. You can't repeat or ever know for sure the original conditions thatproduced life. So it seems we could never say, "That's exactly how it happened."As far as we know that event was unobserved. (At least no one has admittedit. :-) ) So unlike the chemistry experiment repeatability and observability,strictly speaking, are lacking.-- +----------------------------------------------------------+| Joe Duffy                          duffy@asl.dl.nec.com  || NEC America, Inc.                                        |

Also, a book (by a homosexual author whose nameescapes me at the moment) called "Homosexuals in History" asserts that Roehmand Heines were homosexuals, as well as others in Roehm's SA circle.>All the books say that Roehm and his associate, Edmund Heines,>were homosexual.  I have been able to find nothing beyond that, and>suspect this to be a sort of historical urban legend. Well, you're the one who is in Germany. If you don't believe the history books,look up the primary sources yourself. Those of us outside of Germany do nothave access to these. You do. It seems to me that there were plenty ofdocumented instances - several scandals, the fact that on the "knight of thelong knives" several SA members (including Heines) were found sleepingtogether, etc. Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA'shomosexual activities (seducing young boys, etc). The histories that I've read make a very convincing case. None of this sounds like urban legend to me. >(Irving, a>notoriously unreliable historian, says that Funk, the Nazi finance>minister, was homosexual.  He gives no sources.)I know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk. What precisely doyou know, that would contradict all of the other history books that I haveread concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis? Are you trying to say that all historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear? What about homosexual writers who agree with the official history? Don't you think they would have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals?I would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one should use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case. >I challenge anyone to document this claim.If you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just Irving),then the burden of proof is on you. Track down the references. Find out wherethe stories originate from. Again, you are the one in Germany, close toarchival material - most people on the net are not.>I *have* found a great>deal of evidence that there were many flaming heterosexuals among the>Nazis.  This seems to include all of the worst ones--Hitler, Himmler,>Goebbels, Goering, Heydrich, Eichmann, and many more.Eh? What is your agenda here? To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals, sothat you can bash heterosexuals? Does it bother you that some of the Nazismight have been homosexuals? Does this make all homosexuals bad if this istrue? Of course not. And what about bisexuals? Are they half-Nazis?I don't know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis werehomosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notoriousfor its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the Germangovt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser's friendswere prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a longtradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history -back to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a product of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like theEnglish public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality,would have been quite willing to overlook Roehm's homosexuality.In addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. TheHitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various pre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote homoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So it seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis, regardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the "evils" of homosexuality.Why should this suprise anyone? Homosexuality has always existed, in all societies - it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception.No, I don't have any sources for you, as I think the only kind of proof youwill accept would be citations from archival material, and I do not have access to these. Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modernhomosexuality that I have ever read - I don't have the time. Nothing isstopping you, however, from chasing down those sources. Until you proveotherwise, though, I will stick with the established histories.                                                                           /\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/David Matthew Deane (deane@binah.cc.brandeis.edu)"...Be in me as the eternal moods of the bleak wind...Let the Gods speak softlyof us in days hereafter..."

(Just as one should not be compelled to pay for lipposuction>coverage if ONE doesn't WANT that kind of coverage).There are "basic services" and there are "optional services", Dennis. Call waiting is an optional service, but having the number "3" work on one's phoneis a basic service. Just because some nutcase doesn't happen to use the "3"on his phone, since none of the numbers he calls has a "3" in it, doesn't mean that he has the right to demand that the phone company "unbundle" the chargesfor the use of each phone digit; an unbundling that would be horrendouslyinefficient because of all the billing & bookkeeping overhead. Similarly, abortion can be seen as a "basic service".Furthermore, public funding of abortion SAVES money, as well as being, in the views of a substantial portion of the population, probably a clear majority, an ethical thing to do. If you don't like saving money on your taxes in that way, why don't you take the taxes you save and invest in private charities with programs that help reduce the NEED for abortion. If every pro-lifer did the same, it would create a massive economic negative feedback loop which would all but ELIMINATE the need for public funding of abortion. Then you would get your wish. And, you know what? No pro-choicer I know would stopyou carrying out that plan. They might even HELP you with it...- Kevin

TheBATF agents were thus definitively shot by the will of God himself. Ican't see why they needed the million rounds of ammo though in thatcase.If you have some Koresh material that hasn't gone to the net then pleasesend it to me. In particular I really do want to see the book of Koresh,but no making one up please. I want the real Mcoy, the one the Fedsdiscoverd on the third day in a box with seven seals and are suppressing.I will editorialize for the benefit of the net to produce a "definitive"history. I would prefer though to have genuine rather than made to measure Koreshia.There are plenty of genuinly unhinged loons so as to not need to startmaking it up. Of course if you are an unhinged loon then I want to hearfrom you.Phill Hallam-BakerPS Libel suits not welcome.

What'sgoing on? I will pass on psychologizing answers (whether dismissive or moreopen) as not the kind of issue to deal with here -- the question is what isthe *theological* point involved?  And it has been quoted "at" me oftenenough by those who don't believe I take it seriously, that Jesus (is saidto have) said, "If you love me, you will obey my commands."  [John 14:15]I am, like any Christian, the slave of Christ, and it is my will that Ishould do as He wills me to do.  I am (also, or instead) His younger brother,but still under His direction, though we both call God "Abba."  Christians,therefore, will try to find what it is that their Lord commands them, anddiscovering it will feel obligated to do it, or to confess their failure.Readers here may set aside the theologizing jargon (such as "slaves ofChrist") -- the point is that adherents of a religion *will* read the texts(whether classified as "inspired" or not) that are held up as models, in aneffort to find application to their own situations.  This practice rangesfrom "devotional" reading of sermons and the like to the exegesis of canon-ical scripture as "the Word of God."  And at the highest pitch, this leadsto a question of whether we *can* find in inspired scripture something thatcan act as "absolute" guidance for our actions.The problem is in finding out just *what* it is our Lord commands.  I amgoing to set aside for this essay one major direction in which Christianshave looked for these commands, namely Christian tradition.  That is notbecause *I* reject tradition, but because my primary audience in this essayis Protestants, who deny tradition a determinative value, in favor of thewitness of Scripture.  The question I want to deal with is, WHAT commandmentscan we find from our Lord in Scripture?  And that turns out to be a hardquestion.  [ If any of my Protestant Inquisitors would *like* to turn thediscussion to the authority of tradition, I can accomodate them :-), unlike*most* Protestants, Episcopalians admit claims from a) Scripture b) Reasonand c) Tradition on roughly equal standing. ]Earlier in John than my quote above, we read [John 13:34] "I give you a new commandment: love one another."  This is the ONLY place in the NT whereChristians are given an explicit commandment, with the context commentingon its imperative mode pronouncement by Jesus.  At the same meal [so we*readers* infer, since it is *not* in John, but in the Synoptics] Jesussays, "Take this [bread]; this is my body."  [Mark 14:22, cf. Matthew 26:26,Luke 22:19, 1 Corinthians 11:24]  The mode is imperative (Greek _labete_),and hence this, too, is a "commandment."In *both* cases we have to *infer* that the command is directed to a widercircle than the immediate collocation of disciples -- because we judge theevangelist's point in mentioning it (with the disciples by then mostly orentirely dead) is that *we* are expected to follow this as a commandmentfrom our Lord.  In the case of communion, Paul's mention (at least; thisis probably true of the evangelists also) implies an ongoing ritual liturgyin which these words operate to "bind" Christians to the original commandto his disciples, as a continuing commandment to the Christian community.I am entirely comfortable with this inference, but I *must* point out thatit is THERE, between us and the occasion on which Jesus spoke the command.I take it as a clear inference, at the very least the EVANGELIST'S notion,that *all* Christians are called to love one another, in Jesus' commanddirected at the disciples.  But I have to call attention to the inference.The command CANNOT apply to me without the generalization from the specificcontext of its statement to my own context as a "disciple" of Christ.All reading of scripture has to make such inferences, to get any sense outof the text whatsoever.  This is a general problem in reading these texts-- we cannot read them at all without our *own* understanding of our nativelanguages in which we (normally) read the (translated) texts, and without*some* appreciation of the original context (and at points, the originallanguages, when English misleads us.) I am going to presume, in what follows,that we have the *general* problem of how to read scripture under control[ I don't *really* think this is true, but it will suffice for my currentpurposes. ]  I will address ONLY the issues that arise when we have alreadycoped with the understanding of a 2000 year old text from another worldthan the one we live in.  Questions at THAT level only introduce MORE reser-vations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that wecan read the texts as the original audience might have done.Among the reasons we have for seeing John's _agapate allelou_ as a *general*commandment (not merely an instruction by Jesus to this disciples on thatone occasion), and one linking it to the Synoptic "Great Commandment" isthat we have criticism, from Jesus, about limiting our love to those whomwe congenially associate with.  In Matthew 5:43ff we read, "You have learnthow it was said: 'You must love your neighbor' and hate your enemy.  But Isay to you: love your enemies."  In fact, the Leviticus context quoteddoes NOT say 'hate your enemy' -- it is merely the common human presumption.(And Leviticus is at pains to say that the "love" should extend to strangersamongst the people of Israel.)  Luke, in expanding on this same Q context,goes on to have Jesus say. "Even sinners love those who love them." [6:27]All of this suggests [quite strongly, I'd say :-)] that *limiting* thescope of the "new commandment" is not quite what Jesus has in mind.  Inshort, inference *leads me* to generalizing the actual text to a commandthat is "in force" on Christians, and with objects not limited to otherChristians.Trickier than the _agapate allelou_ or Institution of communion, there isthe case of the "Great Commission" where (Matthew 10, Mark 6) the Twelveare sent out to evangelize, "Proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is closeat hand."  The verb is imperative (_ke:russete_), but the context is ratherspecific to the Twelve, and there are further specifiers (as in "Do notturn your steps to pagan territory, and do not enter any Samaritan town"-- the Lukan parallels are even more specific to Jesus' final journey toJerusalem) which make it harder to see this generalizing to all Christiansthan the previous examples.  That hasn't prevented Christians from MAKINGsuch an inference; what I have to call attention to is that such inferenceis NOT justified in the text, nor (unlike the first two cases I cite) bythe rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader.  Still, Paul seems tohave felt obliged to "proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand"even (contrary to Jesus' instructions to the 12 :-)) to the gentiles, tothe ends of the earth.  So, Christians after him have also taken this asa "commandment" in the sense of John 14:15.  Do I "accept" this?  I don'tknow.  It is surely rather speculative.  But you see how the ripples ofinference spread out from the text that is the pretext -- Christians (may)infer a general commandment, applicable to all, from what is presented inthe gospels as a specific occasion.  I do not (necessarily) object to thiskind of generalization -- but I *insist* that people who make it *must*have an understanding that they are *reasoning* (at some considerablelength) from what we actually *have* in scripture.  There are *assumptions*involved in this reasoning, and *these* are *not* themselves scriptural(though people will do their best to "justify" their assumptions by OTHERreferences to scripture -- which simply adds MORE inference into the mix!)Let's move on to the "Great Commandment" -- that we should love God withour whole hearts and minds and souls.  This is, perhaps, the Synoptic"equivalent" of John's _agapate allelou_.  And yet,  it is not PRESENTEDas a commandment, in our texts.  Rather, the context is controversy withthe Pharisees.  To cite Matthew [22:34ff]"But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadduceesthey got together and, to disconcert him, one of them put a question,"Master, which is the greatest commandment of the Law?"It is by no means obvious here (though I accept it as such) that Jesus'answer is meant to be a commandment *to Christians*.  He is answering apolemic from his enemies.  [ Mark's account, in  12:28-34 casts the answerin a far more positive light as (so the "scribe" in this version says)"far more important than any holocaust (I need to point out that this wordoriginates in the context of animal sacrifice; forget the Nazis for this)or sacrifice."  Luke is intermediate -- he has a lawyer posing the question"to disconcert" Jesus, and gets the Good Samarian parable for his pains[ Luke 10:25-37 ].  The contexts here are so confusingly various that onecould be forgiven for drawing *no* inferences :-)  In *no* account is thissaid as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding onChristians -- though I think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in eachcase that Jesus thinks it to be so.  The point is that our mental gearsHAVE to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this aboutwhat WE are commanded to do, by Jesus.  And all of this is contingent onour understanding the point of Jesus' use of the Torah in the (all quitedifferent) gospel accounts, and the application of such a context to *us*.The different contexts among the Synoptics are curious.  It should be notedthat ONLY in Luke do we get the "fixing" of this command by the parable ofthe Good Samaritan.  We may look for an analogous *intent* in Matthew, where7:12 gives the "Golden Rule" as "the meaning of the Law and the Prophets"(and where we may also hear an echo of Hillel saying the same, a generationbefore Jesus.)  If we make these associations (which I think are entirelyreasonable), we are -- again -- indulging in inference.  The texts do not*explicitly* support us; rather, we *read* the texts as having this kind ofinter-relationship.  Current literary theory calls this "intertextuality."My discussion of why the _agapate allelou_ "has" to apply beyond the community of the disciples, and beyound the circle of Christian believers,applies again here, to buttress a conclusion that this *is* (despite thepresentation not saying so explicitly) a "commandment" to Christians.Few Christians would disagree with my conclusions -- but I *must* pointout that they *are* conclusions, they *depend* on rather elaborate chainsof reasoning that are simply NOT present in the texts, themselves.The contextual problem keeps coming up, more and more severely as we look atthose sayings of Jesus that are NOT so universally taken by Christians as commandments.  And we get some really hard cases.  Take divorce.  Mark is pretty clear, "The man who divorces his wife and marries another is guiltyof adultery against her."  [ 10:11, cf. Luke 16:18 ] -- except that Matthewhas an escape clause [ "except in the case of fornication", 5:31 ]. Thisseems to be a rather clear "commandment" (whether or not we take Matthew'sreservation); and some Christians, to this day, take it so.  But some don't,at least in practice.  This is rather peculiar; it is not as if Jesus werenot explicit about this (whereas He says nothing at all about some of thethings people gnash their teeth over.)  How is it possible, if the commandsof Christ are clear, that Matthew can so disagree with the other evangelistsof the synoptic tradition?I'm going to continue this examination, into ever-murkier waters, but thisis enough to start with.  The theme is: "finding commandments in scriptureis an exercise in inference; our inferences are informed by OUR assumptions,that is, our own cultural biases."  I have, so far, identified a very few"commandments" that are generally accepted by all Christians -- and yet inthese, already, some of the difficulties start to surface.  It is thesedifficulties I want to discuss in my next essay on this topic.  The divorcecommandment already strikes at some of the difficulties: I see almost noevidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn*me* with, spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soc.couples ormisc.legal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce, or demanding thatUS law refuse to allow it, or refuse "unrepentant divorcees" places intheir churches.  [ That is not to say that divorce *doesn't* enter into consideration in general -- it is most definitely a matter of concern, ineven the most "liberal" church circles.  For example, a (wildly) liberalEpiscopalian priest of my aqauintence, in a (wildly) liberal diocese, hasrecommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a"private" secular ceremony before a judge, so that the "public" ceremonyhe celebrated need not go through an agonizing "examination" by officialswho would just as soon NOT take on this role of interpreting the commandswe are faced with as Christians.  This, in a church that was effectivelyCREATED by a famous divorce! ]-- Michael L.

I know, there is bias,>and winners writing history, but doesn't the principle of firsthand being best>still apply?But given the critical principle, what evidence is there that we haveANYTHING at ALL from "firsthand" sources about Jesus?  Paul's letters areindeed firsthand evidence ABOUT PAUL and his interactions.  They are, asa result, the most historically solid books in the NT.  Paul's claims anddescriptions about his conflicts with Jerusalem may not be "wie es eigent-lich gewesen" -- but they are most definitely the comments of a participant!In other words, we'd evaluate Paul's statements more or less as we wouldthe testimony of a witness in court.The gospels are another story altogether.  Luke is most assuredly NOT afirsthand witness.  He *claims* to have gathered material that is closerto the actual events -- but this is a conventional claim in ancient booksand Luke in fact NEVER NAMES a witness or points to any one thing in hisbook(s) which derive from any source *we* can detect behind Luke.  Johnhas a concluding remark that it derives from the testimony of a beloveddisciple (who is NOT named.)  We are not bound to accept this claim (fora long time, some scholars rejected it outright), but even if we do, itmakes the fourth gospel as we have it *at best* secondhand.  Neither Marknor Matthew make any claims to be firsthand.  Later (much later) Christiantradition associates the first gosple with Matthew and a possible Aramaicproto-gospel, and associates Mark with Peter as having something like thesame second-hand status of recounting Peter's preaching of the gospel.Such traditional claims run into difficulties if we try to evaluate theactual data before us.  Luke and Matthew both appear to use (differently!)an anonymous and not otherwise attested collection of _logoi_ (words anddeeds) of Jesus, as well as to be dependent on Mark.  This makes theirtestimony AT LEAST thirdhand.All that said, historians DO attempt to glean whatever they can from theNT sources, and they are overwhelmingly the obvious and best sources foranything about the earliest Church.  They are also *extremely* importantfor the light they cast (however refracted through Christian biases) onthe sectarian world of Judaism just before and around the time of thedestruction of the 2nd Temple.The problem of "the historical Jesus" is tricky, however.  There is acycle of fashion on this (and we are now near a major "high" in peoplethinking they *can* discern [with historico-critical plausibility] some-thing about Jesus' life and opinions from the NT.  The difficulty here(which dominated thinking 50 years ago, and will probably return to favorin another generation :-)) was pointed out by Bultmann, after Schweitzer'streatment at the end of the previous high-point on the cycle -- simplyBECAUSE all our sources have passed through AT LEAST one layer of quiteanonymous shaping WITHIN the early Church, we have no easy and reliableway to distribute ANY part of the material between "real" history and theinventions of the Church.  There are few "radical skeptics" who think wehave nothing of history in the gospels [though such a position can bemaintained], but neither have we any tools that can distinguish "shaping"of real historical material by its communal use as opposed to "invention."--Michael L.

Here goes...  I am getting married in June to a devout (Wisconsin Synod) Lutheran.  I would classify myself as a strong agnostic/weak athiest.  This has been a a subject of many discussions betweenus and is really our only real obstacle.  We don't have any real difficulties with the religious differences yet, but I expect they will pop up when we have children.  I have agreed to raise thechildren "nominally" Lutheran.  That is, Lutheran traditions, but trying tokeep an open mind.  I am not sure if this is even possible though.  I feel thatthat the worst quality of being devoutly religous is the lack of an open mind.     Anyway, I guess I'll get on with my question.  Is anyone in the same situation and can give some suggestions as to how to deal with this?  We've taken the attitude so far of just talking about it a lot and not letting anything get bottled up inside.  Sometimes I get the feeling we're making this much bigger than it actually is.  Any comments would be greatly appreciated.  Also, please e-mail responses since I don't get a chance to read this groupoften.  :-(Paul

Christian people have caused"objective morality" to look very "relative."  After all, that was thepoint of the original question in this thread, i.e. can we toss outChristianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its ownprinciples?  If you will bear with me, I will attempt to explain thisapparent inconsistency from at least one Christian's viewpoint:If God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims, thenHe has a pretty well-defined concept of what makes people tickphysically, emotionally, etc.  GOD has an "objective" morality for us.That is to say, He has no trouble understanding what is good for (ordetrimental to) the creature He created. Galatians 2:10-- For we [mankind] are His workmanship, created inChrist Jesus for good works [a morality], which God preparedbeforehand [a well-defined design], that we might walk in them.However, contrary to what many people assume (including the Pharaseesof the Bible,) God's morality cannot be completely codified in a listof rules and regulations.  To some extent, every activity of aperson's life creates a new situation to which morality must beapplied.  There never could be enough volumes to codify God's"objective" morality for us. Throughout history, mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list ofrules (objectivity, if you please.)  In the Old Testament, we haveboth principles and specific rules.  By the time of Jesus, most of theprinciples were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules.Volumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify theapplication of the principles.  We [mankind] weren't comfortable withthe "subjectivity" of principles. For reference see Matthew 5 where Jesus explains the differencebetween the Law and the principles of the Law.  For example, inverses 21-22:  "You have heard that the ancients were told,'You shall not commit murder'...and 'Whoever commits murder shallbe liable to the court.'  But I say to you that everyone who isangry with his brother shall be liable to the court..."The "objective morality" of God gets blurred by our ineptinterpretation of it.  We [Christians] have made our biggest errorswhen we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLYwhat God intended for us.  If we [Christians] would stay committed toseeking God's will instead of trying to prove we already had it allfigured out, we might do a better job of allowing others to find God's"objective morality" for themselves.  If Jesus is who he said hewas/is (and that's the fundamental question,) then HE IS "objectivemorality." John Nunnally

Much in the same way that we need BOTH a particle model and awave model for light, the atomic model is a mathematicalrepresentation of physical phenomena.  A model that can andprobably will continue to change over time.  That makes it subjective (the model that is).  However, the model gives us anobjective way to talk about the physical world.To put it another way, the Quantum Mechanical model of the atomallows for discussion of the atom that will give repeatable andunambiguous results, which is objective.  However, as Bohr andEinstein duked it out mid-century, the interpretation ofthose reapeatable, observable measurements is quite subjective.Bohr said that the observable randomness of atomic motion wasinherent in the nature of the universe.  Einstein said particlemotion was deterministic, but it was our measurement shortcomingsthat introduced the randomness.  They were talking about theEXACT same results, though.-jim halat

After he and his brother Hyramwere murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split overwho to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just likeMohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims considerChrist to be a prophet the same as Jews, I'm led to understand.  Makeno mistake, this was no messiah we're talking about in Smith).  Thethought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handeddown father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was onlyentering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to havebeen bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  TheCouncil of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn't of much helphere, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects.Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waitedfor Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The otherclaimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)Both sects practiced the "1-year food stockpile" doctrine,and this being frontier and farming country most carried or atleast owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were amilitaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather thanface large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered agreat deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quitejustified in making military training a good thing.  Remember,this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these peoplehad nobody to turn to save themselves.Just a little context to put this all in perspective.>So what did the Mormons get?

LDS and RLDSphilosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the trueChurch as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on hisown merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS mayas well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  Youcan only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejectedit.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans toBuddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong theywill not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hooverliked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbadealcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like.These people are the "salt of the Earth" and as such are moreeasily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.That's my somewhat educated guess, anyway.

So long as it accurately predicts or describes things we can observe.Not to be a pain in the ass, but is there any reason you don'tjust say _the theory of evolution_ rather than the _fact of evolutionis still a theory_.  I'm asking because this whole thread got startedbecause I was bothered by a post that referred to _the fact of evolution_,basically leaving off the phrase _is still a theory_.  Without a clarification, like the one you just gave, just saying _the fact ofevolution_ has a very different meaning to me.>>[description of atomic theory, and alternative theories of gravity, deleted]>>Both are very useful models that >>have no religious overtones or requirements of faith, unless of course you >>want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly >>the way the theory now formulated talks about it.>>Here is where you fail to make an important distinction.

Again, it may be because I feel strongerabout separating terms.  I was trying to say that the _theories_proposed to explain the _mechanisms_ and the _mechanisms_ themselvesare the only realities here.  It is the existence of mechanisms, not the things themselves, that are so predictive as to be considered fact (as you would say).  There aren't really little planetary particle systems called atoms out there.  Or I should say, and more to my original point, it would be a leap of faith to say there are, because we observe only the mechanisms.  There is no need to _believe_ there are _actually_atoms out there as we have decided to think about them.  It's enoughto discuss the mechanisms.  At any rate, I'm not sure I am being any clearer than before, but I thought it was worth a shot.The bottom line, though, is I think we agree on two fundamental ideas:   1. --evolution is a theory supported by observational evidence (my way)      --the fact of evolution is a theory supported by observational        evidence (your way)   2. --creation is just an opinion.  If a theist wants to call it        a theory then he can.  I won't:  it has no supporting evidence and it neither predicts nor supports any observations that can        be made.  With no mechanisms to talk about, there really isn'tmuch to say.Do you agree?--  jim halat         halat@bear.com     bear-stearns       --whatever doesn't kill you will only serve to annoy you--   nyc             i speak only for myself

But was it not until later that Christ rose from the dead     and ascended to heaven? If Christ Himself was not in heaven until     Sunday, how could the repentant thief have been there with Him? The     answer lies in the location of "paradise" when Jesus died.     Apparently paradise was not exalted to heaven until Easter Day.     Jesus refers to it in the middle of the story of the rich man and      Lazarus as "Abraham's Bosom," to which the godly beggar Lazarus was     carried by the angels after his decease (Luke 16:19-31).  Thus     "Abraham's Bosom" referred to the place where the souls of the redeemed     waited till the day of Christ's Resurrection.     It was not yet lifted to heaven but it may well have been a section of      hades (Hebrew: Sheol), reserved for believers who had died in the faith     but would not be admitted into the glorious presence of God in heaven     until the price of redemption had actually been paid on Calvary; or     even that none would precede the presence of Jesus back to glory with     the Father.     Doubtless it was the infernal paradise that the souls of Jesus and the     repentant thief repaired after they each died on Friday afternoon. But     on Sunday, after the risen Christ had first appeared to Mary Magdalene     (John 20:17) and her two companions (Matthew 28:9), presumably He then     took up with Him to glory all the inhabitants of infernal paradise     (including Abraham, Lazarus, and the repentant thief). We read in     Ephesians 4:8 concerning Christ: "Ascending on high, He led captivity     captive; He gave gifts unto men." Verse 9 continues: "But what does `He     ascended' mean but that He also descended to the lowest parts of the     earth?" -i.e., to hades. Verse 10 adds: "He who descended is the same     as He who ascended above all the heavens." Presumably He led the whole     band of liberated captives from hades (i.e., the whole population of     preresurrection paradise) up to the glory of heaven.ra> Whenever your personal interpretation of Biblical passages isra> challenged, your only response seems to be that one needs merely tora> "look at the Bible" in order to see the truth, but what of those whora> see Biblical things differently from you?     I think that this characterization is faulty. Whenever my 'personal      interpretation' is questioned, I usually give a reason.

I seem to be seeing from you the notion that any difference in how one      views the Bible is somehow legitimate, except, or course, for the stuff      that I glean from it. Put forward a contrary view and perhaps we can      have a discussion on that topic. But to decry something that I put      forward, without putting forward something else to discuss, and to      dismiss what I put forward while giving credence to other alleged views     that have yet to be put forward is simply being contentious.ra> Are we to simply assume that you are the only one who reallyra> understands it?

Whether one> sees the light or does not seen the light has nothing to do with > whether we do evil things.  We do them regardless.  Kent Sandvik responds:> Hmm, it seems that this is the core of Christianity then, you > have to feel guilty . . . I think I see where you are coming from Kent.  Jesus doesn't viewguilt like our modern venacular colors it.   "Feelings" have nothing to do with guilt.  Feelings arise from the state of being guilty.  Feeling and guilt are mutally exclusive.  Feelings are a reaction from guilt.  Jesus is talking about the guilt state, not the reaction.   Let me give you an example:Have you ever made a mistake?  Have you ever lied to someone?  Even alittle white lie?   Have you ever claimed to know something that you really didn't know?  Have you ever hated someone?  Have you ever been selfish?Are you guilty of any one of these?   The answer is of course, YES.  Youare guilty.  Period.  That is it what Jesus is getting at.  No big surprise.  Feelings do not even enter the picture.   Consider Jesus's use of the word"guilt" as how a court uses it.Jesus is concerned that everyone should admit that they are guilty of beingimperfect.  The Bible calls it the state that we are all sinners.  We all dobad things.  Even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong is proof of our guilt that we are all sinners.     It is it in our nature to do bad things. We are sinners, therefore we do bad things.  Being a sinner is fact.  It isnot a pleasant fact.  But it is just a fact.  We are not perfect.   Calling ussinners should have no more emotional charge to you than calling you ahuman being.  Guilty as charged.> and then there's this single personality that will save you from this> universal guilt feeling.You can handle your guilt in one of two ways:  Acknowledge youmade a mistake, learn from it, and try to not do it again--inthe meantime, not punishing yourself for it:  which is theway Jesus wants you to handle or it.  This is the healthy way.Or two, the destructive way:  put yourself down, slap yourselfand feel like crap, never forgive yourself, force yourself tosay a thousand Hail Marys . . . even to suicide.  This the way Jesus does NOT want us to deal with it.   All people fall into this category to some extent in their lives.Jesus is not in the business of saving us from this guiltfeeling.  Jesus is in the business of showing us how much heloves us despite our guilt.  Jesus knows we are guilty.  Thatisn't new to him.  It is no big deal to him. He just wants you to realize that this sinful nature destroys the relationship between you and him.That is what he wants you to know.  Why, because he wants to have your company.  You are immensely valuable to him.Jesus wants a relationship with you, however, in our presentsinful nature, we are incapable of having this relationship.  God is perfect.  We are not.  You cannot fit a square peg intoa round hole.  However, God has provided a way for us tochange our nature so that we can have a relationship with him.God has provided Jesus, so that whosoever just believes inJesus, will have their nature changed.  The Holy Spirit willmove it.  And now divine nature is now within lives our verybeing--and us and God communicate with each through hisunifying Holy Spirit.  The benefits of this are endless.  Forwith the divine nature living within us, we can now seeour imperfections better.  We can now head them off at the pass.  Withthe power of the Holy Spirit living in us, we now have his powerto help us overcome our shortcomings.   Because the divine nature lives within us, we can now understand profound Bible passages that never beforewe could understand.  Because the divine nature now lives within us, we now have authority over demonic forces.  And lastly, because the divine nature now lives within us, we have eternal life--for the Holy Spiritis eternal.The relationship with Jesus is of the utmost importance.  Becauseit is not what you do in life that qualifies you to belong toheavenly kingdom, it is your relationship to the living God.Remember what Jesus said at the tail end of Matthew when heseparated the "goats from the sheep".   Many people in thelast day will ask him, "Didn't I prophesy in your name and domiracles, and do good things in your name?"   And what did Jesus say?"Depart from me, for I never *knew* you."  That is the cornerstone of Christianity, Kent.  Jesus must know you as his friend.  It is your relationship to Jesus.  If he is your friend and you are his, you willbe counted among those who will share in his inheritance in heaven.  > Brian, I will tell you a secret, I don't feel guilty at all,> I do mistakes, and I regret them, however I've never had this> huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder.Good.  It shows that you have a strong self-image--that youlove yourself.  That is the second greatest commandment Jesustaught.  If only more people could do as you do.   As I said before, in the common english venacular, "feeling guilty" has adifferent meaning than the state of guilt.> This all is a very clear indication that you need a certain> personality type in order to believe and adjust to certain> religious doctrines.

The nice> thing is that when you finally shake off this huge burden,> the shoulders feel far more relaxed!Yes.  You have stated what Jesus said.  Remember?  "Come to me,take my yoke upon your shoulders, for my burden is light."  A yokeis used to direct oxen to do work.  Once you have a relationship with Jesus, you and him share the yoke and the burdens of life.  Having God at your side is of great advantage.

Being able to distinguish some egregious terrorist from some saintly man of peace does not mean that you have a method for tellingwho's a terrorist in general.Of course we *try* to tell them apart, but for my moneyit's better to try with the full awareness that we allbring bias to the judgement than to imagine that we areusing some objective test.jon.

In sum, Ezekiel prophesiedthat the place would be mashed and never rebuilt; as there are a lot ofpeople living there, it would appear that Ezekiel was not literally correct.This doesn't bother me at all, because I understand the language Ezekiel useddifferently than do so-called Biblical literalists.  For example, it sometimeshappens that someone says "My grandson is the cutest baby!" and then turnsaround and sees the granddaughter and says "Oh!  Isn't she the cutest thing!?"This person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in theworld according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied forfirst.  Rather, he is trying to express his emotions using words that are veryobject-oriented.  Because this example is one that is common to many people,nobody misunderstands the intent of the statements; the Bible, however, isoften at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactlyliterally true.  For those people, the existence of Tyre is a problem; for me,it is not.Turning to the latest person trying to defend Ezekiel, we read this fromJohn E King:> The prophesy clearly implies that people would still be living in the> area[.]No, it implies nothing of the kind.  If you had nothing but the prophecy fromEzekiel, and you were told you interpret it literally, you would never say"Oh, he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stufflike that."  You would read "I will make you a bare rock" and "You will neverbe rebuilt", and you'd conclude that Tyre would be a bare rock.  The only wayto get from `fishing nets' to `houses and buildings and a medium-largepopulation' is if you KNOW that all that latter stuff is there.In other words, your answer means that Ezekiel misled everybody who read theprophecy at the time it was written.  There is no way that, given a literalreading, they could read this passage and conclude "medium-size city".You seem to feel that "Never be rebuilt" means "be rebuilt" -- maybe so, butit is hardly a `clear implication'.Mr King also writes:> So far I've seen stated figurers ranging from 15,000 to 22,000.> Let's assume the latter one is correct.  By modern standards> we are talking about a one-horse town.Well, no.  That's only a bit less than the population of Annapolis, where I'mfrom.  You know, the Naval Acadamy, the state capital, George Washingtonresigned his commission in the statehouse?  Annapolis may not be New York, butit's at least a two-horse town.But supposing 22,000 people is a "small town" -- it's still 22,000 peopleMORE than Ezekiel predicted.And you've said nothing about the other problem.  In chapter 26, Ezekielpredicts that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all theirvaluables.  However, Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre, and in chapter 29Ezekiel even quotes God as saying "he and his army got no reward from thecampaign he led against Tyre."Let's ignore Alexander for a moment, and just pay attention to chapter 26.Ezekiel says N. would destroy Tyre, and N. did NOT destroy Tyre.  Ezekiel saysthat N. would plunder their valuables, but N. did NOT plunder their valuables.Regardless of what you think about Tyre _now_, the fact is that N. died beforethe place was destroyed.  Ezekiel said N. was going to do it, and N. did not. *This post is, of course, pointless.  Inerrantists have an amazing abilityto rewrite the Bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say.For example, I expect Mr King to respond to the comments about Ezekiel 26by pulling some "clear implications" out of hat.When Ezekiel said that N. would "demolish your towers", that clearly impliedthat the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towersused to be.  And when Ezekiel said that N. would "demolish your fine housesand throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea", that clearly impliedthat N. would never set foot on the island.  And when Ezekiel wrote that N.would "build a ramp up to your walls", that clearly implies that N. wouldspend 13 years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to thewalls.See?  A few "clear implications" that are totally contrary to the text, andyou can reconcile anything you want.Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu"[Do] You know why I'm the enabler?

Accuracy is a value judgement, too.  It so happens I agree with the substance of what you say below, but it's clear to me that at least *some* values are objective.  Truth is better than falsehood, peace isbetter than war, education is better than ignorance.  We know these things,if we know anything.#Assuming, for the moment, that morals _are_ relative, then two#relativists can recognize that neither has a lock on the absolute#truth and they can proceed to negotiate a workable compromise that#produces the desired results.No they cannot, because they acknowledge up front that THE desiredresults do not exist.  That, after all, is the meaning of compromise.Plus some problems: If the relativists have no values in common, compromise is impossible - what happens then?    Who, if anyone, is right?  What happens if one relativist has a value "Never compromise?".  A value "plant bombs in crowded shopping areas"?  After all, if morals are relative, these values cannot *meaningfully* be said to be incorrect.#Assuming that there is an absolute morality, two disagreeing #objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right; there#is no room for compromise.  Once you beleive in absolute morals,#you must accept that you are amoral or that everyone who disagrees#with you is amoral.Untrue.  One can accept that one does not know the whole truth.

But it's bloody to pointless to speak of it if it'smerely a matter of taste.  Is your liking for peace any better foundedthan someone else's liking for ice-cream?

Ihave seen the film called "The Gay Agenda" and along with my church we foundit to be horrifying.  Not because of what was actually shown (cleaver use ofeditting can create any image one wants to portray), rather becaseu we are familiafamiliar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive peopleare actually believing the garbage found within it.  The truth is that neitheryou nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay, but knowing asmany as I do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and lifeI have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report, somethingobviously claimed against gays as well.  The truth is that unless YOU areinnately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing.  I speak as anabolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society.  I do notsupport wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by ChristianFundamentalist extremists, but I know people who are not the sexual deviantsyour report paints them to be.  It is no mistake that the APA removedhomosexuality from it's list of mental illnesses, it is also no mistake thatthere are many Christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list.I do not feel threatened by gays, I don't understand why others are.The following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min-istries:  Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous.THE FOUNDER OF AN "EX-GAY" SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETEROby Robert Pela (from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE)In December 1985, David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate's homophobia rewaaawards: the A Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation.  As director of FREEINDEED, a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri was singled out for offeringdiscontented gays and lesbians "a way out of the homosexual death-style"through prayer.  "I'd like to give the award back," Caligiuri now laughs, "I'mno longer deserve it."  Caligiuri's eight year involvement with the national "ex-gay" movement peakedwith his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as wellas Free Indeed.  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex-gay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.  "There's no realityin it," he says, "I was selling a product, and my product was a lie."  Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage, theorganizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-againChristianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men whoare just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing theirsexual urges and embracing Christianity.  "We offer support to people who areseeking to leave the sin of homosexuality," explains Bob Davies, director ofExodus.  He ventures that "about 80% of those seeking to abandon their homo-sexuality are men."  "Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wastingtheir time," says Lisa Seeley, a former "redeemed lesbian" who worked withCaligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  "Theseorganizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded."  "It's possible to change your identity or your behavior," says sex educatorBrian McNaught, author of _On Being Gay_. "But it's really impossible tochange your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay,but they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings."  Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when allhell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended boththeir romance and their business partnership, Caligiuri was sexually assaultedby a man he picked up in a bar.  "I was really drunk," he recalls, "and Iwent home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up allnight, and the next morning he raped me again."  When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to thehome he shared with his ex-lover.  "He had another man there with him,"Caligiuri recalls.  "I thought at this time, 'If this is what being gay isabout, I don't want to be this way anymore."  Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discoverywith others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix'sgay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held itsfirst public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance,Free Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headedfor hell.  Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanksin part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  "We were listedunder Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services," Caligiuri says, "so peoplethought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find outwhere the local bars were, and we'd preach to them about the sins of homo-sexuality."  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says,adding, "They'll do anything to reach these people."  "David used to go on radio and say really stupid things," recalls PeterKelly, a counselor at Phoenix's Catholic diocese AIDS program, "like thathe knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors."  Caligiuri's family first found out about his ministry when they saw him onRaphael's syndicated talk show in 1985.  "They were relieved," he recalls."They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, betterthat I should be a 'reformed' gay person."  But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  "By the time I appeared on Sally'sshow," "I'd started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotlineand tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with theirfather.  I was horny all the time."  Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from hisnumerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he "used to go to bookstoresand get blowjobs."  When he wasn't working the bookstores, he was sleepingwith other "reformed" homosexuals.  "I didn't realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sexwith one another," Caligiuri says.  "We'd go to conferences in other cities,and we'd be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybodyelse."  By the time he appeared on 'AM Philadelphia' television show in May 1988,Caligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show'shost asked him if he ever "acted on temptation," his answer was a lie.  Caligiuri's duplicity began to take it's toll on him, however.  He wassuffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitatingyeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  "I was too sickto go to church," he explains.  "The more time I spent away from those peoplethe more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be."  Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a localchurch and closed the ministry's doors.  "I'd convinced myself that thereis no need in the world for ex-gay people," he says.  Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities ("I'm interest-ed in belief systems that aren't judgemental."), considering romance ("Butnot with a CHristian!"), and searching for a new project to devote himself to."I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes," he says.  "I want toeventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage Imay have brought to our community."---end article---Caligiuri's tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articlesof former leaders and founders of 'ex-gay' ministries who have said very similar thsimilar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but havecome to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some,like Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian "Lazarus Project" of WestHollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay communityto bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical valuesof sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and becomeand become close friends with many who once attended such groups as "Love InAction" and others, who either once claimed to have been "reformed" or whowere too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointedin them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of "sealing" theirnew heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhousesand bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment ofnight and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous "sin"through a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurchhas dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno-cent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yetthe church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allowgay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is alsomrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires andfear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces onthem, they may even opt for 'suicide' or surgical dampering of the brainfunctions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common-place.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on thethreat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington's_"Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many factbased books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such asMaury Johnston's _Gays Under Grace_, and Chris Glaser's _Come Hom!_.  Iseriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution andself-acceptance.Thank you.

It'sobvious from even a cursory study of history that no system,regardless of the authority it may claim for its basis, will makepeople act any better. Until human nature changes, the products of ournature won't change, and that has to include society. I think yourassessment of human potential in this regard is too optimistic.   What is needed is an absolute moral standard if -all- people are tocreate any Utopias. By implying a Utopian future, you also argue foran absolute standard that applies to everyone in every case.

The appearance that there is onecomes from attempting to use a coordinate system that doesn't map properly(physically) in this geometry, rather analogous to the "singularity" atthe North and South Poles of the Earth when using Latitude and Longitudelines.  Such "singular" behavior as the earlier post suggested (infinitetime to reach the horizon) is a mathematical artifact of the wrong choiceof coordinates.  As Paul says, in the object's frame of reference,it WILL hit the horizon in finite time, and then plunge to the singularity(that IS a "real" singularity) in a (short, for "small" holes) further finite amount of time.Not only that, but to an OUTSIDE observer, an object that falls into a blackhole disappears in a finite time also, in spite of the relativistic "slow-down" that intuition suggests.  This is because any light emitted by theobject as it falls (or is shone onto it by a separate "flashlight") consistsof individual, FINITE quanta, and only a finite number of these can reachthe object before it plunges through the horizon.  These will be succesivelymore red-shifted, true, but only a finite number of them will hit the object,and following ones will be too late to interact with the object until they,too, are inside the horizon (and thus cannot come out).This reddening, dimming and disappearance is exponentially fast, as the object approaches the horizon, when you do the math.As Paul says, this is discussed in Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler's book "Gravity" where they talk about the appropriatness (sp?) of the term "black hole" and the inappropriatness (sp?) of an older term: "frozen star", which was used earlier in this century before all the implications of black-hole theory were understood.

So, here are some references.  See Robin Lane Fox's _The unauthorized version_, (p.284) where Lane Fox writes, "... the one passage which appears to [comment on Jesus' career] is agreed to be a Christian addition."In my Re:Albert Sabin response (C5u7sJ.391@sunfish.usd.edu) to Jim Lippard (21April 93), I noted that consensus is typically indicated subtly as in Elaine Pagel's _The gnostic gospels_ (p.85), to wit:  "A comment *attributed* toJosephus reports ... [emphasis mine]".  Scholars sometimes do not even mentionthe two Josephus entries, another subtlety reflecting consensus.So far as I can deduce, today's consensus is built on at least three things: 1) the long passage is way out of context, 2) Origen did not know about thelong passage, and 3) the short and long passages are contradictory. I don't know the references wherein the arguments which led to consensus areorginally developed (does anyone?).Biblical scholars as I defined them include theologians and historians.  Theformer, like the latter, incorporate historical, social, technological andideological contexts as well as theology.  So the distinction is blurred.  I didn't elaborate on that.  Sorry.  (In turn, historians are compelled toincorporate theology).Can't say about the number of copies.  These were, however, BG times (Before Gutenburg).  A hundred first editions seems exceedingly high; counting on one hand seems more reasonable.  Perhaps those mss. without the long insert (if any,because anything is possible) have been destroyed.  Such a practice is certainly not foreign to religions.  Anyway, all we have are mss. which have the two entries.  Lippart (in the message noted above) talks about an Arabic ms.  But here the ms. date is critical.:-)Rich Fox, Anthro, Usouthdakota

It seems very appropriate that this is cross-posted toalt.conspiracy.Assuming the most favorable interpretation of your '1000 degree'measurement (that the temperature is in Centigrade, rather than themore common -in the US- Fahrenheit), you are still laboring under atleast 2 misconceptions:1.  You seem to believe that steel melts somewhere around 1000 C.    Actually, the melting point of most iron alloys (and steels are    iron alloys) is in the neighborhood of 1400 C.  Even if the gun    were found in area which achieved the 1000 C temperature, the steel    parts of the gun would not be deformed, and it would still be    trivial to identify the nature of the weapon.2.  A fire is not an isothermal process.  There are 'hot' spots and    'cold' spots, though 'cold' is purely a relative term.   So the    weapon was not necessarily situated in a hot spot, as you seem to    imply.  And, even if it was, so what?  It would not have melted    anyway.darinwilkins@scubed.com________________________________|                              || I will be President for food ||______________________________|

The survivors claim it was not a suecide.    BD's were not contemplating suecide, and there is no reason     to believe they committed one.-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Disclaimer: Opinions expressed are mine, not my employer's.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In many types ofexperiments the "prediction" is that the observed phenomena will happen againand be capable of being observed. For example, in chemistry someone may predict: the outcome of a chemical reaction and then actually observe that reactionrepeatedly. You can't repeat or ever know for sure the original conditions that produced life. So it seems we could never say, "That's exactly how it happened."As far as we know that event was unobserved. (At least no one has admitted: it. :-) ) So unlike the chemistry experiment repeatability and observability,: strictly speaking, are lacking.: -- Can't resist, because I've thought about it...Basically what is being constructed is a theory of abiogenesis.There are any number of criterion that would have to be satisfied forthe theory to be accurate, such as the hotly discussed topic ofstereoisomerism.  Just making life in the lab wouldn't suffice (forall the wonder that would engender!), because for the theory ofabiogenesis to be accurate, the life would have to resemble the bestidea we have of what the earliest lifeforms resembled.Comes down to that old question "Can we ever really be sure?"But if were to examine a claim that abiogenesis had beendemonstrated in the laboratory AND was the most likely path followed onprimordial Earth, I would look for the following:1)  Experiment reproduced a plausible primordial Earthenvironment;2)  ALL contamination sources were eliminated;3)  The lifeform produced resembles primitive/simple Earthlifeforms;4)  The theory accounts for differences in the modernEarth environment and primitive Earth environment.NOW, if those criteria were satisfied, Dr. Abio, who performed theexperiment, would then be in possession of the best candidate fora theory of abiogenesis on the primordial Earth.  At which point Dr.BBio could then counter with a decisive critique keyed on an aspectof the theory which doesn't match the early Earth environment, ora characteristic of the new "lifeform" that doesn't resemble lifeon Earth.  Were he to suggest an improvement to eliminate thediscrepancies, and perform an experiment to demonstrate his claims,Dr. BBio would then have the best theory.Never provable;  constantly modifiable;  progressing evercloser to the "correct" answer, until the evidence is overwhelming(and even when it is, a theory that explains even MORE may take itsplace) ------- that's a scientific theory.===========================================================|  James G.

These Greek words have totally different meanings.  The words are Hades, Tartaros, and Gehenna.    In bibical usage, the Greek word Hades is used only 11 times in the New Testament, and is roughly the equivalent to the Old Testament word Sheol...meaning the grave or pit (compare Acts 2:27 with Psalms 16:10).  Hades may be likened to a hole in the ground. (In the Bible it has nothing to do with fire!)    Most modern bibical translators admit that the use in the English word hellto translate Hades and Sheol are an unfortunate and misleading practice.      Why?  Because when seeing the word "hell" many readers impute to it the traditional connotation of an ever-burning inferno, when this was never remotely intended in the Greek language or in Old English!    In its true bibical usage Hades does indeed refer to the state or abode of the dead, but not in the sense of spirits walking around in some sort of "shadowy realm."  Hades is simply the abode we call the grave.  All dead go to this hell.    The second "hell" of the Bible, Tartaros, is mentioned only once in scripture, 2 Pet.2:4; "For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell (TARTAROS), and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment..."    Following their rebellion to unseat God from His throne (Isa.14:12-14; Rev.12:4), the archangel Lucifer (now Satan) and a third of the created angels (now demons) were ejected from heaven (Luke 10:18).  They were cast down to Tartaros, a place or condition of restraint that God has imposed on the mutinous angels as they await ultimate judgment (Jude 6; 1 Cor.6:3).    Tartaros, then, is a "hell" that applies only to evil, rebellious angels ordemons (It is interesting that the ancient Greeks used this word to describe the place in which Zeus confined the rebellious Titans).  Nowhere in the Bible is there any mention of men being put into this particular "hell".    The the third word that is translated as "hell" in the Bible is Gehenna. Itcomes from the Hebrew GAI HINNOM, meaning "valley of Hinniom."  Hinnom is a deep, narrow ravine located to the south and southwest of Jerusalem.    In Old Testament times it was a place of abominable pagan rites, including infant sacrifice (It was there that the apostate kings Ahaz and Manasseh made their children "pass through the fire" to the god Molech.  The rites were specifically celebrated in Tophet, the "place of abhorrence," one of the chief groves in the valley).    King Josiah of ancient Judah finally put an end to these abominations.  He defiled the valley, rendering it ceremonially unclean (2 Kings 23:10).  Later the valley became the cesspool and city dump of Jerusalem; a repository for sewage, refuse and animal carcasses.  The bodies of dispised criminals were also burned there along with the rubbish.  Fires burned continuously, feeding by a constant supply of garbage and refuse.    Aceldama, the "field of blood", purchased with the money Judas received forthe betrayal of Christ (Matt.27:8) was also in part of the valley of Hinnom.    So what does this valley called Gehenna have to do with hell?      In Rev.19:20: the Satan inspired political dictator and a miracle-working religious figure, the False Prophet, working with him will resist the re-establishment of the government of God by Jesus Christ at His Second Coming.Their fate is revealed by the apostle John: "And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet...  These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone."        Where will this temporary lake of fire (this "hell") be?    The prophet Isaiah wrote of this lake of fire prepared for the Beast: "For Tophet (in the valley of Hinnom) is ordained of old, yea for the king it is prepared, he hath made it deep and large, the pile thereof is fire and wood, the breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it" (Isa.30:33).    One thousand years later, Satan himself will be cast into this rekindled fiery lake where the Beast and False Prophet were cast! (Rev.20:10).    But what of the wicked who have died over the millennia?  Does the Bible say that they are now suffering fiery punishment for their sins in a lake of fire?    In the sequence of Rev.20 the incorrigibly wicked are resurrected to be thrown into the lake of fire after Satan is cast there! (Rev.20:15). What will become of these wicked?  Will they writhe in flames for eternity?      The wicked will be burned up from the intense heat of the coming Gehenna fire on the earth.  They wil be consumed, annihilated, destroyed!  This punishment will be everlasting (permanent and final).  The Bible calls it the "second death" (Rev.20:14; 21:8), from which there is no possibility of a further resurrection.    The Bible does teach eternal punishment, but not eternal punishing.                               The prophet Malachi provides a graphic description. "For, behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up..."(4:1).  To the righteous, God says that the wicked shall be "ashes under the soles of your feet..."(Mal.4:3).    Gehenna was a place of destruction and death, not a place of living torture!  Jesus was talking to Jews who understood all about this Gehenna or valley of Hinnom.  Utter destruction by fire was complete.  Nothing was left, but ashes!     Every text in the Bible translated from this Greek word Gehenna means complete destruction, not living torture (not eternal life in torment)!  The Bible says, in Romans 6:23, "The wages of sin is death", not eternal life in torture.  The punishment revealed in the Bible is Death... the cessation of life.         Eternal life is the GIFT OF GOD!

Can you show me anything that would lead you to think >> otherwise?>See the "Spreading Christianity" thread, in which he says I>ignore certain statements that I specifically acknowledged andDean did not.  He called them "the Great Commission" but this is NOTdescriptive of Jesus's words in Matt. 10:15.Matt. 10:14, Jerusalem Bible translation:"And if anyone does not welcome you or listen to what you haveto say, as you walk out of the house or town shake the dustfrom your feet."Matt. 10:15: "I tell you solemnly, on the day of Judgment it will not  go as hard with the land of Sodom and Gomorrah as with  that town."In the post to which Dean is referring above, I said:"> The above is a good description of Kaflowitz, who keeps harping on > shaking the dust off the feet but ignoring what Christ said next."   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                                ^^^^The highlighted words refer to Matt 10:14 and 10:15 respectively.And Dean countered:"Actually, this comment of your's is a perfect example of what anintellectually dishonest little sparrowfart you are, since Ispecifically acknowledged the Great Commission and the entreatyto spread the word.  In fact, it is the combination of the twostatements I was addressing, and not just the one, and for you tocharacterize that as "ignoring" the instruction to spread theword is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you are."Of course, Matt 10:15 [quoted above] makes no mention of "instructionto spread the word."All these quotes btw are from:Message-ID: <1993Apr13.121624.3400@cbnewsj.cb.att.com>>in which, at the end, he claims I did not answer a question>which I answered, and which he deleted (to get the chronology>right, he deleted the answer and then said I didn't answer).And I claim it correctly, because my question went:"Do you, too, measurethe goodness of a post by its entertainment value, and care nota whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood?"and the closest Dean came to an answer was:"Peter, Peter, Peter.  You're just so stupid, pretentious, dull,and generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself thatthe sport is all there is."Of course, this does NOT answer my question, which has to do with postsin GENERAL and not my posts in particular.  Surely even Dean knows this,yet he brazenly asserts otherwise, reinforcing his claim with an insult:"So I now restore the answer to your questionthat you deleted.  If you're still unable to figure it out, aska nice kid at the local junior high to help you.  It reallydoesn't take much sophistication to understand."On top of which, I doubt that the "answer" is at all representativeof Dean's true frame of mind.  The insults you have seen quoted thusfar are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of Dean's mind throughout the 284-line post from which these quotes were taken.One wonders whether Dean's mind is so warped as to find sport in allthis.He even dredges up a falsified account ofevents that transpired earlier on another thread:"You made an ass of yourself by claiming that it^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^was in the tradition of Lent to make public announcements of^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^the "sins" of other individuals."^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^False.  I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one's sins.That I made public announcements of the "sins" of others--"sins", BTW, that were a matter of public record, documented inthe posts of others-- is a different matter.Many of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral thatthey do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins, soI pointed some of them out.  And I expressly set up a whole thread,YOUR TURN, to let people point out MY sins to me.Dean again:"You made an ass of yourselfby saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah wassomehow an attempt to "paint Jews as plaster saints," therebyrevealing your inability to understand the discussion as wellas showing your dislike for people saying positive thingsabout Jews, and now you show your intellectual dishonesty byrepeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made, and thenclaiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge."Actually, what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jewwho gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocriteaccording to Jewish customs.  In doing so, he was caricaturingJewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding, as well asimplicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity.I went very easily on Dean for this, giving him the benefit ofthe doubt in a post following my initial crack about "plaster saints", suggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording.In an astonishing act of ingratitude, Dean now serves up an incrediblydistorted picture of what took place between us, and using it asthe basis of one insult after another.Peter Nyikos

You have to ask the insurer: "Would my policycover an abortion?" to find out.  If it does, you should have aright to decline that "coverage" if YOU DON'T WANT IT.The basic premise in private insurance is that you pay for thecoverage YOU WANT.  If basically you want "catastrophic coverage"you get a policy with a high deductible (with a correspondinglyLOWER premium).  Similarly, you don't have to be COMPELLED totake on a policy covering things like liposuction or hairtransplantation, if you DON'T WANT THAT KIND OF COVERAGE, again,at a corresponding savings to you.If you don't want to be "covered" for abortion, you should not beCOMPELLED to.  To millions of Christians, abortion is not a"gynocological examination" or a "pap smear."  To them abortionis murder.  To them, being "covered for abortion" means that theyare paying for a "service," which THEY THINK IS EVIL, CLEARLYDON'T WANT, and will NEVER USE.  In such a case, all that ishappening is that they are being COMPELLED to help pay for OTHERPEOPLE'S abortions.When you are being forced to BUY something you DON'T WANT andwill NEVER USE, this is called extortion.When the mafia tells a restaurant owner to "buy" a "juke-box" forthe owner's "protection" this is called racketeering. And if one's access to health care is held hostage to signing adefacto "loyalty oath" in support of abortion, by promising tohelp pay for other people's abortions (when one is clearlyopposed to this procedure) this is tantamount to the same thing.dennisdzkriz@ocf.berkeley.edu

Can he be impartial     when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or     will he assume the superstition of his parents     when questioning? I've often found it to be the case that the theist     will stick to some kind of superstition when     wondering about God and his scriptures.  I've     seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,     and the other theists alike.  All assume that     their mothers and fathers were right in the     aspect that a god exists, and with that belief     search for their god.     Occasionally, the theist may switch religions or     aspects of the same religion, but overall the     majority keep to the belief that some "Creator"     was behind the universe's existence.  I've     known Muslims who were once Christians and vice     versa, I've known Christians who were once     Jewish and vice versa, and I've even known     Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout     their transition from one faith to another,     they've kept this belief in some form of higher     "being."  Why?     It usually all has to do with how the child is     brought up.  From the time he is born, the     theist is brought up with the notion of the     "truth" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,     the Torah, the Qur'an, & etc.  He is told     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.     He is also told that to question this (as     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-     ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell.     Thus, by the time he is able to read the     scripture for himself, the belief in its "truth"     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a     matter of course.     But it doesn't stop there.  Once the child is able     to read for himself, there is an endeavor to     inculcate the child the "right" readings of     scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant     readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to     explain away the unexplainable with "mystery."     Circular arguments, "self-evdent" facts and     "truths," unreasoning belief, and fear of     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat     of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath     of some sort, and the child must learn to put     away his brain when the matter concerns God.     All of this has some considerable effect on the     child, so that when he becomes an adult, the      superstitions he's been taught are nearly     impossible to remove.     All of this leads me to ask whether the theist can     truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,     Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.     Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that     God *does* exist and look at everything from     a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most     theists can somewhat, especially when presented     with "mythical gods" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,     & etc.).  But can they put aside the assumption     of God's existence and question it impartially?

Or are the allegations just part of the Big> Cover-Up?Thank you, Steve.  It is refreshing to have someone accuse me of beinga Christian.  I only hope enough evidence can be garnered to get aconviction.  I am not certain what you mean by the "fundy" part as theterm fundamentalist has a wide variety of uses.  If you refer tothose who actually believe Jesus is the Messiah and Son of God andwish to follow in his way, then I plead guilty.  But what does itmatter what I think.  The Roman circus is over.  The lions have beensatisfied -- for now.  The Emperor, after the long and gruellingstruggle, sensed the crowd was tiring and gave thumbs down.With respect to my previous comments about David Koresh, I urge youto re-examine my previous posts.  I believe you mistakenly assumethat defense of Koresh' right to his own personal beliefs and hisright to express them to others implies agreement with Koresh'theology.  Actually I understand little about the details of Branch-Davidian teachings and regret so many are hung-up on that aspectof the tragic events of the past few days.Nor do I think Koresh' sex life should be of any interest to thefederal government.  Of course Hillary says he had been molestinginfants so it must be true even though such allegations do notfall under the jurisdiction of the federal government; they arestate and local matters and have been thoroughly reviewed at thelocal level by proper authorities with no successful charge havingever been levied against him.  Under American law, he was innocentas Americans are presumed innocent until proven guilty.  At leastthat's how it is suppposed to be.  But he was demonized and propa-gandized against by a powerful machine to have him appear as alustful beast and therefore deserving of every ill the fates mightbring upon him.  But evidence trickles in that the twenty-one children, who left thebuilding in the early days of the siege,  were carefully examinedby qualified authorities for evidence of physical or sexual abuseand none was found.  DeGuerin, one of the attorneys who met withDavidians several times before the conflagration, reported thatthe children seemed well adjusted and showed no sign of abuse.Ultimately, Steve, what I think about the heart of David Koreshis quite unimportant.  Today he is in the benevolent hands of amost wise and merciful judge who will one day surely judge us all.So I withhold any judgment of David Koresh and defer to the Onewho has all knowledge.  Meanwhile, let's clean up the mess lefton earth and keep this from happening again by sending a strongmessage to the government to respect the inalienable rights of thepeople it serves.--Joe Gaut> > (I remain deliberately neutral on the cause of the fire: I wouldn't> put it past Koresh to have torched the place himself.

The lukewarm stew he detects may well be an inevitable result of the divine mixing himself up with a bunch of losers such as humanity. Also unfortunately (perhaps) I have a deadline in two weeks, the responsibility for which prevents me, in good conscience, from writing a more considered response and fully entering thefray, as it were. Let me then say what I can, briefly.----->The two commandments *are* rules; they are merely rules that are>so vague that they are practically devoid of meaning.  This point, for the net.browsers who also still read books, ispursued throughly in Kaufmann, Critique_of_Religion_and_Philosophy.>The commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed,>in part, as reminding man that he is not God and cannot act as if>he has "ultimate responsibility." This is a theological statement worthy of Barth.Dr Turpin (DD) may wear the black robe of Geneva yet! :-)>Indeed, many traditions present>an interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret>loving one's neighbor as following various other rules, and>relying on their god to make things come out right, precisely>because it would be wrong for man to assume such "ultimate>responsibility." Once again, we are confronted with good sounding>goo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean. This requires the assumption that all interpretations areequally valid, that there is no way of reasonably distinguishingamong them. I wouldn't make that assumption; I don't think it isa reasonable assumption. >And who is to say that this interpretation is "twisted"?  There>are many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward>reading show the Christian god behaving in just this way.Michael, and I, and others, read 'the Bible' with Christianglasses. Among the things that this should imply is that theNT informs the OT, even to the point of dominanting it. Somepoints in the OT (ceremonial & dietary laws) are explicitly abrogated by the NT texts. To drive Russell Turpin's point withadequacy, one needs to begin with NT texts (probably from Matthew,and probably about damnation) (Just trying to help :-) )This part is, I discover, what most moves me to post:mls> I am a "radical" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.>No, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel >seriously.  What differentiates you is the way you interpret the>gospel.Russell Turpin's 'No' here is misplaced, not to say inappropriate.Michael's self-description much govern.  The equation of radical = liberal, which seems implied by Russell Turpin  is wrong.  Radical conservatives are possible (if sadly lacking in numbers at present). Thomas Mertonwas a radical, even though conservative in some ways. St Franciswas a radical, similarly. How many examples are needed?mls> ... Why don't I and the (myriads of) other Christians like memls> tell you something about Christianity? ...Michael's question gets to a heart of the matter (Klingons havetwo hearts, so my metaphor is not mixed, just extraterrestrial :-) )Russell Turpin (in an earlier post) had said that Michael (Michael'stheological positions, actually) didn't tell him much about Christianity;Dean Simeon responds (this time gently): 'What do you mean?' Moredirect, perhaps, would have been: 'What could you possibly mean?'The implied rhetorical effort, to separate Michael from the tradition, is a failure. Michael is in the tradition. If your ideaof the tradition doesn't include him, Change your idea of the tradition!>The irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity per>se that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and>gays.  How can one answer this while staying on the more general issue?I'm on the other side of the interpretive fence (from Michael)on this issue, yet '*nothing*' is a hideous overstatement.One verse is enough to refute it; I'll offer two, fromPaul (of all people):'In Jesus Christ there is neither male nor female...'(Galatians 3:28{I don't quote single verses as a rule, and I don't carry them in my head}) and '*Nothing* shall separate us from the glory of God...' (roughly, from Romans). [If Russell would promise to convert basedon these or any other verses,  I'd promise to get the full contextfor any that he requires :-) :-)]>In short, it is the extra-Christian principles that>make Michael's Christianity beneficial, and I suspect they would>be as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered by>Christian interpretation.

In the Jewish tradition you are incrediblywrong!  They originate in the Torah and with Jewish ancestors,specifically the Patriarch Abraham (z"l).  That knowledge was sent Eastto India and China when Abraham gave "gifts" (the commentators to Jewishscripture say this was the knowledge of the occult arts) to all the restof his children when he sent them away to the East.  This assured thatIsaac only, who remained with Abraham, would inherit his most importantspiritual gifts, what eventually became Judaism.So you see, other religions can have very parochial views too.  By theJewish view, you are very mistaken, your scripture are not scripture,your gods are not gods, your practices a jumble of errors that leadpeople to idol worship and away from God.  That doesn't stop us fromrespecting you to the extent of not trying to convert you or proselytizeyou and being willing to dialog in a respectful manner.  We're contentto let you live the way you care to live as long as you leave us be.

In other words, he is just plain selfish. You are a most presumptuous fellow!  How dare you presume that the"typical" New Ager doesn't acknowledge God and is selfish.

I'm curious to know what purpose people think these lists serve.Lists like this seem to value quantity over quality, an "argumentfrom article length."  And the list you have here is of poorerquality than most.  Since the quotes seem to be taken from anon-line bible, I doubt that there will be much problem withverses quoted inaccurately.  But that isn't the problem here.I've known a lot of fundamentalists in my life, but none whodenied that there were errors in transmission, etc.  And many ofthe contradictions here -- Solomon having 40,000 horse stalls inone verse, and 4,000 in another -- are just the sort ofcontradiction that fundies don't have a problem with, in myexperience.  So how do these sorts of contradictions amount toanything more than attacking a straw man?Some of the others are just silly, or rely on taking quotes outof context, or have reasonable explanations.  But even the onesthat are genuine contradictions need to have more said aboutthem than what is given here.  (At the very least, some effortshould be made to understand and respond to the common repliesgiven by fundies.)  Look for example at the research that DaveButler put into an article examining a false prophecy about Tyre.That would be an excellent start for an anti-inerrancy list thatwould have some teeth.  (One well-researched and documentedcontradiction is worth more than one hundred quotes taken outof context and thrown together in a list.)Lists like this that just toss a bunch of quotes together tomake a bible verse salad just don't cut it.  Those of us whowant to argue against inerrancy should find this sort of thingas embarassing as the fundies should find Josh McDowell.djP.S. You can find some good material at ftp.rutgers.edu in/pub/soc.religion.christian/others/contradictions.  The qualityis very uneven on both sides of the argument (it is just acompilation of things many people have written), but some ofit would be useful in an anti-inerrancy FAQ.  After exams, Imight be willing to help put it together.

Do I read youcorrectly? And just what constitutes *strive*? Did Jesus say this anddefine just what "striving" means? Can you give an example of striving that is insufficient to qualify one as a Christian and thus condemns one to eternal damnation in fiery torture? Do you self-proclaim yourself aChristian and if so on what basis?

Seems that those who have been purified through salvation, or that thoseprotected by the Seals, will be the ones who survive.

First off, let me congratulate you for not posting a flame about "You sickperverts, you are immoral, you are all going to hell.", which seems to be theusual "religious" post found on the alt.sex.* hierarchy.  Hopefully, you won'tget flamed, either.You will, however, be argued with.  I personally think that your project isbuilt on unsteady ground.First, I do not believe that there is any way to find an "objective morality". Morality and value are inherently subjective - they represent the beliefs of aperson or a group of people.  They can be widely held, perhaps evenoverwhelmingly held, but they are never and _can_ never be objective.> Assumptions:> > (1) A Christian bedrock assumption that all that is True, comes> Truly from God. > > (2) Regarding alt.sex.stories.

If, as you say,you are trying to be objective, then why accept a morality to begin with byusing the Christian Bible?  You're defeating your own purpose by doing so. > In the long run, the advantage of making such a literary/moral> analysis is that it will save band-width between Christians and> non mutually flaming each other about the moral acceptability of> the stuff on these (pornographic) groups.Third, call me a pessimist, but you won't stop the flamage.  There will alwaysbe people who pop upin alt.sex.* to tell us how sick and twisted and evil weall are.  Just out of curiosity, do alt.sex readers show up unprovoked in thereligion groups to tell you all that you are narrow-minded, censoring,overbearing totalitarianists? > Basically, there should not be a dissonance between a "Christian"> morality and a "non-Christian" one.  Either there is value in a> particular work, or there is not whether one is a Christian or> not.Hm.  Let me provide an example.  Four people get together over dinner, todiscuss morality: you, me, a rather conservative Moslem, and a sociopath.  Istart off by saying that I think it's immoral to force people to have sex withyou.  You agree, but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone ofyour own gender.  (Just a note: I really don't know your views onhomosexuality, I am just using this as a common view of morality for thepurposes of this example.)  The Moslem says that it is immoral for women tohave their faces uncovered.The sociopath, who has become bored, kills all three of us and eats us, butfeels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own mind.                                                                          > In support for the first assumption:> > The Christian scriptures say this:(Evidence deleted)I'm not going to accept your evidence for this.  You ask us to accept "The Wordof God" that everything good comes from God.  This is only a valid argument fora person who shares your beliefs.Still, I must say that cataloging the major themes and motifs in erotica couldbe interesting for other reasons than yours, so good luck with this next part.>                                                                        >              **************************************> > NOW THEN what are some of the major themes/motifs in the> pornographic literature on places like alt.sex.stories?

In addition, if sex is for procreation, then1)Why did God make it pleasurable, so that people would want to do it,rather than building it in as instinct?2)Why did God make it fallible?

I have clearlyshown one of your shortcomings, if not two.  That is, ignorance of the Bibleand the arrogance you demonstrate butchering it without even knowing its contents.> I regard Christ as a myth. Because you have been too prideful to examine the record of him for yourself.And to demonstate your lack of support for your conclusion, I bet you do noteven know what the word "Christ" means.  Or which prophet used "Christ" to describe the "Son of Man". > I feel that there are far too many people> offering far too many interpretations of what he supposedly said and> did.  The only person who can really judge me is *me*.Yes.  I agree with that.  So we must learn first.  Read the Bible.  Comeup with our own interpretation.   Evaluate what is being saidand by whom.  Check the history books as well.  Compare someone else'sinterpretation with your own.  Then make a judgment.  But I tell you thetruth, 99% of what is being said in the Bible needs interpretation as much as a coffee cup needs interpretation.And remember, the Bible isn't a Guru's Esoteric Guide to Metaphysics.  It doesn't take a theologian to understand what is being said.    The Bible is a bunch of testimonies from people like you and I addressed to people like you and I.  These guys wrote down what they saw and heard.  Is it their open diary--and they want to tell you something.  And because theywant you to know something, they make it very clear what they want you toknow.   They didn't encouch their ideas in esoteric rhetoric, but in simplestraight-forward language.> I choose the> roads I travel, and I decide whether or not I want to reach the end of> any given road or turn back -- and as long as I don't *always* turn> back, there's no shame in it.  When I need help, I seek out my friends.You have chosen the road that avoids the Bible.  You have chosen theroad that avoids a confrontation with the living God because thatroad doesn't look appealing to you.  You rather build your own road.  Onethat goes far away from that confrontation.   But be assured of this,you will have to confront him one day willingly or unwillingly. >And you don't have a clue about what I'm saying, either.  Open your>eyes and SEE; open your ears and LISTEN.  I'm not just spouting off>empty words.  This is my LIFE, this is what gives me MEANING.I see what you mean.  I hear what your saying.  I am not degrading yourlife.  But I have heard the same irrational excuses for years.  There is nothing new in what you are saying.  And by your own words, you are "spouting off" contradictions.   If contradictions give you meaning, then your life mustbe sad.> I say my mother loves me.  How do I know, you ask?  I can point to> definite things she's done for me, and I can even just bring her to> you so you can ask her, face-to-face.> You say your deity loves you.  How do you know, I ask? Bingo.  For God so loved the world, he GAVE his only begotton to sonso that whososever belives in him will have ever lasting life.   I lookwhat God *did*.  He has given his Son, even to his death, so that I can have hope in his resurrection and know that life isn't for nothing, but hasglorious purpose.> You can't even convince me that it exists! Because you turn your eyes away from testimony and history.  You choose tolie to yourself that he doesn't exist, for you ignore what has been said for thousands of years.  You sound exactly, almost verbatim, like the Lazarus of Jesus's story starting in Luke 16:19.  And the conclusion of that story is a bleak one.  Lazarus wound up in hell.  The story ends like this:      "For if Lazarus doesn't even listen to Moses and the Prophets,       he won't even believe if a man rose from the dead."> If any god dangles 'heaven' before me like a carrot, promising untold> pleasures to me if I'll only suspend my disbelief and ignore my> rationality for just this once, then I would choose 'hell'.  I can> *not* lie to myself to placate another being, no matter how powerful> it is.Arrogance at its best.   The fact is, you are not rational.  Several specificcases  have already been cited.   And again with this new statement, you show more irrationality with regards to heaven.  Jesus does tell you something of what to expectin heaven.  Jesus expects you to use your brain to believe in him.  Jesus doesnot expect you to placate either.  Jesus wants you to willingly come to him, but notas his grovelling slave, but rather as his brother who will share in hisglorious riches.  Why do you not pick up the Bible and read it for yourself.  You maintain you have an open mind.  See whether you are lying to yourself foryourself.>>Why would you want to live a good life?>>To you, you die and that's it.  Don't contradict yourself.  You have>>no reason to live a good life.  It doesn't do you any good in the>>end.  Your life doesn't do anybody else any good  either because>>everyone dies anyway.  So you have no reason to lead a good life. Leading>>a good life is meaningless.   Why do you do such a meaningless thing?>That paragraph demonstrates that you haven't listened to a single word>I've said.I do understand what you said.   But that's is not what I feel went amiss here.You missed the point.  Living a "good life" has no eternal consequences.Once they close the amusement park of life, to you that is the end.  To you, it is over.  To you, therefore, your time spent in the amusement park is meaningless. It has no eternal consequences to you nor to anyone left on earth. But then you contradict yourself.  From a previous post, you said doing evil things is bad.  To you, it shouldn't matter if you do evil things or good things.  It isall meaningless in the end anyway.  So go rob a bank.  Go tell someoneyou dislike that he is a dirty rotten slime bag.  What's restraining you?Life after all, has no eternal consequences and accountability is irrelevant.> In the same way, I think life is fun.

Jesus is alive.  Jesus is NOT dead.So you (and your holy book) say.  By the same token, therefore, SantaClaus delivers toys every xmas.  Don't you see?  I have NO REASON tobelieve that what you say is true.  Please give me some reason that Ican't similarly apply to Santa Claus.You have EVERY reason to believe that what Jesus says and the witnessesof Jesus say are true.  But you choose to be unreasonable and "ignore" thereasons.  By definition, "ignorance". Santa Claus is said to live at the North Pole and have a squad of elvesand flying reindeer.   Ever see a flying reindeer?  Has anyone in humanhistory seen a flying reindeer?  Has anyone seen a reindeer whose nose blinks red?    On the other hand, are people born in Bethlehem?  Was Nebuchandezzar reallya king?  Was Daniel really one of his court officials?  Were David and Solomonreally kings of Israel and Judah?  Was their really a king called Jehoachin?Did Sennecherib really attack Jerusalem 600 years before Christ?  DidSennacherib really lose his battle--and badly?   Was there really a Caiaphas who interrogated Jesus?   Yes, yes, yes . . . history verifiesit.  It is NONFICTION.Do you have a problem discerning truth from fiction?  Perhaps youcan't evaluate the context of Grimm's Fairy Tales apart fromthat of the Scientific American.  I suppose you treat both with equaltruthfulness or equal falsity.  Is this what you are telling me?  Oris it that just do want to read the Scientific American and find outthat it's not a fairy tale?>Are you thereby inferring that your deity is nothing more than a>collection of verses in a book, and cannot be supported without>invoking them?Get real.

Here's the outcome from the research (condenced versions,copyright San Jose Mercury news):---  Bombings in the two largest cities in southern Lebanon killed 11 peopleand wounded 80 others. A car bomb blew up in Tyre, killing 10 people andwounding 75. A man was killed and five others seriously wounded in an explosion in Nabatiye.---  An Israeli navy patrol boat attacked and sank a rubber guerrilla boat offsouthern Lebanon early today, killing the two men aboard, the army command said.       It said in a communique that a Dvora patrol boat opened fire on the motorized rubber dinghy north of Tyre after identifying it as hostile. Thearmy said no one on the Israeli boat was injured. The affiliation of the slain guerrillas was not immediately known.---  Rival factions of the guerrilla group led by terrorist mastermind AbuNidal battled Sunday in Tyre, Lebanon, with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades, killing at least four people and wounding 15, police said.--- Lebanon's mainstream Shiite Muslim militia said Thursday that it had uncovered a network of tunnels in a southern Lebanese village where it saidpro-Iranian kidnappers had held Western hostages.       Officials of the militia, Amal, led local journalists through thecatacomb-like alleys and showed them two cells with iron doors at the village, Kawthariyet al Siyad, near Tyre, the ancient port city, about 40 milessouth of Beirut.       The officials said they were certain that U.S. Marine Lt. Col. WilliamR. Higgins was detained there shortly after he was seized by gunmen on a road outside Tyre in February 1988.--------------...anyway, I counted 20 articles during these 3 years of reporting. I alsofound out the possible reason why the numbers for the inhabitants of thecity is defined between 14000 and 24000. It seems that Tyre is one of theplaceswhere people from Libanon flee to during more extensive bombings, sothere'sa constant flow of refugees entering and leaving Tyre (articles mentionedthousands of people entering and leaving this place).I counted 0 articles for my home town, Kristinestad, so from now I willconsider this place to be a fishing village :-).Cheers,Kent---sandvik@newton.apple.com.

BTW, it applies to me.[deletia: Joe Gaut indicates his interest in the BD disaster is from acivil liberties issue, not an attempt to justify Koresh's beliefsand/or practices.]I agree with Joe about this: if some group wants to believe inwhatever god or Invisible Pink Unicorns and go off and live togetherand have group sex, or no sex, or sex only for the leaders (but NOTwith children), then, as much as I might believe them to be misguided,I think they should have the legal right.  And I hope theinvestigation will start by determining whether the feds had any*legitimate* reason for going after Koresh in the first place (beforemoving on to consider the wisdom of various tactics used).[Joe goes on to dispute the child-abuse allegations.  I'll(provisionally) accept this, unless someone has evidence to supportthe allegations?]Actually I wasn't thinking about the (alleged) child abuse, but aboutthe reports that he had sex with, and fathered children by, severalwomen in the cult.  I agree this is not a legal matter - consentingadults and all that - but Stephen Tice seems to be defending Koresh'sbeliefs and practices from specifically *Christian* perspective, not acivil liberties perspective.

Well, with what RIGHT can godmake that desicion? Let's say, for the sake of argument, that god creates everyone of us (directly or indirectly, it doesn't matter.). What then happens, isthat he first creates us, and then turns us lose. Well, I didn't ask to becreated. Let's make an analogue. If a scientist creates a unique living creature (whichhas happened, it was even patented...!!!), does he then have the right toexpect it to behave in a certain matter, or die...?Who is god to impose its rules on us ? Who can tell if god is REALLY sorighteous as god likes us to believe? Are all christians a flock of sheep,unable to do otherwise that follow the rest?

They aren't even real.  What scientists callan atom is nothing more than a mathematical model that describes certain physical, observable properties of our surroundings.  Allof which is subjective.  What is objective, though, is the approach a scientist takes in discussing his model and his observations.  Thereis no objective science.  But there is an objective approachwhich is subjectively selected by the scientist.  Objectivein this case means a specified, unchanging set of rules thathe and his colleagues use to discuss their science.This is in contrast to your Objective Morality.  There may be anobjective approach to subjectively discuss your beliefs onmorality.  But there exists no objective morality.Also, science deals with how we can discuss our observations of the physical world around us.  In that the method of discussionis objective ( not the science; not the discussion itself ).Science makes no claims to know the whys or even the hows sometimesof what we can observe.  It simply gives us a way to discuss oursurroundings in a meaningful, consistent way.I think it was Neils Bohr who said (to paraphrase) Science is whatwe can _say_ about the physical world.-jim halat

You have to ask the insurer: "Would my policycover an abortion?" to find out.  If it does, you should have aright to decline that "coverage" if YOU DON'T WANT IT.The basic premise in private insurance is that you pay for thecoverage YOU WANT.  If basically you want "catastrophic coverage"you get a policy with a high deductible (with a correspondinglyLOWER premium).  Similarly, you don't have to be COMPELLED totake on a policy covering things like liposuction or hairtransplantation, if you DON'T WANT THAT KIND OF COVERAGE, again,at a corresponding savings to you.If you don't want to be "covered" for abortion, you should not beCOMPELLED to.  To millions of Christians, abortion is not a"gynocological examination" or a "pap smear."  To them abortionis murder.  To them, being "covered for abortion" means that theyare paying for a "service," which THEY THINK IS EVIL, CLEARLYDON'T WANT, and will NEVER USE.  In such a case, all that ishappening is that they are being COMPELLED to help pay for OTHERPEOPLE'S abortions.When you are being forced to BUY something you DON'T WANT andwill NEVER USE, this is called extortion.When the mafia tells a restaurant owner to "buy" a "juke-box" forthe owner's "protection" this is called racketeering. And if one's access to health care is held hostage to signing adefacto "loyalty oath" in support of abortion, by promising tohelp pay for other people's abortions (when one is clearlyopposed to this procedure) this is tantamount to the same thing.dennisdzkriz@ocf.berkeley.edu

That would certainly explain why they've been lying about the whole thing -- that kind of screw-up really *would* be embarrassing, wouldn't it?  There is of course only one weak spot in this theory -- we only have the FBI's WORD that the guys setting the fire were wearing black, and you've already demonstrated that the FBI consists of bald-faced liars.  From this we can immediately conclude that they were not in fact wearing black, and that that description was part of the FBI cover-up.  Who was it really?  Come on, now, think -- who is really out to embarrass the Clinton administration?  The answer is so obvious I don't see how you could have missed it.  That's right -- it was Robert Dole and the Senate Republicans, of course.  And it worked, too: Clinton immediately backed down on the stimulus package, didn't he?>Still, it is something to think about.Uh huh.  Later he writes:>[...] The tear gas cannisters---which do produce heat>despite what you may have been told by the media---may have contributed>to starting the blaze.  Now I'm getting confused.  Did the tear gas canisters start the fire before or after the lantern, and when was that in relation to when the ATF started it?  Oh, by the way, the story I've been hearing is that no canisters were used, since they didn't want to start a fire (but we of course only have their word on that).As you may be able to tell, I'm not exactly persuaded.-- Steve Schaffner        sschaff@unixhub.slac.stanford.eduThe opinions expressed may be mine, and may not be those of SLAC, Stanford University, or the DOE.

My rasberry award goes to Dave Palmerwho makes the following benediction after spewing out the facts,"Score another one for the forces of ignorance and superstition"as if the public deaths of over 80 people were not a clear and definite warning as to what happens to people who follow false prophets.From where I set, looks like Satan has a three-bagger going.In article <1993Apr20.051902.9472@gw.wmich.edu> x86carnell@gw.wmich.edu writes:>In article <C5rLps.Fr5@world.std.com>, jhallen@world.std.com (Joseph H Allen) writes:>> In article <1qvk8sINN9vo@clem.handheld.com> jmd@cube.handheld.com (Jim De Arras) writes:>>>I'm short of patience tonite, but rabid dogs deserve and get better treatment  >>>than the BDs got.>> >> Although I'm an atheist, the events in Waco have really sickened me.

One can argue aboutthe initial raid, but it would be worth mentioning, before the facts getlost, that1. The Branch Davidians were tipped off that the BATF was comingduring the initial raid.2. The Branch Davidians opened fire first.It is also worth noting that the Branch Davidians, according tothe FBI's statements, opened fire immediately when the FBI issued the warningover the phone, and that the vehicle which launched the tear gas grenadesdid so under fire from the compound.>>> >> The killing of the four BATF agents was surey a dispicable act, but that was>> an escalation of the confrontation which the BATF started.  War is bad>>Even this seemingly obvious issue is far from settled.  According to>"Newsweek" (4/5/93), "some federal law-enforcement officials>now believe that at least some ATF agents were brought down by>friendly fire."  The articles goes on to say how "sources" close to the>Justice Department claim that some agents were caught in "heavy crossfire."Clearly, no one in the government wanted a repeat of the initial shootout, That's why they went in with riot control gas. This would have workedwith minimal casualties (The Branch Davidians apparently did not have gasmasks) if Koresh had not had a very different reaction in mind.>>>> precisely because of humanity's tendancy for escalation.

(likely ?).They both indicated that they had no idea that a Masada-like mass suicidecould result from the introduction of non-lethal agents into the compound.Some of these issues are highly technical - the impression I haveis that the "Ranch Apocalypse" represented a Rubrik's cube for thecounterterrorist types. The Branch Davidians were too well armed for for a simple assault (the BATF found this out the hard way). The complexwas probably to big for the kind of "surgical" Delta Force coup de mainthat the Bundesgrenschutz did in the 1970s when one of their airlinerswas highjacked by "Black September". The reason this seige had gone onas long as it had was that the government really didn't have any good options,and to wait it out was the safest and most logical choice.>>Similarly, why the raid yesterday?  Reno has a bunch of different>answers she's shopping around, none f which make much senOn>Nightline tonight, she tried the "we were concerned about child abuse">card, and then it was pointed out that the info. on the child abuse>was over two weeks old.  Then she switched to the "It couldn't go>on any longer"-style stuff until that kind of played out.My own theory is that something was supposed to have happenedon Easter. Koresh had made some statements building that idea up, and Easter came and went with nothing happening. It may be that the authoritiesfelt emboldened to move for this reason. IT IS just a theory.>>Why yesterday?  Because this was turning into a huge embarassment for>the Clinton administration.I don't believe this is a valid argument. Obviously, hindsightis 20/20, but the risks of doing anything to provoke the Davidianswere clear enough to warrant caution and to delay action.>>> > It was interesting to watch the 700 club today.

This matter ties in with the infamous "social scientists are notreally scientists" brouhaha on sci.skeptic. Here is a case where, ifone believes the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI, thepredictions of psychological experts were proven false, not underlaboratory conditions, but in the cauldron of practical application.2. Koresh's actions (or the actions of whoever started the fire - we're not likely to know what went on in there) contrast so violentlywith the example of Christ that I'm sure many Christians find itdifficult to understand why or how this happened. Under such conditions, the search for scapegoats is only too natural a humanreaction, even though that is not a particularly Christian responseeither.3. Koresh's mother apparently had some false hopes that the cult members had sought refuge in a bunker somewhere in the complex. Her grief must be monumental at this time, and the search for a way toescape moral responsibility for her family's destruction is likewisereal. We may not have seen the end to the self depravation.4. The fact, simply stated, is that a good number of innocent childrenand not-so-innocent adults died horribly for no good reason. It isexceptionally hard for us, as human beings, to accept this fact.We can hope for some ultimate salvation, some panacea to make itbetter, but even though hope is a wonderful thing, that doesn'tmake it so. There is no meaning to this thing. It just is.Bill R.--"When up a dangerous faction starts,         "My opinions do not representWith wrath and vengeance in their hearts;     those of my employer orBy solemn League and Cov'nant bound,          any government agency."To ruin, slaughter, and confound;             - Bill Riggs (1993)To turn religion to a fable,And turn the Government to a Babel;Pervert the law, disgrace the gown,Corrupt the senate, rob the crown;To sacrifice old England's glory,And make her infamous in story.When such a tempest shook the land,How could unguarded virtue stand ?"- Jonathan Swift (1732)

I strongly oppose abortion for reasons of conscience and amdisturbed greatly that my coverage may be being used in thismanner.  However, I depend on my employers' provided healthcoverage, and fear that if I speak up about it, that I may losenot only my coverage but even my job.I would like to ask you to put into law the provision that healthinsurance providers make abortion coverage non-compulsory intheir health insurance program, so that it can be declined, withan appropriate reduction in premium.In order that there be no difference in the dollar ammount in thehealth benefit packages between those who would choose to haveabortion coverage and those who would not, I further ask that youinclude a provision in which the reduction in premium resultingfrom the declining of "abortion coverage" be paid-out to theemployee, rather than pocketed by the employer.  This second provision should serve to dissuade employers frompressuring employees into taking one or the other stand withregard to abortion services.  Thank you very much.

Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where hemet three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  Kellner's efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by FranzHartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked togetherprior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902in Reuss's Masonic publication, 'Oriflamme'.  On Kellner's death,Reuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The 'Jubilee' edition ofthe 'Oriflamme', published in 1912, announced that the Order taughtsecret of sexual magic. "Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 inAugsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist andpossibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the SocialistLeague founded by Karl Marx's daughter and her husband.  Reuss waslater associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the GoldenDawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss tofound the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After severalattempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on thedevelopment of the O.T.O."The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss' leadership.For example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlinand H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting betweenReuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him andaccused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him forthe first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of allthe English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invokedwhen publishing the material of the Equinox."Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering astroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a breakin the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.over the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.He had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss's request, deeplyinfusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation."_An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX'Within _Equinox III:10_, Edited by   Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,    Caliph of the United States of America,      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.There are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included thismaterial in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?Why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his ownorganization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principleof Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth verycomplex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves roomfor very many interpretations.It is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derivedout of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksterswith an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And Ican take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeblesupport of the 'Law of Thelema' is laughable at best.Would I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  Will I?  I think not.Why?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjectionI am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express thingsin the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may bequite difficult to apprehend at first.So it may be with OTO and Merlinus X'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.I do not support Reuss's words myself, as I am not qualified to assessthem, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member ofthe Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, thenwhat can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean thatthe Order has 'gone soft' and abandoned its moral principles?  Ordoes it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will ofuniversal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmaticrequirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?I find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.They are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcaneor usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  Having met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are orwere very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrityof the organization as it stands.I have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments I followed my intuition, and I've found little to stop me from requestinga Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I'm happily participatingin social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the GnosticMass well enough for my tastes. This doesn't make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however.I can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on mylimited contact with other members.I urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are manyways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved withthe Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedomand the preservation of individual vision.I welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in responseto other posts in this thread.Invoke me under my stars.  Love is the law, love under will.I am I!Frater (I) Nigris (DCLXVI) CCCXXXIII

I could not with a clear conscience accept that women weresomehow not equal to men, that homosexuals are "guilty" of theirlifestyle, that pride in one's work is a bad thing, that Jesus diedfor me -- I don't want ANYBODY to die for me, especially as animpersonal act where the person can't possibly even *know* me wellenough to really know if I'm worth dying for or not.I was never able to accept the bit about Jesus's death being a goodthing.  If that means that I'm just not comprehending a basic messageof Christianity, then so be it.  Maybe I'm just not compatible withChristianity.  I just refuse to follow rules blindly, and since Ican't even convince myself that your god even EXISTS in the way youdescribe it, I've got to just follow my own conscience in these matters.>I know how that goes.

Don't think that my morals are shoddy or nonexistent just because Idon't believe in your god.  I will not steal, and I will not murder --not because I fear divine repudiation, but because these just *aren't*in my character.  You may think there's nothing keeping me from justrunning around on a murdering spree, stealing things when I'm able,insulting people for the heck of it, because I'm not answerable toanyone; but you'd be wrong.  I'm answerable to myself.  A life likethat would be a cheap life; I happen to want to earn respect in myself.>'Till I met the Man, that is.My initial break with Christianity came after a lot of soul-searchingand a lot of wondering why I could no longer feel the 'presence' ofGod with me.  I finally decided that I had once "felt" this presencejust as I had "felt" my mighty teddy bear beside me when I was alittle tyke, protecting me from the monsters under the bed -- that Ihad believed in God just as I had believed in the teddy bear, assomething of an emotional crutch to protect me from perceived dangers.Since then, I've never abandoned the possibility that maybe yoursupernatural trinity does exist.  But there are a few times when, inmy darkened room by my bed, I have set aside everything I believe fora moment and called out to whatever's out there, because I want toknow the truth even if it means abandoning everything I know.  And Ihave not yet received an answer.>= Only when I truly listened to myself, body and soul, did I realize>= that I could no longer honestly keep up the charade of being>= Christian.  There is a higher truth in the universe, and Christianity>= just ain't it.>>Any suggestions on what (or who or where) it might be, and why?Nope.  It may well be unknowable.  Scientists have suggested that theuniverse may be finite and wrap around on itself (the three-dimensionaluniverse may be mapped onto a four-dimensional supersphere in the sameway you can map a two-dimensional plane onto a three-dimensionalsphere; see _Sphereland_, the sequel to _Flatland_, for more thoughtson this).  Our entire universe might just be an electron in a four-dimensional universe, which in turn may only be an insignificant speckin a universe above that, and so on and so forth until the variablesbecome too much for us to even speculate on.That is, there's no possible way for us to know exactly how we came tobe, so there's no reason at all to believe that your God exists norhad anything to do with it.>"OK," you may say. "So now, if I'm just being good, am I doing good enough?">>That's for you to answer.  If you feel you're doing fine, then go ahead and>ignore us foolish little Christians.

Christians have provided me with nothing except quotes from your holybook, and all sorts of tactics to try to get me to believe: guilttrips, insinuations that I'm without morals, arguments from disbelief("how can you possibly believe that God *doesn't* exist?"), and soforth.  All I'm asking is for you to convince me.  I want to be convinced,but it's not going to be easy.>So much as you don't like what we're "selling", there just may be someone>out there that can identify with it.  Methinks you could give us all a >lesson in tolerance and back off.Having had years upon years of contact with your religion from boththe inside and the outside, I view it as harmful in many ways.  Itpreys on people who want to find meaning in their lives, and once it'sgot these people, it teaches them to have pity (and sometimes starklyintolerant) of others who do not share these views.  Maybe you'll saythat your religion doesn't teach that -- but I've got to judgeChristianity from the Christians I know.I feel that it is entirely possible and good to have faith in one'sself, and to be a positive influence on society for no better reasonthan that.So I hope that my words in this newsgroup will at least make somepeople think.  I want Christians to realize that there are perfectlyvalid lifestyles and opinions that have nothing to do with their deitywhatsoever, and I want people who are considering Christianity torealize that Christianity does not hold the sole key to a happy,fulfilled life.I have known some very nice Christians who have done some very nicethings.  I think what sets these people apart from the general massesis that they recognize that their religious beliefs may be wrong, andthey know the weaknesses of their religion, yet they still decide tobelieve, but they keep their beliefs to themselves and do not thinkany less of people who don't agree with them.>Obviously, the debate on the veracity and reliability of the Source of the>Christian's faith is far from conclusive, notwithstanding how vehemently we>propose otherwise.Precisely my point.

As a Latter-day Saint, I believe that all of us (you,me, etc.) lived once as spirit-children of God the Father (Hebrews 12:9)in the pre-mortal existance. In order to continue our eternal progression,an earthly probationary time was required.  (To live by faith, not bysight, to choose good over evil, and to prepare ourselves in all thingsto become worthy of a higher order of existance.)  We believe that all ofGod's spirit-offspring were once assembled to discuss the specifics ofthis earthly sojourn.  One-third chose for Lucifer's plan, most followedthe Firstborn (the pre-mortal Jesus Christ).  Lucifer's aspirations ("Iwill exalt my throne above the stars of God . . ." Isaiah 14:12-17, etc.)resulted into the rebellion of his followers against the Firstborn andthose who followed Him, resulting in the casting out of Lucifer (whobecame Satan, the father of lies) and one-third of the hosts of heaven("And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did castthem to the earth . . ." Revelation 12:4) as demons (evil spirits).To get back on OUR choice to be born on this earth, and to be subject toGod and His plan (for good or bad, based upon our obedience and choices),we made that choice individually.  (God speaking to Job: "Where wast thouwhen I laid the foundations of the earth, . . . when the morning starssang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?" Job 38:4-7).  Welost the knowledge of our pre-mortal existance (the "Veil of Forgetful-ness," somewhere in Psalms), in order to live by faith, not by sight.You may not accept this scenario, neither do quite a few who rely on theBible alone, which offers only fragmentary insights into this particularaspect of our existence as individuals, as sons and daughters of God.#Who is god to impose its rules on us ? Who can tell if god is REALLY so#righteous as god likes us to believe? Are all christians a flock of sheep,#unable to do otherwise that follow the rest?##Hmmmmmmmmmmmm.(All Christians, by definition, ARE a flock of sheep, following the Shepherdas they understand Him  ;-)  --But in any event, not all Christians believein the same theology, such as the one Latter-day Saints believe in.  (Theywill cry "heresy" and other accusations of "perverting" the doctrines ofthe Bible, while they themselves believe in a myriad of interpretations, asfound in their catechisms and various do-it-yourself Bible-study manuals...)As for me, I have a personal conviction that the pre-existance scenario asexplained above, is most in harmony with Biblical doctrine, some Dead SeaScroll books, the pseudographion, other (Jewish) sources, and last but notleast, modern-day revelation on the subject.#I just want to point out that this is not sarcasm, I mean it.##                        How should one deal with a man who is convinced that#                        he is acting according to God's will, and who there-#     Jokke              fore believes that he is doing you a favour by#                        stabbing you in the back?##                                                        -VoltaireCasper C.

Maybe there's a clearindication that the way you lived your life produced a certain amount of anxiety that needed to be released. Religion was onepossible medicine. While my more stable environment didn't and still does not produce the situation where I feel such guilt.This is just one possible explanation why you feel this burden,while I haven't felt it so far.Regards,Kent---sandvik@newton.apple.com.

Remember what Spock said:"the needs of the few outweight the needs of the many".As long as government spending does not contradict the ConstitutionI don't see any problems in a case where the people have selected a group of people to make decisions in one direction. And if this is bad, then we should elect a new government. Democratic systems workthis way, and I don't have anything against you raising an opinionin your case. I just hope you realize that each individual should make theirown judgement, and posting pre-filled letters sounds like youdon't trust your fellow Americans to utter their own opinion,just your own.Cheers,Kent---sandvik@newton.apple.com.

I don't know if someone else would have caught this, though I am sure thatsomeone would be able to do so, but I have an aversion to disseminatingmistakes, especially when someone else might use that mistake to prove a point" _____________________________________________________________________ MY REPLY...Vary noble of you Dave.  I didn't want to have to go to x number of sources toshow you wrong.  (Although I am researching CHORION a little). DB..."Of course the only other reference Mr DeCenso has given is Bullinger.  AndBullinger uses such ridiculous exegisis that when I accused Mr DeCenso ofactually believing Bullinger, he replied that I misquoted him: >> "And you maintain that you find such exegesis convincing?  Oh dear.">> My Reply...> Your misquotes of me are astounding, Dave.  Read the beginning of this partof > my response to see what I REALLY said in my posting of this article.  [Actually Mr DeCenso, you said that there was "benefit" to our argument, in  that it caused to to rediscover Bullinger's exegisis.  I did not realize  that you would find such garbage beneficial, unless you were convinced by  it]." MY REPLY...Thank you for correcting your restating of my points. DB..."and Mr DeCenso also replied: > Dave, these are not necessarily my views; they are Bullinger's.  WE will> discuss the land issue in later posts, I'm sure.  I'm only responding to>this one you have directed re: Bullinger's views because it's enjoyable. Thus I apologize for thinking that even Mr DeCenso could find such "drek"convincing....he should specify which parts of Bullinger he finds convincingand quit hiding behind a disingenuous mask of "This is what Bullingerbelieved, not necessarily what I believe." So which is it Mr DeCenso? Do youfind the exegisis convincing or not?)" MY REPLY...One of my purposes in debating these alleged contradictions with you andothers is to diseminate many different views of possible reconciliationsraised by various Bible scholars and students alike.  When I present MY VIEWS,I will clearly distinguish them from now on. DB..."Of course without Archer and Bullinger we find that Mr DeCenso has presentedno Greek exegisis at all, and Mr DeCenso has made a big thing about my notreferring back to the actual Greek.  Thus we find this demand on his part forquality Greek exegisis to be a hypocritical requirement." MY REPLY...Good point.  But in your declaring that these passages are contradictory, youhave produced only superficial reasonings and observations. Nor have you dugdeeper.  I'm glad you have begun in this post.  I will begin Greek studies onthese passages in more depth than I thought necessary, as well. DB..."It would be appropriate to look at what Mr DeCenso has actually USED asevidence.  Now we know what he claims for a standard, as he has stated itoften enough: > (a) the text itself> (b) parallel passages> (c) other pertinent Scriptures> (d) historical context> (e) historical content> (f) other pertinent historical info> (g) cultural context> (h) cultural content> (i) other pertinent cultural info> (j) grammatical construction> (k) Hebrew and Greek word studies> (l) etc. But are these actual standards he has used, or simply empty hyperbole.  Let'ssee, he has used (a), and since he is trying to reconcile it to otherpassages, we see that he has also used (b).  On the other hand he haspresented no use of: (d) historical context                or(e) historical content                or(f) other pertinent historical info   or(g) cultural context                  or(h) cultural content                  or(i) other pertinent cultural info     or(j) grammatical construction          or even(k) Hebrew and Greek word studies [remember, Archer and Bullinger don't count] Thus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings." MY REPLY...Question:  Do you find such criteria important?  If so, do you plan on startingto use them to the best of your ability, or will you continue to presentshallow observations (I don't mean this in a bad way).At this point in our _debates_, I have not found it necessary to present atotal exegetical analysis of these passages, since we seem to keep beatingaround the bush and not getting into the core of the verses.  I do not believeit necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re:Judas in Acts and Matthew, but I will do my best from this point on to useseveral of the above criteria, since you desire me to.  I hope you will also.It will greatly enhance our study of these passages. DB..."The only thing he has actually used, beyond the passage itself, is any otherpassage.  Thus Mr DeCenso should be honest and note that most of his list isred herring and his only real criteria seems to be: > (a) the text itself> (b) parallel passages MY REPLY...The reason is simple...you are mistating the passages.  You claim that thePASSAGES contradict one another; I do not see the PASSAGES contradicting oneanother.(1) They may very well be complimentary, as many scholarly sources mention;(2) Matthew may not be presenting Judas' death, as you claim.  But we'll lookat your defense of this later. Also, the "reward of iniquity" in the Acts PASSAGE may not be the 30 pieces ofsilver in Matthew's PASSAGES.  (Although you have a valiant attempt later atstating why you believe it is). At this beginning stages in our debates, we are laying some Scripturalgroundwork, which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis. DB..."Of course the only reason I can see to so drastically reinterpret a passageas he has done with Judas' death, is to make it agree with another passage sothat both could be considered correct." MY REPLY...One of the reasons I have given a different exegetical view of the passages isthat you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding thesepassages are complimentary.  However, I see no problem in Tony Rose'sexplanation of Judas' death... _____________________________________________________________________ HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGINGHIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND "FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN"============================================================= This question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we areconstantly confronted in our travels. Many people point to the apparentdiscrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error.Some have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible isdestroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case atall.Matthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell andwas crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but dothey necessarily contradict each other?Matthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say thatJudas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person callingsomething black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can betrue and supplementary.A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on theedge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung therefor some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judasfell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit thisexplanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of thevalley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can seerocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks onthis way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we arenot told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advancedwas the decomposition of his body before his fall.Louis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself.This individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed apistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window atthe same time.On the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shootinghimself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumpingform the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in thecase of Matthew's and Peter's accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely asituation of different perspectives of the same event. _____________________________________________________________________ Your only reason for rejecting this is, I believe, your attempt to discreditinerrancy.  You haven't related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely.Here's what you said in an earlier post... _____________________________________________________________________DB [quoting Tony Rose]...> There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.> Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks> on this way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we>                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> are not told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> was the decomposition of his body before his fall. "The added text in this version is so heavy that, assuming you are truly soopposed to such tactics, you should find it not credible.  But you seem tofind Tony Rose's eisegesis satisfactory, while clearly rejecting DavidJoslin's." _____________________________________________________________________ Here, you discredit Tony's explanation based on what you deem too "heavy" forthe passages.  But you haven't addressed why you feel that way.  You can sayit's a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesn't tell me itdidn't happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility. Questions:  Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying?  Or are they both lying?  Orare either or both of them misinformed?  Why do you think there is such analleged contradiction?  I do not think you have ever told us what you believein this respect. DB..."At present though, Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me: > (1) You claim Acts and Matthew contradict one another in representing Judas'>     death.  I ask you again to provide evidence that Matthew stated Judas>     died in the hanging.> (2) You claim that the 30 pieces of silver in Matthew that Judas threw down>     in the temple and the chief priests used, is the "reward of iniquity">     in Acts that pictures Judas in some way purchasing a field with;>     therefore there is a contradiction.  Prove that the 30 pieces of silver>     and the "reward of iniquity" are one and the same. Actually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answerit because he now restricts himself to two points.  First I would point outthat hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.  In fact it is abit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboymovies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging." MY REPLY...I work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.  Today, I got acall re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his motheris on crack.  He failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at alocal hospital.  Hanging attempts are not always successful. To assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is"begging the question", if I may quote you. [Last night, listening to _The Bible Answer Man_ broadcast, The ChristianResearch Institute's show, one of the scholars on there used several of theseterms that you use.  I am not all that familiar with them.  The man on the BAMshow teaches Comparative Religion and Logic.  It was interesting] DB..."This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no otherqualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself." MY REPLY...Qualifiers are important at times, as we'll see in an OT passage I'll mentionbelow.Does hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source wehave re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it'ssynonymous means it has the same meaning as.  A boy (age 14) hung himself.  Buthe lived.  This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we candiscover. DB..."Now I am not alone in this thought; in fact, since Mr DeCenso so respectsChristian scholarly (including Greek scholars) opinion, I did some research." MY REPLY...Thank you, Dave. DB..."Interestingly, not one of the Christian references I read, interpreted thehanging as being anything but a fatal suicide.              ^^^^^^^^^^^ MY REPLY...[^^^ above, mine]So it's OK to use Christian sources to back your points?  What about Tony'sposition.  Do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility? Also, is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong, or lying, ordeceived in other parts of their books?  If so, should we do, as we have donewith Archer, toss them to the side and not value anything they say, includingtheir "interpretation" of the hanging of Judas?  I am sure _you_ would findsome errors and maybe even some deception in those sources. You also noted they "interpreted" the hanging as meaning he died.  Althoughthat is very possibly true, do you find that in the text itself?  Remember,that's the first criteria we must examine. DB..."This included:     "The Biblical Knowledge Commentary" by Woodward and Zuck" MY REPLY...Which I own.  It's a good source of commentary info.  But not inerrant. DB...    "The Interpreters on Volume Commentary on the Bible" by Laydon    "The one volume Bible Commentary" by J R Dunelow    "Word meanings of the Testament" Ralph Earl    "The Abingdon Bible Commentary" published by Abingdon    "Harpers Bible Commentary" by William Neal     (Actually I could have presented many more as well) MY REPLY...I appreciate your doing this research, Dave.  Maybe we are getting somewherein how we both should approach these alleged contradictions - more in depthstudy. DB..."In each case, these references specifically describe that the interpretationof Matt 27:5 as successful, suicide and thus I can only conclude that the                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Greek word "apagchw"(ie: hang oneself) is translated as a successful hanging." MY REPLY...[^^^ above, mine]No you can't only conclude this, although, as Tony says, this was a highlyprobable outcome.  But Matthew does not state death as being a result. The Greek word is APAGCHO.  Matthew 27:5 is it's only occurrence in the NewTestament. In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus),it's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : "Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice wasnot followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to hiscity. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and hewas buried in his father's tomb."             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel "hanged himself" [Gr. Sept.,APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, "and died".  Here we have no doubt of theresult.In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died. Also, there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure.  It simplymeans "hang oneself". DB..."But Mr DeCenso, you are more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable                                                                     ^^^^^^^^^Christian scholars that insist that the hanging was not successful." MY REPLY...[^^^above, mine]"Reputable"?  You mean ones that have never erred?As far as   insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful, that can't be done,even by me. ^^^^^^^^^ As I said in an earlier post... _____________________________________________________________________Although I still agree with Tony's exegesis as being the most probableexplanation regarding Judas' death (taking into account several criteria),I've recently noticed some new things in Matthew. MAT 27:5-8 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,and went and hanged himself. But the chief priests took the silver pieces andsaid, "It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are theprice of blood." And they consulted together and bought with them the potter'sfield, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field ofBlood to this day. First of all, notice that the text does not say that Judas died as a result ofhanging. All it says is that he "went and hanged himself." Luke however, inActs, tells us that "and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and allhis entrails gushed out." This is a pretty clear indication (along with theother details given in Acts - Peter's speech, the need to pick a new apostle,etc.) that at least after Judas' fall, he was dead. So the whole concept that                                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Matthew and Luke both recount Judas' death is highly probable, but not clear^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^cut.^^^_____________________________________________________________________ I also wrote... _____________________________________________________________________MY REPLY... Here we have a stickler, Dave, that I have to say I just recently noticed.Let's look at the passage in Matthew: MAT 27:4 saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." And they said,"What is that to us? You see to it!" MAT 27:5 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,and went and hanged himself. MAT 27:6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, "It is notlawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood." MAT 27:7 And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field,to bury strangers in. MAT 27:8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day. Notice verse 5..."Then he...went and hanged himself."Matthew does not say Judas died, does it?  Should we assume he died as aresult of the hanging?                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^What does Acts say?ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; andfalling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out. ACT 1:20 "For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place bedesolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.' Here we may have a graphic explanation of Judas' death....So, my line ofreasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re:the "two" accounts of Judas'death is this...Matthew doesn't necessarily explain how Judas died; he does                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^say Judas "hanged himself", but he didn't specifically say Judas died in thehanging incident.               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^However, Acts seems to show us his graphic demise.  Therefore, there is nocontradiction between Matthew and Acts re: Judas' `death'. ....... MY REPLY......we do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably recordshis death.  Although it's possible and plausible that he fell from the hangingand hit some rocks, thereby bursting open, I can no longer assume that to bethe case.  Therefore, no contradiction.  Matthew did not say Judas died as a                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^result of the hanging, did he?  Most scholars believe he probably did, but...?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^______________________________________________________________________ I quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars' explanations, butin looking at the texts initially, we can't assume Judas died.  It is, however,highly probable.                            ^^^^^^ DB..."By the way, while all agree that Judas died from the hanging, the books haddifferent ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing.  Onesimply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to Matthew's version asthe correct version in both Matt and Acts.  "The Biblical Knowledge Commentary"suggested the hypotheses that Judas hung and then when he rotted, his bellyexploded (which doesn't explain his headlong fall), or that his branch or ropebroke, and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out (which doesn't explainhow a hanging man, would fall headlong rather than feet first)." MY REPLY...The outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the personwas suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that mayhave deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fellupon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc.  In asuperficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage, we are notgiven a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but Tony in the above quotedpost gave us some... _____________________________________________________________________A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on theedge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom.

Of course a Biblical inerrantistwho claim that every word of the Bible is guaranteed true by God, will have tothereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas (ie: where theprophesy of the Potter's field came from)." MY REPLY...Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discussthis with you. DB...As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that themoney with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, ratherthan some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specificallymention "the reward of iniquity" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentionswhat act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 "...concerningJudas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.").  Now I would point outthat when the Bible describes an act of "iniquity," and then immediatelydiscusses "*the* reward of iniquity," it would be rather inane to suggest thatit was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed." MY REPLY...Dave, we are getting somewhere, aren't we! ACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples(altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said,ACT 1:16 "Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the HolySpirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guideto those who arrested Jesus;ACT 1:17 "for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry."ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; andfalling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.ACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that fieldis called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.)ACT 1:20 "For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place bedesolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.' Notice that in verse 16, the word "iniquity" is not used.  Rather, it statesthat Judas "became a guide to those who arrested Jesus".But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, "for he was numbered with us andobtained a part in this ministry."  What part did Judas play in their ministry?         ^^^^^^JOH 12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was athief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it.JOH 13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus hadsaid to him, "Buy those things we need for the feast," or that he should givesomething to the poor. So, now we know what part Judas played - he was a treasurer, per se.Right after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer,according to John), THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of "wages ofiniquity" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolenby Judas to purchase a field.  I believe this is a better exegeticalexplanation of what the "wages of iniquity" are.  What do you think, Dave? DB..."Now since I have given you clear answers (and even references), perhaps youcould unequivocally state what type of inerrantist you are (instead of askingme what type I think you are, as you did to Mr Joslin)."

Did you knowthat according to the Bible, there shouldn't even be such things as"priests" anymore?  Do you know why the preisthood was established inthe Old Testament to begin with and the reasons why after Jesus,there were no priests--that is until the Roman Catholic Church 300 years later devised the doctrine of transubstantiation by ignoringthe whole concept beyond the book of Hebrews?You said you analyzed the Bible very closely.  I think you arelying.  For if you had, I would think you would have at leastgot the doctrine of hell straight.So what is your beef against Jesus?  Be specific and point onverses.

Worthwhile.  Laughs & serious questions about real religion.Keywords: Eveism, religion, Nntp-Posting-Host: rs6101.ecs.rpi.eduOrganization: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy NYDate: Thu, 22 Apr 1993 00:08:06 GMTLines: 102Let me begin by saying I think this is the world's first religion to usethe net as its major recruitment medium.  Therefore, even if thisreligion does not take off, its founding members will be very importanthistorically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become common.The basis of this religion is to apply various aspects of current conventionalmorality to the characters in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the Bible'saccounts of the facts and historical events is correct.For example,Story of Adam and Eve:Adam and Eve are in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant.  Have unlimitedsupply of food provided, but no clothing, jobs, or knowledge.  God saysnot to eat fruit of tree of knowledge.  They do anyway, then try to hide in bushes.  God finds them and forces them out of Garden.(There are several different stories on what they were doing while naked inthe bushes that might have angered God.)Traditional Philosophy:1. The only reason you need knowledge or a job is to eat.  If someone else willprovide you with food, then you can be stupid and unemployed and it's OK. Thisis why married women usually didn't work until recent decades.2. Authority figures, such as God, whoever was behind the Vietnam War, Hitler and slaveowners, are always right and should be blindly followed without question by ordinary people, who can't make decisions for themselves.Interpretation of events based on Traditional Philosophy:They were not supposed to eat the fruit.  They should have done whatever Godtold them to.  Like small children, they had their needs provided for and wereobligated to do whatever their "Father" said to.  Being forced to leave the Garden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment.Lessons from Traditional Interpretation:1.  Ignorance is good.  Knowledge is bad, but tempting.2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read "welfare") is ideal.  Get-ting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment.3.  Public nudity is good.  Covering up is bad.4.  Authority figures are intrinsically right.  Normal people are dumb and should do whatever they are told without question.  They should not think for themselves.5.  People in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain fromlearning.  For example, it should be illegal for slaves to learn to read.1990's philosophy:1.  People should seek education and employment outside the home, unlessnamed "Hillary Clinton" or "Murphy Brown".2.  People should use common sense.  They should not kill other people (binding of Issac, wars, Holocaust, etc.) just because they are told to.Interpretation of events based on current philosophy:They were supposed to eat the fruit.  God gave wanted them to seek knowledgerather than be handed it on a silver platter.  Once they had gained knowledgeand (by seeking it) showed their ability to make mature decisions for them-selves, they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were REWARDED by being allowed into the "real world."Lessons from new interpretation:1.  Ignorance is bad.  Knowledge is good, but must be sought.2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read "welfare") is at besta temporary measure.  Getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earnis ideal.3.  Public nudity is bad.  Covering up is good.4.  Authority figures are often wrong.  Normal people are intelligent andshould consider whether the instructions are really a good idea and "alteror abolish" bad governments.  They should think for themselves.5.  People in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledgebut should seek it anyway, and all the harder.  For example, poor children without good schools should work especially hard in order to make a betterlife for their children (and themselves).I have tentatively named this new philosophy "The Church of Eveism" becauseEve's decision to eat the apple is man[sic]kind's first good decision, insteadof its first bad one, as traditionally believed.  She is therefore clearlya protagonist.  God at first appears evil, for telling people not to seek knowledge but on deeper analysis is also a protagonist.  As God rewarded thedecision to defy him, and provided the tree in the first place, the intentionand desire were clearly to have the knowledge be obtained, but to delay it until it was actively sought.---End serious discussion.  Begin humor.--Save this post to disk (or file server).  Someday it will be considered themost important writing since the 10 Commandments.  You want an original copy.Stay tuned for the RFD on soc.religion.eveism...Can I get a tax deduction for money I donate to this organization?--Return to serious discussion when posting follow-ups.--Stephen Weinsteinweinss@rpi.edu

I *never* thought I'd be defending religiouspeople (especially extremists), but I *am* mourning the murders ofDavid Koresh and his followers. I believe they deserved the rightto life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and the right to worshipas they saw fit. Those rights (and the lives of innocent men, women(some pregnant), and children) were sacrificed to save the FederalGovernment from being embarrassed. Had the Branch Davidians takentheir case to court, the black eye the BATF earned themselves wouldhave been multiplied many times over.I also mourn the deaths of the BATF agents although the deceptionscarried out against them by our government were nothing compared tothe atrocities against the Branch Davidians.Attorney General "Vampira" claims to have made the best decision shecould based on the information she was given. This is possible. Officialsin higher positions than hers have been duped. We have no choice sowe may as well give her another chance. Even if she is truly evil,it is doubtful that she'll kill more than a few hundred at a time.I'm considering joining the NRA.Finally, I have one question: What happened to the Federal agents thathad supposedly infiltrated the Branch Davidians' organization (andstarted this whole debacle)?-------------------------------------------------------------------Rick Roy       Usenet: rick@howtek.MV.com       America Online: QEDDisclaimer: My employer's views are orthogonal to these.The early bird got worms.

There are people who convert fromnon-theism to theism after being brought up in a non-theist household.  (Idon't have any statistics as to how many though.  That would be aninteresting thing to know.)  I think that religion is a crutch.  People arenaturally afraid of the unknown and the unexplainable.  People don't wantto believe that when they die, they are dead, finished.  That there isnothing else after that.  And so religion is kind of a nice fantasy.Religion also describes things we don't know about the universe (thingsscience has not yet described) and it also gives people a feeling ofsecurity... that if they just do this one thing and everything will be ok.That they are being watched over by a higher power and its minions.  Thishas a very high psychological attraction for quite a few people and thesepeople are willing to put up with a few discrepancies and holes in theirbelief system for what it gains them.  This is why I think it's kind ofuseless to try too hard to convert theists to atheism.  They are happy withtheir fantasy and they feel that other people will be happy with it too(they can't accept the fact that there are people who would rather acceptthe harsh reality that they are running from).Anyway, I'm getting kind of carried away here.  But my point is that theismdoesn't have to be ingrained into a child's mindset for that person to growup as a theist (although this happens far too often).  Theism is designedto have its own attractions.> >     _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/       _/    * Atheist>    _/        _/    _/   _/ _/ _/ _/     * Libertarian>   _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/   _/  _/      * Pro-individuality>        _/  _/     _/  _/       _/       * Pro-responsibility> _/_/_/_/  _/      _/ _/       _/ Jr.    * and all that jazz...Nanci.........................................................................If you know (and are SURE of) the author of this quote, please send meemail (nm0w+@andrew.cmu.edu):If you are one in a million, then there are 7 and a half of you in NYC.

Stop! Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that the first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi party, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a redherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of the histories I've read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using homosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was thatHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuseofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your factsright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA ina coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations ofhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (itis possible that the histories I've read have not mentioned this, but I doubtit - would it be in Hitler's best interest to admit to the world that hisformer right hand man was a homosexual?). Anyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references to the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the night of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even the Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, this does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the 1920's.>Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,>anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered>tainted evidence. Ah, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell theparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with homosexuality (at least, not according to what I've read), I'd like to know what tainted "evidence" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made by persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those accusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the 1920's and 30's, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in time and plant "tainted" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers which were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being obvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matterdo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in these matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a false accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point here seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof falls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework before making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.>The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,>the SA -- Sturmabteilung, "Storm Troopers" -- left the world a better>place when they departed, This is just about the *only* thing we agree on. I suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and his SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feelingseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that thismust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is whatlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But thisis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If you really think that historians are so incompetent, why don't you write them and ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can't tell from their footnotes? I'm a graduate student in history. Writing to professors andtracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not myspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that wouldcast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I'm not going to waste my timetrying to debunk someone's paranoia. Do the research yourself.>but concrete particulars are still no more than>more or less shrewd guesses.  >-- Diccon FrankbornGiven that you already consider all evidence "tainted", what on earth wouldconstitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars beenconsidered "shrewd guesses"?I suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -historians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious footnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually provide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place to start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.I'll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already.

God being unknowable, I can't comment on His motives, but it would bedistressing if He allowed us to misunderstand Him through no fault of our own.  For sanity's sake we must assume, if we believe in Him at all,that His message comes through somehow.  The question is whether it comes through immediately to every individual, or is contained in a complex canon that must be interpreted by experts in consultation with one another, or is transmitted directly through appointed representatives who are freeto interpret, extend and modify the canon.  If God's message is indeedmediated, the further problem arises as to whether the individual under-stands the mediated message fully and clearly.  Since the responsibility for understanding lies ultimately with the individual, we must assume that God in His benevolence guides each individual to the appropriate source for that individual, whereof the person may or may not drink.  >>Metaphysically, if there are multiple moral codes then there is no>>Absolute moral code, and I think this is theologically questionable. >No. There may be an absolute moral code.

Incidentally, the young child considers the directive>as absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own. Your example is complicated in our age by the thin line between moralityand politeness.  You might have said "burp", for burping and swearing carryabout the same stigma today.  If you are talking about "taking the Lord's name in vain" as a serious transgression, then this example is more a case of hypocrisy than of varying moral codes. If there is an absolute moral code, propositions or laws in that code applyabsolutely and universally, by definition.  Conceivably some moral codescould be subsets of the universal code, as you say at the outset.  So, forexample, God's code could include, "Thou shalt not create Beings withouta hospitable planet to live on", but this law would be inapplicable to us.Nevertheless, we would be entitled to suppose that all laws applicableto us are also applicable to God. But when you begin to ask what laws might appear in God's moral code, you havea sense of the absurdity of the question.  Does God make laws for Himself tofollow?  Perhaps God is not the sort of being to which the category "morality"can be sensibly applied.--                                      James Owens  ad354@Freenet.carleton.ca                                     Ottawa, Ontario, Canada

I don't think this was the intentionof the original question, since you now define-out the word"real" so that nothing can meet its criteria.Just a thought.Brian /-|-\\PS  Rainbows and Shadows are "real": they are not objects, theyare phenomenon.  An interesting question would be if atomsare objects (classical) or phenomenon (neo-quantum) or what?

If Jesus>says "everyone", you cannot support that by referring to a group of people>somewhat smaller than "everyone".That's right.  Everyone.  Even infants who cannot speak as yet.  Evena little child will rebelliously stick his finger in a light socket.Even a little child will not want his diaper changed.  Even a littlechild will fight nap-time.So far as Jesus saying "everyone":      A certain ruler asked Jesus, "Good teacher, what must I do to    inherit eternal life?"    "Why do you call me good?"  Jesus answered.  "No one is good--    except God alone."Ken, the book of Romans states that we are born sinners.  We donot grow into being a sinner.  We sin because we are sinners.  Thecommon mistake, even in Christian circles, is to think the reversetrue.    So for as surely as you grew to look like you parents,you not only inherited their appearance, but also their sin nature.It goes with being human. Even though a new-born is innocent as can be, his sinful naturewill surely manifest itself more explicity as he gets older.  Foras surely as he grows hair on his head and teeth within his mouth,he will show the signs of his innate sin by rebellingagainst mommy and daddy with that loud proclamation "No."

The FBI andthe BATF could not let a man like that live.  He was a testimonial to theirstupidity and lies.    Now before everyone gets crazy with me, let me say that Koresh was crazy as a bed bug, but out government was crazier...and they lied to us.They told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time.  Yet, whoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and intotown on a regular basis.  Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and wondered why they didn't pick him up then.  There are two possible answers.First, they didn't see him.  What kind of survaillance is that?  Second, theydidn't care.  They wanted a confrontation.  They wanted publicity and they gotit.After the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they werecoming.  They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that.Well, we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway.Did they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige?  According tothem they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raisedKoresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                  The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper hesaid:"A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out.His grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh's Real name)  she didn't raiseDavid Koresh."Someone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on alogical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.Here's another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming thatthey feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something mustbe done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it?I knew they were going to do something when they started talking about howmuch money this was costing.  That was the start of the "Justification" partpart of the plan.  That's when I knew it would come soon.But, back to the plan.  It is considered "Cruel and Unusal Punishment" toexecute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what's acceptable.They knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were notsure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the compound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children weresupposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.I spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR(Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that trainingis going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children weresubjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical agent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.I have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind ofthing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.We waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave thesepeople 51 days.  I stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this wholething that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Rickschanged my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:"And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that theoperation had been at least a modified success because not a single federalshot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt."It took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.One more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automaticweapons on the premises.                                                               HE HAD A LICENSE FOR THE 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN!THEY KNEW DAMN WELL HE HAD ONE. THEY ALSO KNEW HE HAD IT LEGALLY!Still, without the element of surprise they sent in agents to get him.For all of this my President takes full responsibility.  What a guy!I hope he gets it.

Later he seems to have risen to chief prominence worshipped by the Persians. Associated with the Sun but NOT the Sun, he is the lord of contract honor and obedience, therefore naturally worshipped by soldiers. He was ordered by the Sun to slay the bull of heaven and He reluct- antly agreed because of His obligation...the blood of that bull spilled and grew all earth life...then Mitra and the Sun sat down to eat.Worship of Lord Mitra ended in Persia with the ascension of the Zoroastrians.Hundreds of years later He was rediscovered and thrown into the Official Roman Pantheon (tm) for some semi-tricky reason, I forget why. But all references of Him ended abruptly when He was stricken from same, so apparently His worship was some sort of vehicle for advancement in the bureaucracy, like membership in the Communist Party was in the Soviet Bloc. The sociology of religion in ancient times is fascinating!Oh, His B-day was 25 Dec. Ahem.I am not sure if the mystery cult really lasted after His was booted from the Roman Imperial God Roster or what. It contained mostly soldiers, with 7 levels of initiation. They worshipped underground in caverns in pews. The bull horns in those temples were for scaring away or impaling evil spirits, I'm not sure that they had Mithraic significance or not.I don't know that the ritual meal was of a cannibalistic nature as is the Christian masses. But eating deities goes way back to Old Kingdom Egypt.Someone mentioned bullfighting. Did Mithraists sacrifice bulls? I forget. More likely, for a religious source, might be the shower of bull's blood enjoyed by the worshippers of Cybele on the Day of Blood? Cybele worship extended all throughout even up to France bigtime.-------CHARLES HOPE   A54SI@CUNYVM   A54SI@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDUGOVERNMENT BY REPORTERS...MEDIA-OCRACY.

I will also leave it up to other LDS netters to  take Mr. Weiss to task on using Mormon Doctrine to declare the difinitive  word on what the LDS Church teaches as doctrine.  Hopefully the LDS   netters will be amiable in their explanation.)Since it would do no good to rebut what Mr. Weiss has stated on the originof the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspired (I say "no good"because it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not the authors of the Creed were inspired), I leave you (it will be some time before I post again) with the following thought authored by Eugene England, Professor of English at Brigham Young University.  Mr. England wrote the following as part of a book review section in This People's magazine (Spring 1993 edition):  "I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--  or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other   with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian   or non-Christian -- Hal 8^).  When we are tempted to draw a circle around  a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude  those who don't fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central  defining characteristic of a good American might be "one who doesn't draw  exclusive circles" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the   central American ideal is by excluding others.  And when we are tempted to  draw a circle around "Mormon" or "Christian," to decide who is "orthodox"  and who isn't by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider  that the central pillar of Christ's "orthodoxy" is our ability to love  unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.  "I recently spent some time in a "Christian" bookstore in California. The  service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and  well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural  commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons.  But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking   others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American  culture, or other religions.  A whole section was devoted to "Cults and the  Occult," and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same  rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism.  And I found  I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers  (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous  anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations  of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s).  "It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to  Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety ("Perfect  love casteth out fear," I John 4:18).  I have always been pleased that the  LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though I find a   disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the  same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive  action---as the "religious right wing" has launched this year against the  political left and American cultural and religious styles they don't like.  It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the  very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would,  if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons' rights along with those of  others they believe to be evil."The above "sermon" was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribeto This People's magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us whorely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into Hisarms.  Even though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles of the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ, the Church does not claim perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do now lead the Church.  I, for one, do not wish to be labelled "Christian", if those who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are intollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication than mainstream Christianity would give it.  Once again, being in the majority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective voice is louder.  That's really all the critics of the LDS Church have to standon in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter the LDS Church' interpretation!  Using someone elses biased research of truths and non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to disprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone, least of all themselves. Let us simply agree to disagree, and share beliefs through adult discussion and conversation, thereby uplifting everyone.   Hal Leifson -- signing off!

Says will exhault throne above the stars.>Daniel 10:12-14DAN 10:12  Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for  from thefirst  day  that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and tochasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard,  and  I amcome for thy words.DAN 10:13  But the prince of the kingdom of Persia  withstood me                    ------------------------------one  and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes,                                        ------------------------came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.DAN 10:14  Now I am come to make thee understand what  shall be-fall  thy  people  in  the latter days: for yet the vision is formany days.See who is being discussed?>Ezekiel 28:12-19EZE 28:12  Son of man, take up a lamentation  upon  the  king of                                                     -----------Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou sealest up-----the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.EZE 28:13  Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God;  every  pre-cious  stone  was  thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the dia-mond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the em-erald,  and  the  carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy ta-brets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that  thouwast created.EZE 28:14  Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I haveset  thee  so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hastwalked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.EZE 28:15  Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day  that  thouwast created, till iniquity was found in thee.EZE 28:16  By the multitude of thy merchandise they  have  filledthe  midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: thereforeI will cast thee as profane out of the mountain  of  God:  and  Iwill  destroy  thee,  O  covering  cherub,  from the midst of thestones of fire.EZE 28:17  Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty,  thouhast  corrupted  thy  wisdom  by reason of thy brightness: I willcast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that  theymay behold thee.EZE 28:18  Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude ofthine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore willI bring forth a fire from the midst  of  thee,  it  shall  devourthee,  and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sightof all them that behold thee.EZE 28:19  All they that know thee among the people shall be as-tonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou beany more.Anyone else to make a claim about the characteristics of the devil?

(Just as one should not be compelled to pay for lipposuctioncoverage if ONE doesn't WANT that kind of coverage).A full third of the country flatly considers abortion to be murderfor reasons of conscience.  If the first amendment means ANYTHING at allanymore, then these people should NOT be COMPELLED to PAY for "abortioncoverage" if it is so OBVIOUSLY offensive to their beliefs.  Or are wegoing to start forcing Jews to eat pork, Quakers to fight in wars, etc?No one should be COMPELLED to sign a defacto "loyalty oath" in support ofabortion in order to gain access to health care, ESPECIALLY if one'sconscience is so obviously against the practice (of abortion).dennisdzkriz@ocf.berkeley.eduPS Sure read through the two short form letters I posted at the beginningof this post.

Most normal adult human beings aregood examples of "people".  Most children over two years old are "people" aswell.  The simple way of determining this is that you can have a conversationwith them.  It is actually more complicated than that, but I have no desireto spend the time it would take to explain it to you.

Further, I think that it is logically necessary for the laws of our universe be confined to this universeitself.Why do I believe this? It is simple; I believe that the odds againstthere being only one universe and that universe having the right conditionsto support us are infinate. I believe that to explain our existance inthis universe it is necessary to either consider multiple universes(an infinate number of them) or intelligent design. Since the onlyintelligence that we know of is of a higher order than simple matter(the brain is made of matter) by Ockham's razor I go for the firstchoice.What's more, there are a couple of books out dealing with popularscience that use parallel universes and holographic universes (whichis another way of saying parallel) to explain the behavior of particalsat the quantum level. One is called Parallel Universes, and I think itis by Wolf, the other The Holographic Universe.BTW, the parallel universe approach implys an element of mind in thevery physical reality of the universe. >Bruce Salem>eric

Someones even made the statement that science is"subjective" and that even atom are "subjective." This is getting a bit sillyand the word "objective" is losing all meaning.  Lets start by remembering thedefinition of "objective" which has been already presented:  objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as     distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existence.    3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on    observable phenomenon.The Objectivity of a thing is not based on whether everyone agrees on thatthing (eg: the world is objectively round, regardless of the fact that thereexist flat earthers), but rather whether it is based observable and verifiablephenomenon (instead of being based solely on peoples wishes, feeling, mentalprocesses, etc).  Thus atoms, being based on very observable and repeatablephenomenon, are indeed considered to be objective rather than subjective. Even weird, high energy physics is based on observable phenomenon (even thoughthat observation can change the outcome).  Nor are those observable phenomenonaffected by emotion, or personal prejudice (eg: chemical reactions do notchange to the whims of different people).  Thus to say that science is notobjective (ie: objectively verifiable) is a bit silly, as that is thepoint of science.  Now I will agree that science is not objectively "good;" Iwill not thereby conclude though that science is not objective. Now some examples things which are "objective":  A D-12 tractor is largerthan the average breadbox.  Chlorophyll is green.  Seawater contains salt.There exists ozone in the atmosphere (at least presently).  Ozone blocks ultraviolet light.  Ultraviolet light increases the incidents of skin Cancer."Good" on the other hand is a value judgement.  It doesn't seem to have anexistence apart from what we give it (unless someone can objectively show theexistence of an omnipotent entity which has defined "good").  We cannotquantify it, touch it or collect it in any concrete sense (eg: I have a bagfull of "good").  Now we do sometimes attempt to give the word "good" anobjective meaning, e.g.  "good" has been used to denote strength, resiliency,speed, etc.  That though, is a subjective definition, as some might not see"strength" and etc, as necessarily "good" (eg: strength inspired by Naziism is not generally viewed as "good"). As to a morality, I cannot say that I have ever seen a morality strictly basedon verifiable observable phenomenon.  The closest I have seen is some form ofthe "Golden Rule," which concludes that it is best not to deliberately pisspeople off, as they will likely then involve themselves in your life, in amanner you won't like.  This is verifiable; when you "get in someone's face,"they will often retaliate.  Another objective fact about morality is that amore powerful group can enforce their morality on a weaker group, and thus canat times, ignore that form of the "Golden Rule" without fear of reprisal.  Nowas to whether this enforcing of morality is "good" or "bad," is quitesubjective.  By the way, remember that subjective does not mean that a thingcannot be formally stated, or even commonly agreed upon; it only means thatthat it is not verifiable from observable phenomena, or has a physicalexistence unto itself.  Also note that I have not stated that there is no suchthing as an objective morality, or that I could not accept any such amorality; I have simply stated that I have seen no evidence of any suchmorality. One other thing to notice, "objective" is many times used as synonymous with"true" and/or "absolute," and "subjective" sometimes has the connotation of"false" and/or "relative." Tain't necessarily so.  For instance, when aconclusion is based on objective, but insufficient evidence, then it can beboth objective and false.  As to "absolute," it is easy to note that while wecan objectively show that TNT is explosive, but that does not absolutely meanthat all TNT will explode, and thus objective is not necessarily absoluteeither.  On the other hand, something subjective can also be either"absolutist," or "true." For instance, there are some theists who arespecifically "absolutist" in their morality, even though they have onlysubjective evidence to back it up.  Further, many a scientist and detectivehas been motivated by subjective reasons (eg: a "gut feeling" or "hunch"), toinvestigate a phenomena or situation, and gather the objective evidencenecessary to support a true hypothesis.  On the whole though, I would have toagree that objective evidence is much more trustworthy than subjectiveevidence. Later,Dave Butler    In starting any thesis, it seems to me, one should put forward as one's    point of departure something incontrovertible; the expression should be    simple and dignified.Diogenes

You can e-mail your presents (he likes rawhide chewy toys) to            the address above.Date: Wed, 21 Apr 1993 03:40:23 GMTLines: 73There were some recent developments in the dispute about Masonry amongSouthern Baptists.  I posted a summary over in bit.listserv.christia, andI suppose that it might be useful here.  Note that I do not necessarilyagree or disagree with any of what follows: I present it as information. *For a short summary:  a Southern Baptist named Larry Holly wrote a bookclaiming that Freemasonry is a religion incompatible with Christianity.(Mr Holly's father rejects Christianity, and Mr Holly blames that on theMasons.)The SBC's Home Missions Board includes an interfaith witness department,which studies other religions and how to teach them about Christ.  A fewyears ago, they were ordered to produce a report on Masonry: they concludedthat it was not a religion, and therefore was outside their speciality.However, Mr Holly led a movement of people who oppose Masonry, andlast year the Convention again ordered the HMB to study Masonry.  (I got thefeeling that they were saying "You got the wrong answer last time, try todo better and get the answer we want.")Anyway, there's been a bit of infighting and some inappropriate actions, butthe dust has settled and the report is in.  Nobody is entirely happy with it,but everybody seems willing to live with it.  Both sides are saying thingssuch as: "This was the best we were going to get in the current environment."The report commends the Masons for the charity work they do, such as thehospitals and burn centers they operate, as well as efforts to help theelderly and prevent drug abuse.  The report acknowledges that many well-known Christians are and have been Masons, and notes that many teachingsof Masonry are "supportive of Christian faith and practice".  Examples ofthe latter include belief in God, emphases on honesty and integrity, andthat some Masonic lodges incorporate explicit Christian beliefs.On the other hand, they note that some aspects of Masonry are incompatiblewith Southern Baptist principles.  These included the use of titles which somepeople consider sacrilegious, the taking of certain oaths (even though theyare not meant seriously), the "undeniably pagan and/or occultic" writings ofsome Masonic leaders, the implication in some Masonic writings that salvationcan be achieved by good works, and the racial discrimination practiced by manyMasonic lodges.  (I note with some chagrin that Baptist churches as a wholearen't really in a place to speak on this last point.)The report concludes that Masonry is not a religion, and says that membershipshould not be endorsed or censured, but left to the discretion of individuals.This was in part because there is variation among different Masonic Lodges,and while one may include elements strongly against Christianity, another maynot.  Many Southern Baptists have strong convictions about the priesthood ofthe believer and the autonomy of the local church, and this history probablyinfluenced how the report came out. *The information above was gleaned from "The Religious Herald", a publicationof the Baptist General Association of Virginia, and "Baptists Today", whichdoes not have any direct links to a religious organisation.  (Autonomy is abig issue among some Baptists.  8-)Because I have neither the report itself, nor whatever Masonic documents arerelevant to these issues, none of the above comes with a guarantee.  Yourmileage may vary.

Science has its basis in observable fact. I'd say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation isinterpreted and what significance it's given depends a great deal onthe values of the observer. Science is a human activity and as such,is subject to the same potential for distortion as any other humanactivity. The myth that scientists are above moral influence orethical concern, that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and purefrom nature untainted by the biases of the scientist, is nonsense.Bill: If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must: first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering: the meaning of the word "objective" I doubt that this will ever happen.: So, back to the original question:: And objective morality is.....?This may be an unfortunate choice of words, almost self-contradictory.Objective in the sense used here means something immutable andabsolute while morality describes the behavior of some group ofpeople. The first term is all inclusive, the second is specific. Theconcept supposedly described may have meaning however. If there is a God as described by the Christians (for instance), thenHe has existence apart from and independent of humankind; Hisexistence is outside of our frame of reference (reality). If thisbeing declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He hasdefined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed,He is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsicallyself-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in anobjective sense.If God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective.If human beings are held accountable for their conformance to thatstandard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relativemorality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous,meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending tomisunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required tomeet that standard is therefore objectively determined.Just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality isinfinitely malleable, doesn't mean that the objective standard itselfdoesn't exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a culturalnorm, or the preferred conduct of "decent" people, making it seemsubjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard.Ironically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our truenature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as beingcontrary to human nre, oppressive and severe. This may be due asBillmuch to our amoral inclinations as to the standard itself, but like itor not, it's there.x

At   least one history I have read formed the opinion that they left for the   US not to practice religious freedom but to practice religious intolerance.Sigh, see what our school systems are producing?  Total confusion!The original English settlers were, probably, the most intolerant lotof people to ever assemble.  However, the Founding Fathers(Washington, Jefferson, Madison, etc.), practically made it theirlife's work to ensure that religious intolerance would not destroytheir great experiment... a democratic republic.I strongly suggest that those interested get some of Jefferson's andMadison's writings. Particularly good is Madison's "(something)andRemonstrance", [yea, I'm litterate and have functioning memory cells:-( ].  IMHO, Jefferson and Madison were the two greatest American'swho ever lived. Although both were products of their time (Jeffersonwas a slave owner), they were able to see more clearly than theircontemporaries, and for that matter, more clearly than most modernpoliticians. Their prose is the epitome of eloquence. I don't knowabout y'all, but reading the Declaration of Independence give memental goosebumps. (For those who have never read it, I am appending acopy of it.)--In CONGRESS, July 4, 1776The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America,When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for onepeople to dissolve the political bands which have connected them withanother, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate andequal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitlethem, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that theyshould declare the causes which impel them to the separation.We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are createdequal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienableRights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit ofHappiness.  That to secure these rights, Governments are institutedamong Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of thegoverned.  That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive ofthese ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it,and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on suchprinciples and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shallseem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.  Prudence,indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not bechanged for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experiencehath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils aresufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to whichthey are accustomed.  But when a long train of abuses and usurpations,pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce themunder absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, tothrow off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their futuresecurity.Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such isnow the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systemsof Government.  The history of the present King of Great Britain is ahistory of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in directobject the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.  Toprove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessaryfor the public good.He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressingimportance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent shouldbe obtained, and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attendto them.He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of largedistricts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right ofRepresentation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them andformidable to tyrants only.He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their publicRecords, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance withhis measures.He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing withmanly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to causeothers to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable ofAnnihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise;the State remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers ofinvasion from without, and convulsions within.He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for thatpurpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners;refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, andraising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing hisAssent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure oftheir offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms ofOfficers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies, without theconsent of our legislatures.He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior tothe Civil power.He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign toour constitution and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent totheir Acts of pretended Legislation:For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:For protecting them by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders    which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:For depriving us in many cases of the benefits of Trial by Jury:For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring    Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and    enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example    and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into    these Colonies:For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and    altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested    with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.He has abdicated Government here by declaring us out of his Protectionand waging War against us.He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, anddestroyed the lives of our people.He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries tocomplete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begunwith circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in themost barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilizednation.He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seasto bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners oftheir friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavouredto bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless IndianSavages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destructionof all ages, sexes and conditions.In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress inthe most humble terms.  Our repeated Petitions have been answered onlyby repeated injury.  A Prince, whose character is thus marked by everyact which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a freepeople.Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren.We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature    to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and    settlement here.We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity,    and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow    these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections    and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice     and of consanguinity.We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our    Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies     in War, in Peace Friends.We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, inGeneral Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of theworld for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by theauthority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish anddeclare.  That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to beFree and Independent States; that they are Absolved from allAllegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connectionbetween them and the State of Great Britain is and ought to be totallydissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have fullPower to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establishCommerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent Statesmay of right do.

The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain etymology. It may originally have meant "member of the tribe," as in theAvestan compound mogu-tbish ("hostile to a member of the tribe"). This meaningwould have been further resticted, among the Medes, to "member of the priestlytribe" and perhaps to "priest" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term isprobably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the "Magoi" as one ofthe six tribes of the Medes.  For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of apriestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they wereresponsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining theirknowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Medianpriesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Medianmonarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth centurythrough the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus theGreat (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their politicaland civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advancedconcerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period(Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This isdemonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned byDarius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as byGreek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power ofthe Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.  The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down thesacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude thepossibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to beattested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.  There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magiare members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members ofthe priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis isuntenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to theAvestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, "gift"), isnot without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found,in conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept ofpurity, or separation of the "mixture" of the two opposed principles of spiritand matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as "chorus," fromthe root mangh, which is said to mean "sing the magic song" (Nyberg, 1966) andhas been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be anecstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, thoughthere may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan termsmagavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and theAvestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despitea recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignorethe Avestan term for "priest," athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is perhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis (Gershevitch, 1964).  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; thePahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter inparticular derives from an older form, magupati ("head of the Magi"). Duringthe Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation ofa hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad ("the high priest ofhigh priests") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiasticalhierarchy.  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,khwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure ofthe corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.The corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demonsof putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastriancommunity and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among theParsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for thisrite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse wasin vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse withwax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoplesof Central Asia.  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible tooffer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of aritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly thecustodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about therelationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and wascalled upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were alsoknown for the practice of killing harmful, or "Ahrimanical," animals (khrafstra)such as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,tunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering offelt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the noseand mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with theirbreath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a traditionthat is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, wasthat of the priesthood: white.  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not inpossession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that theygradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting ofprofessional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturallyinclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have beenjealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of thisthey were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsiblefor teaching the prince the "magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes" and thusthe "cult of the gods." Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted withthe education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, andmaster of himself.  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of greatinfluence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despiteseveral dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death ofGaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himselfSmerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -the Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,in Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationedas a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They wererenowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some ofthe greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise menwho arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior inBethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they werealso known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;this was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,like "goes," "expert in the magic arts" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, theChaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, andhad a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, itis necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-calledwestern Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both musthave been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of theIranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came incontact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and invarying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on theirvarying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classicalhistorians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document theircustoms, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,belief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theologyand eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magieven speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what theMagi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adoptedZoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own andplaced themselves under his venerable name.  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in theeastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting thoseelements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quiteoften, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in theZoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, "the law-abjuringdaivas"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection oftexts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules andpractices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the firstchapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, thesupreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;Gathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source ofall evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (theland of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, ithas been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi theabsence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their ownpriesthood, would be very strange.  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and thecorpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of thefirst millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attributedirectly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known tous especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature ofthe ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two polesof the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu ("beneficentspirit") and Angra Mainyu ("hostile spirit") but Ahura Mazda himself and AngraMainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans-formation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-astrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with theMesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later knownto the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we cansee the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to whichwe give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormouslyimportant role in the transmission of Zarathushtra's treachings, as well as inthe definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Theirnatural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion ofZoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks beganto study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia,Hermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatiseson the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments havesurvived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school ofwisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authorityof such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming anabundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).  Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meetingground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous_Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and whichmost likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably thesecond century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior ofthe Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magito Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]  The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in thereligious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce,1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion ofIran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able toestablish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with anorthodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figuresin the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosarand Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.SAOSHYANT:  The Avestan term saoshyant ("future benefactor"; MPers., soshans) designatesthe savior of the world, who will arrive at a future time to redeem humankind.The concept of the future savior is one of the fundamental notions of Zoro-astrianism, together with that of dualism; it appears as early as in the Gathas.Zarathushtra (Zoroaster), as the prophet of the religion, is himself a Sao-shyant, one who performs his works for the Frashokereti, the end of the presentstate of the world, when existence will be "rehabilitated" and "made splendid."[See Frashokereti]  Later Zoroastrian doctrine developed this notion into a true eschatologicalmyth and expanded the number of Saoshyants from one to three. All the saviorsare born from the seed of Zarathushtra, which is preserved through the ages inLake Kansaoya (identified with present-day Lake Helmand, in Seistan, Iran),protected by 99,999 fravashis, or guardian spirits. The greatest of the awaitedSaoshyants, the victorious Astvatereta ("he who embodies truth"), the son ofthe Vispataurvairi ("she who conquers all"), is the third, who will makeexistence splendid; he appears in Yashts 19. Upon his arrival humankind willno longer be subject to old age, death, or corruption, and will be grantedunlimited power. At that time the dead will be resurrected, and the living willbe immortal and indestructable. Brandishing the weapon with which he kills thepowerful enemies of the world of truth (that is, the world of the spirit, andof asha), Astvatereta will look upon the whole of corporeal existence andrender it imperishable. He and his comrades will engage in a great battle withthe forces of evil, which will be destroyed.  The name Astvatereta is clearly the result of theological speculation(Kellens, 1974), as are those of his two brothers, Ukhshyatereta, "he who makestruth grow," and Ukhshyatnemah, "he who makes reverence grow"; the names of thethree virgins (Yashts 13) who are impregnated with the seed of Zarathushtrawhen they bathe in Lake Kansaoya and give birth to the Saoshyants, are equallyspeculative. Each of these Saoshyants will arrive at the beginning of amillennium, initiating a new age and a new cycle of existence; Astvatereta willappear in the third and final millennium to save mankind.  The doctrine of the future savior had already taken shape in the Archaemenidperiod (sixth to fourth century BCE). It was not, perhaps the principal elementin the formation of the messianic idea, but it was certainly a determiningfactor, one that enjoyed great success in the Hellenistic period beyond theconfines of the Iranian world. A similar concept, that of the future Buddha,Maitreya, was most likely indebted to it, and Christian messianism can traceits roots to the same source.

Those who have been inside burninghouses know that if they want to stay alive, it's better to run outfrom the building. We had one case where an FBI agent *had to drag out a women* from the burning house, she run back in whenshe saw the forces arriving.

Why should I assert anything about beings that I don't believe in?When I have no good idea of what this being is like, only some contradictory statements being made by various religions, I cannot firmly assert anything specific. A mathematical atheist has a proof that no godlike beings can exist.However, we will first need a definition of 'god', and the theisticreligions do not agree very well on this. Did you see my earlierposting on the existence of god? Theists cannot even agree whetherany god exists, or meta-exists, or is herself the existence. Omnipotence, omnibenevolence and omniscience are other conceptstheists do not all agree upon. Thus, it is hard to assert anythingabout a such fluxional beings. _Deus absconditus_ remains hidden,from those who believe and from those who don't. > That's where weak atheism draws its strength.

IMO, of course.I have to disagree here - first, philosophical maxims are not necessarilysomething to build upon. What can I build upon Occam's Razor, for instance? Weak atheism is not a _philosophy_ (a philosophical system).There are several alternatives from which atheists may choose from,ranging from reductionism (my choice) to objectivism. Actually,philosophy becomes simpler without the additional assumption of god/s.Second, your claim that being without assertions is an Achilles'heel of weak atheism sounds strange to me, and is actually a versionof the oft-heard theistic claim that 'but even atheists have to place theirfaith on _something_, even if it is not god_'. This has been discussed inthe FAQ, but from a different viewpoint, and I do not repeat it.I think one does not have to take _anything_ on blind faith.True, one cannot prove that reality exists independent of the observer;to assume this is not a blind leap of faith at all, however. It isprobably the simplest assumption one can make (after solipsism,of course).  Petri-- ___. .'*''.*        Petri Pihko    kem-pmp@          Mathematics is the Truth.!___.'* '.'*' ' .

(John 8:38)          Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not           born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.  Jesus said           unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I           proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he           sent me.  Why do ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye           cannot hear my word.  Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the           lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the           beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in           him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a           liar, and the father of it. (John 8:41-44)          And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, [thou] child of           the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease           to pervert the right ways of the Lord? (Acts 13:10)          Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this           world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit           that now worketh in the children of disobedience: (Ephesians 2:2)          In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the           devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he           that loveth not his brother. (1 John 3:10)     One becomes a child of God...          But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the          sons of God, [even] to them that believe on his name: (John 1:12)          Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that          we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us          not, because it knew him not.  Beloved, now are we the sons of God,          and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when          he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he          is. (1 John 3:1-2)     ...when he is born again through faith in Jesus Christ:          Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of          the will of man, but of God. (John 1:13)          Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus          Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,          (Ephesians 1:5)          Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should          be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. (James 1:18)          For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of          God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;          but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,          Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we          are the children of God: (Romans 8:14-16)          Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one          that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. (1 John 4:7)          Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and          every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is          begotten of him.

The fact that some groups try to read      something into the Bible, doesn't change what the Bible teaches. For      example, the fact that the Jehovah's Witnesses deny the Deity of Christ      does not alter what the Bible teaches [ "Looking for that blessed hope,     and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus     Christ;" (Titus 2:13),"Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus     Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through     the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:" (2 Peter 1:1)]      on the Deity of Christ.     We first look to the Bible to see what it teaches. To discount, or not      even address, what the Bible teaches because there are some groups that      have differing views is self-defeating. To see what the Bible teaches,      you have to look at the Bible.ra> >     "Our Lord's mortality was essential to his own salvation" (_Thera> >     Promised Messiah_, p. 456), "He had to work out his own salvation byra> >     doing the will of the Father in all things" (ibid., p.54), "he hadra> >     to be baptized to gain admission to the celestial kingdom" (_Mormonra> >     Doctrine_, p.71).ra>ra>    Welcome to the wonderful world of Mormon paradoctrine, Robert.

Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of     Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' I don't     think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon. That is not the     issue.  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this     subject is the real issue.

The issuance of tear gas might have not beenthe best idea to achieve the extrication of the Branch Davidians, butprevious attempts through negotiation had fallen through and the FBI had said that this was to end asap.One person and one person ONLY is to blame for this. Vernon Howell aka David Koresh. It was he who issued the order to start shooting at the BATF agents when they went to serve the arrest warrant on Feb 28. It was the Davidians who KILLED four law enforcement agents, and injured several others. It was Koresh who refused to peacefully walk out of the compound and fight out the legalities in a court of law, with a jury of 11 citizens. (note: I can't saya jury of his peers, as his writings indicate that he thought that he was Jesus. It would be pretty difficult to find that many self-appointed prophets in the North Texas area.)As for who started the fires in the building, there have been numerous localnews reports with interviews with some of the rescued people stating in facttheir own people were starting the fires.  Once again, it wasn't Reno, or Clinton who lit the matches in this. It was Vernon Howell. The only people in the building I feel sorry for are the children who perished in the blaze,as they had no choice in the matter.

An awful lot of thestarvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economicpolicies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typicalWesterner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terriblemalnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it canbe fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  Theyhave to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loanswe encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarreidea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got.Perhaps it's more accurate to say that there's a Western ethic againstWestern infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the childrenare dying in the Third World, we couldn't give a shit.  And that goes for thesupposed "Pro-Life" movement, too.  They could save far more lives byfighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting againstabortion.  Hell, if they're only interested in fetuses, they could save moreof those by fighting for human rights in China.And besides, Suzanne's answer implies that non-Western countries lack thisethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatoryforced abortion in Tibet, I don't believe this to be the case.mathew

Butthey don't.  Evolution of life over a very long period of time is afact, if we are to believe evidence gathered during the last twocenturies from geology, paleontology, molecular biology and many otherscientific disciplines.

But it would clarify further if you would answer> from the point of view of any disinterested observers - perhaps an> observer as likely to be in position A as in position B (where A and B> disagree) in the future, and have his or her conclusion now binding on> them at that time.Well, if our observer X is as likely to be in A's position as B's, and if heagrees that both A and B are making appropriate observations and inferencesregarding the situation, then I would expect him to conclude that there is noright answer.  Hopefully there would be some other factor which would allowhim to make some judgement regarding which answer to accept.If, on the other hand, he disagrees with the principles of either A or B, Isuspect he would make a decision in favour of the other one.It is unfortunately the case that not all moral arguments have answers fromall perspectives.  For instance, I am completely unable to come to anyconclusion regarding whether abortion should be allowed or not, from myperspective.  In an ideal world, all living things would have a right tolife; but in an ideal world, women would have the absolute right to do whatthey like with their own bodies.  Clearly there is no way to resolve infavour of both these principles.  Therefore I agree with the compromisesolution of allowing abortion up to a certain time after conception, anddeciding on the time based on various (sometimes ill-defined) criteria.  Thisis also a sensible move, I think, because it lets people make their owndecisions (within reason).  And for what it's worth, I am reasonably happywith current UK abortion law.Similarly, the situation in what's left of Yugoslavia is a horrible mess, andI really can't see my way to any sort of conclusion.  There, I don't evenknow enough to imagine what sort of compromise one might manage.mathew

The problem with this andother arguments assumes that the burden of proof lies with the atheist. Wrong!In philosophy the one who is making a positive argument must give reasons forhis believing so, not the negative.  If I were to make the statement elves exist, then it would be up to me to prove my positive assertion, not the person saying that elves don't exist.  If the negative in this case had to prove elves don't exist he would have to omniscient and know every inch of theuniverse.  The same applies with god.

(follow-up)Message-ID: <m0njM7J-0000GwC@juts.ccc.amdahl.com>Date: 15 Apr 93 05:02:13 GMTSender: unknown@uts.amdahl.comLines: 53Return-Path: <amail.amdahl.com!rich.bellacera@juts.ccc.amdahl.com>I would like to apologize for the typos in the previous post.In retrospect I would also like to quote another source: Douglas C.Haldeman from his 1991 book _Homosexuality_THERAPY INEFFECTIVERecently the founders of yet another prominent "ex-gay" ministry, ExodusInternational, denounced their conversion therapy procedures as ineffective.Michael Busse and Gary Cooper, cofounders of Exodus International and loversfor 13 years, were involved with the organization from 1976 to 1979.  Theprogram was described by these men as "ineffective . . . not one person washealed."  They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominentfeelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many weredriven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed "reparative therapy."The previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE, June30, 1992 called "The Ex-Ex-Gay" by Robert Pela.Some personal thoughts:It is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a majorportion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority amongits ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only allthey required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, tosave their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Evenlater, the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression andsegragation of African-Americans, even to the justification of lynchings.Today's scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool isstill coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mindcontrol, convincing people that they should see themselves as less thanGod sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is feltthier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure, no one is "physically" forcedto stay in this "reparative therapy" but sheer social pressure is enough formany to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.As an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecutionagainst gays in all facets of civil life.  A person should be judged bythe contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live,not by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven';ta clue what is in their heart.For those who seek more information about Gays and groups that accept themplease contact your nearest chapter of PFLAG (Parents & Friends of LesbiansAnd Gays) who will be more than happy to assist you.  This is a group ofpeople comprised of Gays, Lesbians and Bisexuals, their parents and friendswho have formed a support group for help and understanding.  Try talking toa parent of a gay son or daughter and learn some "first-hand" real life andloving understanding.  God's love and understanding for Gay people is noless abundant.Thank you.PAX

(yeah right)  In order for *you* to "not pay for anyabortions" through your tax money, *everyone* would have to "not pay forany abortions" through tax money.  If this is the case, then women whohave reasons for "needing" an abortion, but are unable to afford it ontheir own, are just "out of luck".  Their *choice* is blocked because ofecononmic hardship--which is part of why they might "need" the abortionin the first place--and because *some* people don't want to "pay for anyabortions".  On top of that, there is the assumed requirement that thegovernemnt pay the delivery costs for those women who can't afford it,which will also include all of those women who could not afford an abortion.This involves *more money*.Suppose instead there *is* government funding of abortions for women whodesire them but can not afford one on their own.  Those who do not wantan abortion will have the costs of their delivery covered (if they cannot afford it on their own), and those who *do* want an abortion will beable to get one and *save the government money* in the process.  How thenare you "paying for" an abortion?  Rather that abortion is "paid for" bythe cost of *delivery* that it *saves* (and then some), and all becausewe remove the restriction against funding of a perfectly legal procedure.(Notice that this does not apply to cosmetic surgery, which is often usedas an example of "elective surgery" that is not generally paid for justbecause it is desired and can not be afforded.)If you insist on complaining about "paying for" someone's choice to havean abortion when they can't afford it, I will complain about "paying for"the larger costs of *restricting* that choice when they can not afford it.Why should you pay for someone else's choice?  Why should I pay more to*restrict* someone's choice?>(a bunch of other stuff deleted - not related to me :) )>>>>A pro-choice majority would not be enough for one of the two pro-choice>>candidates to win, however a pro-life majority *should* have been enough>>for the only pro-life candidate to win.

It would be awfully nice if reputable poll institutions would have a *clear*,unbiased poll on the issues of abortion.  In order to be unbiased there wouldhave to be allowance made for "shades of grey", rather than lump all of themiddle with one side by tricky wording--such as on the last poll I heardabout.

I took me a long time to cometo the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a"rosicrucian" body and BEING *a* ROSICRUCIAN. So when you say that you metsome 'rosicrucians' you mean "members of a group that calls themselvesrosicrucian". At least that is what your observation suggests :-)Response:This makes much sense to me.  This is also true of most religions.There is a difference between being a *member* of a group of peoplewho call themselves 'Hindus' or 'Christians' or 'Pagans' and actually*BEING* any of these.  The social groups tend to make very importantrequirements about not belonging to other 'religions'.  I find thatthe ideal described by the holy texts of most religions can beinterpreted in very similar ways so that one could presume that'mysticism' is the core of every religion and Huxley's 'PerennialPhilosophy' is the Great Secret Core of all mystical trads. :>Tony:I'd prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the LectoriumRosicrucianum, only because they may be confused, by some readers of thisnewsgroup, with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based (the USA Jurisdiction) inSan Jose, CA; this being the RC org with the most members (last time Ilooked). Of course, "most members" does not *necessarily* mean "best".Response:Certainly true.  I didn't know there WERE any groups which called themselves'Rosicrucians' that didn't associate with AMORC.  Sure, I've heard all thehubbub about the Golden Dawn and Rosae Crucis in relation to all theseWestern esoteric groups, but hadn't heard about other 'Rosicrucians'.I'll admit my bias.  I live in San Jose. :>Tony:"You'll have to trust me" when I tell you that if thatlecture/class/whatever had been presented by AMORC, it is unlikely that youwould have had the same impression, i.e., you'd probably have had apositive impression more likely than a negative one, IMHO. Response:This may be slightly off.  I've met some of these Rosicrucians and havea couple friends in AMORC.  The stories I've heard and the slight contactI've had with them does not give me the hope that I'd be received withany kind of warm welcome.  I still like to think that most people whoare involved with stratified relationships (monogamy, religion, etc.)are in DEEP pain and hope to heal it within such a 'cast'.Tony:     It is curious to know that 3 other RC 'orders' (in the USA) claim to be *non-sectarian*.Response:I'd like to know at least the addresses of the 'other orders' which call themselves 'Rosicrucians' and especially those which are 'nonsectarian'.Is this 'nonsectarian' like the Masons, who require that a member 'believein God by his/her definition'?          Tony:I don't see nothing *fundamentally* wrong with "us containingsomething divine"...

All you have done is>put doubt on who started the fire without providing any evidence to back>up your claim that the FBI was responsible.In my opinion, it is possible that the actions of the FBI: a) indirectly,b) directly but not intentionally, or c) intentionally (I hope not thelatter, but we would be naive to discount this possibility entirely) causedthe fire. It is possible that someone inside the community startedthe fire because they "thought" God told them to or because they simplywould rather die than surrender. Who knows? We are left with some compelling questions here, besides the above. Whyhaven't the droves of news reporters commented on whether or not theyheard shots coming from within the compound once the tank (I don'tremember its technical name) started ramming down the door? It seemsto me that gunshots would be audible at 2.5 to 3 miles away.Why couldn't the FBI wait until Koresh wrote his manuscript, as theyhad promised they would. Does the fact that Koresh lied justify theFBI's lying as well?Will an "internal investigation" really reveal what happened, if in factthe BATF and FBI are at least partly to blame?How will we ever know if Koresh broke the law as was alleged in thenow-unsealed (finally!) warrant? Certainly we won't find out in acourt of law.There's been a lot of talk about why the people didn't run out whenthe fire started, but one survivor said that the tank had collapsed thestairway and entryway and that the majority of the people were trapped.Only those in another part of the house escaped.People have commented on the unwillingness of the woman who came runningout of the house with her clothes ablaze to remain outside rather thangoing back in. When was the last time you had your clothes on fire? Who the heck knows if you'd know which way you were running and why? I thinkthe FBI agent who grabbed her and pulled her to safety acted heroically, btw. I'm certainly not trying to paint a picture of the "evil feds" by any means.

When studied witha>knowledge of cult psychology, Acts is eerily familiar, especially today.1. The mother church did disappear at the time of the Roman attack. Jamesthe Just was judicially murdered a few years earlier, but there isevidence that the church survived him. There is no evidence that it stillexisted after the assault on the city. The individuals historicallyassociated with that church disappear at that time. 2. The followers of Jesus included a number of individuals whose nicknamessuggested connections with the Jewish terrorism of the time (Zealotes,Iscariot, "Sons of Thunder").3. For cult psychology, there's an extensive literature.4. For an understanding of the motivation of the members of the Jerusalemchurch, there is a mixed collection of sources. The Anchor Bible has someinteresting articles, but one thing I've noticed about biblicalscholarship is that intellectual honesty and a skeptical approach arenotably lacking. You basically have to spread your net wide and thenwinnow. (For example, Allegro and Schoenfeld have some interesting ideas,but they were both "over the top.") Many interesting ideas have not beenfollowed up, mostly due to religious reasons. What was the connection ofearly Christian theology to Samaritan dualism and proto-gnosticism? (SeeStephen's speech in Acts for a Samaritan interpretation of thecrucifixion.) Schweitzer's interpretation of Jesus's motivations could beupdated, especially now that we have the Essene and Chenoboskianmaterials. And so it goes. (For instance, the convincing statisticalevidence concerning the authorship of the Pauline materials has beencompletely ignored by biblical scholars.)I don't track this area much any more. (My coursework is 20 years old.) Ihave a personal theory that the synoptics were written in Syria during thecourse of the Jewish Revolt. I suspect Mark was written before the fall ofJerusalem as an apology to get the Romans and Roman-sympathizers off theback of the local Greek Christians. Matthew and Luke were written withsimilar goals, but incorporating additional materials. Given the evidencein the Gospel of Thomas (Chenoboskien), I suspect Q came from a Samaritan(proto-gnostic) milieu. In any case, they were written in an environmentcut off by time or circumstances from Jerusalem, not expecting furthercontact, and not wanting to be connected by outsiders to the themes of thedoctrines held by the Jerusalem church.Sorry about the lack of documentation, but the time is hard to find.-- Harry ErwinInternet: erwin@trwacs.fp.trw.comHave found some interesting work...

Good andevil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.The Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation ofbeing. The warring opposites within us are a product of man'srebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages ofthe Scriptures.Man was created with the order to become a god. Those were the wordsof St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say wasthat God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In theEastern Orthodox Church, this is called "theosis," or "deification."One can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul,and body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a pictureof the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirswas a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and theCreator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God,their natural wholeness falling apart into two seeminglyirreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested intheir lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  Thisis symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.The beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If itwere to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil,its paradisiac state would also be destroyed.Was it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state ofinnocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gainingof self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that Hismasterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?God must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moralvalue, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. Thereis no other way to achieve union with God.Jesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities.He was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites,and making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God,not in His essence, but in His energies.The opposites is THE Christian problem. The Apostle Paul describes itwith the utmost precision in Romans 7:15-24. And he follows with theanswer to his dilemma in vs 25.                                 Mark

It's similar to collecting coins,or stamps, or campaign buttons, or coke bottles, or juke boxes, or modeltrains, or just about anything else that is collected (and just abouteverything is collected).  In all cases, you might consider it somethingof an aberration; I mean, what purpose does it serve?  Not much really;it's just a hobby.  The collector yearns for diversity (not much use inhaving TWO of the same thing, except for trading/selling it), historicalsignificance (this was the thingy used by so-and-so), technical significance(this is the only one that does such-and-such like this; this is the firstone to do it this way), rarity, and so on.Some people use their collections, other people do not.  As you state, youuse your collection.  In one sense, this diminishes the value of yourcollection as the items suffer wear and exposure.  In another sense, itcan enhance your own enjoyment of your collection.  Some people collectfirearms that they do not use; other people use some or all of the firearmsthey collect.  It's just personal preference.Oops, 'personal preference' ... I guess we're not supposed to have that anymore, are we?J.Baker.

What fireman should have to deal with a blaze like thatAND get shot at at the same time.These people were breaking the law.  I agree these weren't the best tactics,they probably should have backed off, pulled the perimeter way back, and letthem sit there with no media attention until they decided to come out.  The only other alternative I see would have been to send in a couple of specialforces guys to capture or assassinate Koresh.  But remember, these fruit-loops were putting their lives on the lines voluntarily.  Why should law-abiding citizens have to put themselves in any more danger than necessarywhen dealing with a nut?  Look at the man who jumped out of his Bradley tograb a flaming women who was running back into the building.  Yeah, I wouldhave to say they were trying to save those people.  I don't think I would risk my life that much to save someone that stupid that obviously didn'teven want to be saved.-Tim

With the flames go the prayers of about 1,200 Bay Area Zoroastrians thattheir faith will survive this land.   "There is a fear - a real fear, too," said Silloo Tarapore of Lafayette."We have one generation to do it or to die."   Many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land.But for Zoroastrians, it is an especially poignant concern.   Their religion has been around for perhaps 3,700 years, a heritage so deepit scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where "historical sites" aresometimes less than 100 years old.  It was the religion of the great PersianEmpire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christwas born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from threeZoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians,Jews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, theZoroastrian prophet.   Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are a miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as apeople is very much on their minds.   Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited toleranceof the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followedby nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: causetheir young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.   Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and theyactually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their childrenbecome totally assimilated, they say, it's their children - rather thanthe world at large - who will be the losers.   "It's important to have an identity," said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose,a leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  "It's importantfor everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life.You don't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect.You can fall back on your own identity."   For Zoroastrians, there's much to be proud of.   Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in whichanimal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there wasonly one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, whichtranslates as Lord of Wisdom and Light._Good vs. evil_   Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, withthe good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle forgood, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequencessuch as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity,kindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality ofmen and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.   But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not tofollow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact,Joseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths,traced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.   Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into astained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes ofMount Hamilton, is "Good thoughts, good words, good deeds."   So it's not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India,where a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escapepersecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy;the overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.   About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from Indiaand Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled fromIran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic statewhere others had no rights.   Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on "gooddeeds" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose,the recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about becauseManou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-updowntown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple'sdedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, theZoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.   The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by anIranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six templesin North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on MountHamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto,and Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples onthis continent.   Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and theproperty already had a large house that they have converted to acommunity center.   The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet Zoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted ceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.   Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed-in area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are sometimes called "fire worshippers," they actually consider fire just a symbol of God.  "It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the cross and Muslims use the Holy Book," Bhujwala said.   The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For allIranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day ofthe season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  WithZoroaster's birthday just six days later, the combination of religiousand secular holidays creates something on par with what most of theUnited States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.  For this year's celebration of the prophet's birthday, about 500 peoplecame to worship and revel.   "The good things in life are not forbidden," Esfandiar Anoushiravani,a leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followedproved him right.   Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stoodaround the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chantedthanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smokingsandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruitand nuts.   Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  "People eat thefruit," Tarapore said.  "It's a way to participate in the ceremony."_Santa Claus, sort of_   The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.  With flowing whitehair and a bag of gifts for the children, this Amownaroz wore greensymbolic of spring) and red.   He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, Hajefyrouz, who danced andplayed a tambourine.   The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.  "This is all new for us, too,"one told a visitor who asked what was going on.   A visitor, John A. Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued withthe religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians haveno procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of theircenturies of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hinduking who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with hispeople's religion.   But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at theSan Jose temple whenever he can.   "When I first heard about this religion," he said, "I thought, my God,this is what a religion should be.  They think for themselves and do good.   "People who don't have a tradition, something to lean on, what's thedifference with the lower animals?"------------------------------------------------ end of article ----

I'm sure FBI and BATF didn't *deliberately* start a possiblefire, having a sniper kill Korresh would have been a far easier method. Looking at the careful operation, and use of tear gasthat as I know don't start fires, it is less likely that this was the case.Sorry, but my bets are on fanatical people keen to startArmageddon -- theirs.Cheers,Kent---sandvik@newton.apple.com.

It isn't so much a matter of 'interpretation' of Bible texts that sets Mormonism apart from orthodoxy as it is a matter of *fabrication*.About 20 years ago, _National Lampoon_ had some comic strips in them that were drawn by Neal Adams. They were called "Son o' God" comics. It was a parody of the Jesus in the Bible. In the comic, there were a group of thirteen Jewish kids from Brooklyn, and when one of them said the magic word, he turned into "Son o' God." He went from a myopic, curly headed, yarmulke wearing boy to a replica of the stylizied portraits of Jesus --- with long flowing brown hair and gentile features.Now, if someone were to profess faith in this NatLamp Jesus, and claim that they were a Christian because they believed in this NatLamp Jesus, we would have to say that this was fallacious since this Jesus was a fabrication, and did not really exist.This is the exact same thing that the LDS do when they claim that they are Christian. They profess faith in Jesus, but the Jesus that they profess to have faith in is as much a fabrication as the NatLamp Jesus was.=============================Robert Weisspsyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu

There is no hiddenagenda behind this, so stop trying to look for one.   It is aneasy and as straight forward as it reads.Kent, I am not accusing you of evil things.  Jesus is accusing you.And it is not only you that He is accusing.  He is accusing everyone.Me, you and everyone in the world is guilty.  Whether onesees the light or does not seen the light has nothing to do with whether we do evil things.  We do them regardless.  Jesus uses the word "men".  I am included.  Jesus is not soloing you out.Jesus is making a general statement about out the sad state of man.Christians are not immuned from doing evil things.  A Christian is just a person in whom the Holy Spirit indwells.  A Christian can see the evil he is doing--because his evil has been broughtout into the light.  Jesus is not saying that just because evil has beenexposed, that the Christian will stop doing evil.  If you haven'tseen Jesus's light, your evil deeds simply haven't beenexposed to the His light.  You may shed some light on yourown.  Your human spirit shines at perhaps 1 candela.  But theHoly Spirit shines at a Megacandela.  The Holy Spirit canshine light into places inside us where we didn't even knowexisted. So do you see Jesus's point?  Christians are not perfect.  Nonchristiansare not perfect.  Nonchristians do not want to come into theLight of Jesus because they will see all the problems in their lives,and they will not like the sight.  It is an ugly thing to see how farwe have fallen from Jesus's perspective.  Do you think you want toknow how really ignorant you are?  Do you think Brian Kendig wantsto know?  Do you think I want to know?  Ego verses the truth,which do you choose?>I'm watching the news about a man who saw the light, and made>sure that the 19 children burned to death as part of his insight>into the light. I don't think the world is that simple. And if >you act in such ways when you are enlighted, then I'm a happy>man and I pray I will never receive such 'light'.And I watched Koresh too, an imposter who thought he saw the light, who made sure that the 19 children burned to death, sadly, as partof his delusion.  It is even sadder that the people whodied with him chose to die with them, and that ignorance wastheir downfall to death. And Kent, don't you bury yourself underneath a rock with anexcuse like bringing up Koresh--as if Koresh actually had truth in him.David Koresh was no light and no excuse foryou to stay away from the real Jesus Christ.  David Koresh, whoclaimed to be Jesus, was a fraud.  It was obvious.  David Koreshwas born in America. Jesus was born in Bethlehem.  Koresh wasn'teven a good imposter having missed an obvious point as that.Jesus warned of such imposters in the end-times.  DavidKoresh wasn't anything new to Jesus.  Jesus told us to beaware of imposters 2000 years ago.  So the next time an imposter makes a scene and claims tobe Jesus.  Ask the obvious.  Where were you born?  Was yourmother's name Mary?  If the Branch Davidians asked thatsimple question, they would have labeled Koresh a liarright from the start.  The wouldn't have followed Koresh.They wouldn't have died.  But look what happened.  Theirignorance cost them their lives.  Their choice to be ignorantcost them a lot.Kent, since you studied the Bible under Lutheranism, do younot remember what tactic Satan used to try to tempt Jesus?  Did not Satan quote the Bible out of context?  Do youremember what tactic the serpent of Genesis used to temptEve?  Did he not misquote God?  What Satan used on Eve and succeeded, was the same ploy he tried on Jesus.  But in Jesus's case,Jesus rebuked Satan back with the Bible _in_ context.  Itdidn't work with Jesus.  Does what Satan did to Eve in the Garden and what Satantried to do with Jesus in the desert remind you of whatKoresh did to his followers?  Who did Koresh emulate?Who was Koresh's teacher?  Koresh did to his followers whatSatan did to Eve.  Did not Koresh kill his followersr?  Didnot Satan cause Adam and Eve to die as well?  Did notthe cult followers believe Koresh even though they knewthe real Christ was born in Bethlehem?   Did not Evechoose to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good andevil despite knowing that it would cause her death?  Godheld them all responsible--deceiver and the rebeller.  None of them had an excuse.  As opposed to the Branch Davidians, we have a second chance.Follow Jesus and he will escort us to the path of eternal life.Don't follow Jesus, and you stand condemned already, for likethe Branch Davidian complex, your house is already on fire.Satan, Adam and Eve have already set it ablaze.   It is justa slow burn, but it is burning nevertheless.

The factof evolution is that the current diversity of life arose throughcommon descent:  this is so supported by the evidence that no one everbothers to try to test it anymore.  Theories of evolution includetheories regarding the mechanism of common descent (natural selectionvs. drift) or the actual "pathways" of evolution, or any number ofother things.  These are constantly being tested, because the actualmechanisms, etc, behind the fact of common descent are still up forquestion.Note that the fact of evolution is still a theory.  In other words, itcould, theoretically, still be falsified and rejected.  But since it'sso predictive, and so consistently supported by evidence, it seemspointless to explicitly try to falsify it anymore.[description of atomic theory, and alternative theories of gravity, deleted]>Both are very useful models that >have no religious overtones or requirements of faith, unless of course you >want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly >the way the theory now formulated talks about it.Here is where you fail to make an important distinction.

They still arm themselves to "defend thefaith", and stockpile food as well.  They have been involved in quite alot of illegal activity - including multiple (and often underage) wivesfor the leaders - a practice still in vogue with some splinters of theirsect.  The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking.So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J. Edgar Hoover was veryimpressed with the way they kept secrets.  (They're pledged to defendsecrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood.  Many actuallydo - even to the point of suicide.)  So he hired virtually no one butMormons, until the FBI was almost exclusively staffed by members of theChurch of Later Day Saints.  Though J. Edgar is finally gone, the FBIpersonnel (especially the field agents) are still heavily Mormon.I have often wondered how this might affect the FBI's treatmentof religious organizations a Mormon would consider heretical.-- ==========Michael McClarymcclary@netcom.comFor faster response, address electronic mail to:michael@node.com

There have been a number of posts defendingthe BD's as some persecuted religous minority, which is sheer bunk.Maybe the press and certain spokespeople bandied about the term "cult", etc.,but that is peripheral to the reasons for the initial assault and standoff.It was a weapons raid.  The feds couldn't give a hoot about the BD's religion, but any group that ILLEGALLY obtains and stockpiles automatic weapons is a threat.  This goes for neo-Nazis and other non-religous groups.So I have this question: If your religious group isn't stockpilingautomatic weapons or engaged in some other illegal activity, why is thisevent a blow to religious freedom? -MikeP.S. The analogy between BD's and Jews of the Holocaust is so insultingand mind-numbingly stupid I won't even touch it with a ten foot pole.P.P.S. Stop with the paranoid fantasies about the U.S. goverment gunning youdown just because of your religous beliefs.  Trust me, nobody cares.

In actuality it is "chorion", which is the last word Acts> 1:18.  Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss "chorion" so I> cannot report as to the nuances of the word.I abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do fromothers, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I donot feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence inthis example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of researchspecifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is notas tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still amnot competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turnsout that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich "Greek Lexicon" renderseach verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabeticalorder.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax isfar from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makesthings a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 isindeed "chorion." Now I've checked several Greek-English lexicons:"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament," Louw and Nida"Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament""Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament," Grimm"Word study Concordance," Tynsdale"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other  early Christian Writings," Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon," PerschbacherIn each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:A space, place, region, district, field, area, "country place," land, farm, estate, "a bit of tillage", and similar meanings.Nowhere do any of these books mention anything about "grave." As some of these books go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books are all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I think it more likely that Mr Archer's investigations into "contradictions" to be once again, as your friend said it, "lacking in substance," and thus Archer is again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would have honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found themto support Mr Archer's contentions). By the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson's) is the definition of"agros," the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word"agros" is defined as "a field in the country." Chorion is specifically notedas a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how sillyBullinger's exegisis was, which stated that the word for "field" in Matthew(ie: agros) is different from the word for "field" in Acts (ie: chorion), andthus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you alreadyadmit how stupid Bullinger's exegisis is, but this was a small serendipitywhich drives the point home). So as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this particular issue closed.

If you're interested in a change, here's an idea.Do you believe in absolute morality? And do you have absoluteknowledge? Mere mortal you? And if you claim that your God has absoluteknowledge, then you have have absolute knowledge of that?If you read the Bible and claim that it is the Word of God, andin it is contained the absolute moral code you ascribe to, but the prophets,no matter how divinely inspired are not gods but mere fallable mortals,then how can you be absolutely sure that they having heard the Word ofGod, have got it right? Also, you read their words in translation whichinvariably introduces errors of nuance and usage, and then how do youknow that you got the right message? I assert that you do not, and thatyou do not have absolute knowledge of anything, including absolute morals.The only way you can assert such things is through appeal toprejudice via appeal by force of authority through yourself or a groupyou have aligned yourself to.>If morals come from what is societally accepted, why follow that? Because social pressure is the most powerful force known toman. How can you disprove a contention that the richeousness ofestablished religion is anything other than social convention? Oneway is to assert that there are moral universals. But that is notthe same thing as asserting that these universials owe their origento trancendance or the supernatural or to dieties.>What right do>we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally mandated morality?We expect empathy from our fellow man. We expect to raise eachgeneration with values that we live by, those which assure that mistakeswe have made are not repeated. Do you think that mere authority checksall tendancies which are disruptive of civilized life? I think not! In factauthority is power, and power corrupts. The most powerful tend to thinkthat they are above the law that applies to everybody else. Religiousauthority, theocarcy, has not mitigated this any better than otherpower structures on this score and it seems that because there are nochecks on power concentrated in clergy or nobility that the abusesrecorded by history are greater.We live and teach morals by setting an example, starting inthe home. This does not come from books or authority figures insoceity. If people are weak or confused at the present time it isnot because the breakup of the family has been precipitated by somemysterious moral decidance that redidication to traditional formulaswill repair. That is but magical and simplistic thinking. We need tolook at forces in the way we live, even the good things that happenin our present culture, that are weakening the family as the primarymeans we have to teach children values. Of course people are tryingto have the community do things that once were done in the familyalone. This may not be as effective. We need to look at this.>Pardon the extremism, but couldn't I murder your "brother" and say> that I was >exercising my rights as I saw them, was doing what felt good, didn't want>anyone forcing their morality on me, or I don't follow your "morality" ?Laying down the law, and with teeth, doesn't stop the crazyman from murdering your brother despite the morality or the law. Itmay help you with dealing promptly with him after the fact, but itmay not be very effective for preventing mental illness or cracy peoplefrom murduring.It is quite interesting how ineffective moral authoritarianismis in fact. It may work best in societies that are already sonmewhatisolated, that do not experience change, and have long standingtraditions. In a basic way moral codes decrease the number of decisionspeople have to make everyday. In a real sense thay allow people to nothave to think. That is OK when things are stable, but it becomes aproblem when conditions change. This leads me to think that morals arenot sumething fundemental, at least most of them, recalling that thereare values all people seem to agree on, but mutate in response to outsidepolitical, economic, technical, and cultural influiences.Lately, I have come to regard people who speak like youwith great suspicion, especially when they include the pharse "forthe children.".

(yeah right)  In order for *you* to "not pay for anyabortions" through your tax money, *everyone* would have to "not pay forany abortions" through tax money.  If this is the case, then women whohave reasons for "needing" an abortion, but are unable to afford it ontheir own, are just "out of luck".  Their *choice* is blocked because ofecononmic hardship--which is part of why they might "need" the abortionin the first place--and because *some* people don't want to "pay for anyabortions".  On top of that, there is the assumed requirement that thegovernemnt pay the delivery costs for those women who can't afford it,which will also include all of those women who could not afford an abortion.This involves *more money*.Suppose instead there *is* government funding of abortions for women whodesire them but can not afford one on their own.  Those who do not wantan abortion will have the costs of their delivery covered (if they cannot afford it on their own), and those who *do* want an abortion will beable to get one and *save the government money* in the process.  How thenare you "paying for" an abortion?  Rather that abortion is "paid for" bythe cost of *delivery* that it *saves* (and then some), and all becausewe remove the restriction against funding of a perfectly legal procedure.(Notice that this does not apply to cosmetic surgery, which is often usedas an example of "elective surgery" that is not generally paid for justbecause it is desired and can not be afforded.)If you insist on complaining about "paying for" someone's choice to havean abortion when they can't afford it, I will complain about "paying for"the larger costs of *restricting* that choice when they can not afford it.Why should you pay for someone else's choice?  Why should I pay more to*restrict* someone's choice?>(a bunch of other stuff deleted - not related to me :) )>>>>A pro-choice majority would not be enough for one of the two pro-choice>>candidates to win, however a pro-life majority *should* have been enough>>for the only pro-life candidate to win.

I personally think it is >  stupid to vote for someone because of their stance on *one* issue :) .   A pro-lifer who does not consider abortion an *extreemly* important issueis an oxymoron.

It would be awfully nice if reputable poll institutions would have a *clear*,unbiased poll on the issues of abortion.  In order to be unbiased there wouldhave to be allowance made for "shades of grey", rather than lump all of themiddle with one side by tricky wording--such as on the last poll I heardabout.

On thismorning's news, there was an item about the BATF warrant being unsealed.That they bought $200,000 worth of LEGAL weapons has not been denied byanyone.  When they were accused of harming others in the past, the localsherriff had no problems in serving a warrant; our rights as free peoplewere violated by the BATF going in shooting.  This country was founded on the superiority of the rights of the individual.Remember Pastor Niemoller's remarks.-- Herman Rubin, Dept. of Statistics, Purdue Univ., West Lafayette IN47907-1399Phone: (317)494-6054hrubin@snap.stat.purdue.edu (Internet, bitnet)  {purdue,pur-ee}!snap.stat!hrubin(UUCP)

Bit of a coincidence, that.Never lived out in the country I see. 4 years ago I had a placewhere I had to carry in propane every month, hook the bottle up to copper line, to supply both the stove, and a type of water-heater called a flash-heater. A flash heater has a pilot lamp.Here's the point. If the Davidians had their propane tanks hooked up to copper (or some such) lines, run through the ceiling spaces-- when the FBI started wrecking the place, they could easily haveruptured the lines. Which then would start spreading out throughthe overhead. And since it was a country home, it wasn't necessarilybuilt with non-flamable insulation. It's probably more plausible than anything else, that the fire startedmainly as a result of accident -- or willful negligence on the part ofthe FBI, which should have known better (ie. manslaughter).It's certain that if the tanks hadn't been used that day -- the firewouldn't have started.>Whatever the faults the FBI had, the fact is that responsibility>for those deaths lies with Koresh.Paul, what "fact?"
