 9Last year Brein Taylor was in A ball, probably at Tampa in theFlorida State League.  I believe he began this year in AA whichis Albany.  Hopefully George won't rush him and he'll beallowed to progress at his own rate to AAA and then to theBronx.  This guy is the real thing.Jonathan AlboumUVA

 95Having run completely out of time, I've got to get my prophesies andpredictions for the A.L. out.  Qualifications -- one of the worsefinishes in last year's prediction contest.AL East -- 19931.  Baltimore OriolesWhy the Orioles?  Well, I pondered long and hard, and it all came down tothis:  -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction.  -- Can't bring myself to pick the Yankees  -- Milwaukee was a fluke  -- Indians aren't ready to contend  -- Red Sox were bad last year, and didn't get any better  -- Detroit's pitching will be the new definition of "replacement level""But you don't really think the Orioles will win, do you."  No.  As a matterof fact, I can't see any team in the American League winning either divisionon paper (with the possible exception of the Yankees, who I hate).  But some-body has to win, so I pick the Orioles.  "You don't really think that BradyAnderson is going to repeat, do you?"  No.  I'm basing the Orioles predictionon the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis.  "GlennDavis?  That's insane".  Yes.  So, without further ado:STRONG POINTS:  Hoiles, Ripken some years, Olson, getting rid of Billy Ripken.WEAK POINTS:  Segui may start.  Valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be  the fifth starter.  Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup.  (Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize  the effect of a slumping Ripken?  If you can't move Ripken out of the #3  spot, why not move the rest of the line up?)WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year.WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  In a tight pennant race, team trades for Pecota.ObPrediction:  "The Streak" continues.  Harold Reynolds leads the team in  caught stealing.2. New York Yankees.STRONG POINTS:  Abbot, Key, Perez.  Could have best pitching in American  League.  Boggs should improve on Hayes.WEAK POINTS:  Mattingly still considered best hitter.  The Steinbrenner   factor.  (The Yankees lost to the Mets.  Can wholesale changes be far  behind?)  Never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. Wickman & Millitello) to  win a division.WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Boggs hits over .300WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Howe gets arrested again.ObPrediction:  Mattingly won't top a 700 OPS.3.  Toronto Blue JaysSTRONG POINTS:  Management willing to make big deals.  Management has eerie  power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects.  Olerud.  Guzman.  Alomar.WEAK POINTS:  The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick.  Losing Stewart may hurt rotation (that's *really* a bad sign).  No one in  the outfield can get on base.  Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward.WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in AugustWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Club makes no major deals in August.ObPrediction:  Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year.  And  have a losing record.4.  Milwaukee BrewersSTRONG POINTS:  Pitching staff was exceptional -- last year.WEAK POINTS:  Molitor gone.  Surhoff at third?  Why?  Eldred can't keep it up.WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Listach and Eldred play like last year.WOULD BE BAD SIGN:  Bones plays like last year.ObPrediction:  Surhoff won't finish the year at third.5.  Cleveland IndiansSTRONG POINTS:  Baerga, Belle, NagyWEAK POINTS:  Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts.  Starts Felix  Fermin.WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Bielecki's ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts.WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Ted Power -- bullpen ace.ObPrediction:  Alomar will be back on the DL by the all-star break.6.  Boston Red SoxSTRONG POINTS:  Clemens, Viola, Clemens, Detroit, ClemensWEAK POINTS:  Most incompetent GM in baseball.  Key free agent signing -- Andre  Dawson.  Burks is gone -- Hatcher in center.WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Rainouts in between Clemens starts.WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Clemens on the DLObPrediction:  Russell will make Sox fans forget Reardon.  Interpret that how  you will :->7.  Detroit TigersSTRONG POINTS:  Tettleton, Phillips, WhitakerWEAK POINTS:  If Fielder keeps declining, he'll be a shortstop this year.  Worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced -- but not necessarily better.  This year could be *very* ugly.WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder deserving the MVP.WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder not whining about deserving an MVP.ObPrediction:  Cecil *won't* lead the league in RBIs.One more division to go....-- Dale J.

Ruth and Gehrigcouldn't play every position simultaneously.IMO, given the various ages of the Braves and Reds this season,that the Braves will be closer to their peak, while the Redshave slightly passed their peak.Also, if you're going to compare Braves and Yankees, a more appropriatecomparison to the '93 Braves might be the '23 Yankees.

 49icop@csa.bu.edu (Antonio Pera) writes:> Hispanic magazine(April 1993) had a couple of interesting articles about>Hispanic players including its Hispanic All-Star team. >Some of the major points are:NPR's Morning Edition aired a report this morning (4/19) onHispanic/Latin American players in MLB and how they have many ofthe same problems faced by black/negro/African American playerswhen they first entered the league.  However, although baseballhas adjusted to the presence of black players, many Hispanicplayers still labor under the stereotype of being "fireballs,hot blooded, flashy".  The report also emphasised that despitethe rantings (my word) of Jessie Jackson about baseballsdiscrimination against black players in its upper echelons,baseball has actually done much better by black players thanHispanic players.Another interesting point was the language barrier problem.  Thereporter elaborated on an interview with Ruben Sierra which hegave in Spanish to a Spanish speaking newspaper reporter withthe fact that there are maybe 2 major baseball writers thatspeak Spanish, despite the fact that Spanish is one of (if notthe) easiest languages to learn, so easy that the author CormacMcCarthy learned Spanish at age 50 in order to research hisbook, _All The Pretty Horses_.  Yet, few MLB organizationsemploy Spanish speaking personel, one of the exceptions beingthe Oakland A's.Another point:Nearly 90% of Latin American players have some African blood.Yet, most report that they'd never really felt black untilplaying ball in the US.  Ironically enough, it is the early presence of Latin Americanbaseball players in the Major Leagues that support the idea thatbaseball was integrated before the arrival of Jackie Robinson,as many "light black" or "brown", Latin Americans wereincorporated into baseball. /S-- "I did not know the cure for the disease      -------------------  of images, but I believed in the healing     |  Sandra Vigil   |  power of words and stories."                 |  vigil@esca.com |                 - Until the End of the World     -------------------

True,Cone is probably as good as Drysdale, and they have no Koufax, but still,these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals, withlots of low-scoring games, etc.  And they didn't use relievers, whereasJeff Montgomery is having a super season for them.     That being said, I still picked them 5th or so, but I think a superbpitching team can win if they have enough hitting.  There's more of achance of that, I think, than of a team with tremendous hitting but nopitching.  At least, to me.     I wonder, though - which one do you people think would do better - a teamwith Johnson, Koufax in his prime, Seaver, Carlton, and Young, in no realorder, as the starters, with Sutter, Fingers, and Lyle in the bullpen, butwith a puny offense (assuming good defense, like Mazeroski, Maranville, etc.)Or a team with poor pitching, but with an offense of Cobb, Carew, Ruth, Gehrig,Mays, Schmidt, Wagner, and Bench - again,you pick the order.     I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better byseasons' end.  Even the best hitters can succeed only 2/5 of the time intheir best years, but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts - taking allthe players in their prime, they might throw 50 shutouts in a year.  And allthe offense would have to do is get 1 run across.     I wonder if someone with Stratomatic or something could plug such all-time teams into a regular season, have it played, and report the resultsI would love to see that.-- Doug Fowler: dxf12@po.CWRU.edu  : Me, age 4 & now: "Mommys and Daddys & other    Ever wonder if, after Casey : relatives have to give lots of hugs & lovemissed the 3rd strike in the poem: & support, 'cause Heaven is just a greathe ran to first and made it?     : big hug that lasts forever and ever!!!"

What fraction of all runs come on solo HR?Most runs are scored because there happened to be players on base when thebatter did something good.  I use the phrase "happened to be" advisedly.Lots of people have tried to figure out who the players are who have themost ability to "turn it up a notch" in clutch/RBI/whatever situations, andwhat they've found is that there is no evidence that *anyone* has such anability to any measurable extent.  There are no clutch hitters.  People whotend to do things that *would* cause an RBI if there were somebody on baseend up getting RBIs proportional to how many of their teammates obliged bybeing in position.  >My mistake.I agree.--    David M.

A "reasonable" umpire would have realized thatthere was a 1-run game in progress, with two outs in the ninth.  WhatRon Gant did was try to regain his composure.  What a "normal" baseballplayer would have done would have been to get into a heated argumentwith the umpire, and since you can't argue balls and strikes, he wouldhave been ejected from the game.  Ron Gant, by trying to avoid such aconflict, was penalized for showing some restraint.Incidentally, a "reasonable" home plate umpire would not have beenso resistant to seeking the appeal to the first base umpire, as Gantrequested.  If the home plate umpire had appealed to first, the first baseumpire could have wrung up the strike, and Gant would not have been soupset.  If the call had been a ball, and the catcher had requested theappeal, it is likely the home plate umpire would have asked for the help.Finally, the entire game was pretty much a mockery of the so-calledefforts to "speed up the game."  The game was played very quickly, it wasjust at 2 hours when the stuff happened in the ninth, and the only delaysin the entire game had been *the result* of actions by the umpires (other thanDeion having to clean garbage off the field).-- @econ.duke.edu     fls@econ.duke.edu     fls@econ.duke.edu    fls@econ.duke.s  To my correspondents:  My email has been changed.                       el                         My new address is:  fls@econ.duke.edu            df            If mail bounces, try fls@raphael.acpub.duke.edu               u

Cy Young winners don't pitch in a vaccuum, unawareof how their offenses are doing.The Braves' pitching staff is already showing signs ofcracking under the strain of knowing they're not going to get many(if any) runs.

What turned me off were theincessant interruptions to the continuity of the game.  A team scores.2.5 minutes of commercials.  Kickoff.  1.5 minutes of commercials.Three downs and a punt.  2 minutes of commercials.  AAAAARRRRGH!Earlier in this thread I commented on LaRussa and the A's, whom Ibelieve institutionalize slow play.  I don't mind the cat-and-mousegame with Rickey on first;  in fact, I rather enjoy it.  SimilarlyI would enjoy the battle with Listach or Lofton or Polonia on first.  WhatI object to is when such games are played with Karkovice on first,or when the game is a blowout.  I don't mind when the pitcher steps off the mound to gather his thoughts in a crucial situation, or when a hittersteps out of the box to regain his concentration.  What I object tois when hitters and pitchers take such breaks at every opportunity.When a game is exciting, these little delays serve as tension buildersand for me enhance the value of the experience of the game.  When thedelays happen with regularity, they become nuisances, just like thecommercial breaks in football.  I understand the NFL imposed a number of rule changes to "speed up"the games, basically putting an onus on the officiating staff to movethe markers and the ball to the spots faster.  That did not addressthe problem of the continuity of the game.  It may have appeased thesponsors and the networks, but I would be amazed if it did anythingto enhance the experience of the fans.Similary, while some 3-hour baseball games bore me to tears, those are theones where there is no continuity and the players are taking exasperatinglylong periods to get ready for each pitch.  I doubt if anyone watchingthe Braves-Giants game cared about Gant stepping out.  I doubt if anyonewatching that game would have found that pause to be anything but anopportunity to have their complete attention claimed by the drama thatwas present.  I would be totally opposed to any effort that wouldeliminate that aspect of baseball.On the other hand, I wish baseball had a commissioner that was powerfulenough to sit down with Alderson/LaRussa/Duncan and explain that theyare actually hurting the product of baseball by dragging their games out the way that they do.  I sure wouldn't mind a little arm-twistingthere.--The Beastmaster-- Mark Singer    mss@netcom.com

Barnes also had an RBI single to score Thurmond totie the score in the ninth, also off Eckersley (sp?).The A's got their runs on an RBI single by McGwire in the 1st and a solohomer by Reuben Sierra in the 6th.  Deer doubled home Kirk Gibson in the7th for the other Tiger run.John Doherty pitched another strong game for the Tigers, once again lastingthrough the seventh inning.  He was relieved by Bolton and then David Haasin the 8th, and Haas got the win.  Bobby Witt started for the A's, and wasreplaced by Honeycutt in the 6th, followed by Goose Gossage in the 8th, andfinally Eckersly in the 9th.  Doherty gave up both of the A's runs, whileWitt gave up the first Tiger run and Eckerseley gave up the last two.In the post game interview (on WJR radio in Detroit), Sparky Anderson saidits one of the few times he's gotten emotional in his managing career.  Itwas a big moment for him, and I'm sure all of us Tiger fans are unanimouslyvery happy for him.  And what a way to get number 2,000!.Considering the circumstances, I think it might be appropriate to say:                WOOF!      Go Tigers!--Randy

 50Was going over some videos last night.....Studying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of Jose Canseco proved to be veryinteresting.  And enlightening.Here's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco,circa June 1986.1.  He's bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,    not gain more bulk.2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I'd say he's    lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed.3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is    released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -    Canseco can't.  Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his    stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,    they're fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it's hard    to make adjustments in your swing.What would I do, if I were Jose?Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch,so that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing.First, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, thiswill cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to movethe bathead more freely.Second, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.Third, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can findmy 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rollingthe wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out ofthe park.If Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his backproblems, he'll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he couldstill hit 600+ HR.-- *   Gary Huckabay   * "You think that's loud enough, a$$hole?"           **   "Movie Rights   * "Well, if you're having trouble hearing it, sir,   **   available thru  *  I'd be happy to turn it up for you.

However, why doeseveryone say that you want lefthanded starters?  I understand lefthandedspot relievers, even though they usually face more righthanded battersthan lefthanded batters.  I just don't understand why people insiston lefthanded starters, unless there is a park effect (e.g., Yankee Stadium).Most batters in MLB are righthanded, so righthanded starters will havethe platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters.I guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teamsmay be more vulnerable to LHP's than RHP's.  However, this is probablyonly a factor in the postseason, because teams seldom juggle their startersfor this reason during the regular season.I think you just want the best starters you can get, regardless ofwhether they are lefties or righties.  Lefthanded starters tend to havehigher ERA's than righthanded starters, precisely because managersgo out of their way to start inferior lefties (or perhaps because ofthe platoon advantage).Am I missing something here?--Craig

He had a greatcareer, but I would prefer Santo's plus 4 years of a replacement level 3Bman.But I would knock Traynor off the list and replace him by Stan Hack.That's a similar story, Hack's far better hitting outweighs Traynor'ssuperior fielding.  Graig Nettles and Buddy Bell would also be betterchoices (IMHO of course, though some recent net discussion supportsthis point of view.)>>>CF>> 7) Andre DawsonShouldn't that be right field?-- +-----------------------+|  Bob Holt             ||  rjh@allegra.att.com  |+-----------------------+

 16One last infield fly question that has always puzzled me and hasn'tyet been addressed.  I believe the rule also does *not* deal with thissituation:If Infield Fly is declared and the ball is caught, runners can tag upand advance at their own risk, as on any fly ball.However, if the Infield Fly is *not* caught, at what point can arunner legally leave his base w/o fear of being doubled off foradvancing too early?  When theball hits the ground?  When a fielder first touches the ball after ithits the ground?Enlightenment would be appreciated.Jay

Their primary function isto maintain order in the game, keep the game moving, and keep theplayers from trying to kill each other. Umpires have to be extremely tough people. That disqualifies mostof us, both men and women.

I tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues.The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as theyhad little talent on their roster for some time.  Steve Avery, for example,was rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign.His subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ ERA during his rookieyear.  Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle soand then rebound.Bob Horner was also rushed to the majors (out of Arizona State directly) hadgood numbers immediately.I am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith, Craig McMurty, andDerek Lilliquist.  The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came upthat they might have been rushed.  Lilliquist and Smith struggled, but itdidn't hurt PS and DL may have been overhyped.

Those are the arguments against Lopez for the>>Braves for this year.>>Now.  The Braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid>>abilities to call games, to work with the pitchers, to throw out>>runners.  This is the crux of the argument (to me at least).  Both theSDCN and the non-SDCN camps seem to agree on the fact that a catcher'sdefense is basically nonmeasurable at present.  You can talk about howimportant calling a game is, or framing the pitches, or blocking ballsin the dirt.  But there is little or no way to tell exactly how variouscatcher's rank in "defense".  Looking at Lopez specifically; is there any reason to suspectthat he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the Braves(or the media) has labeled him a bad defensive catcher?  As far as Ican tell he doesn't have any particular problem in his mechanics(such as Sasser).  He might be a little rough around the edges in blockingthe ball, or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs toclear that up is playing and practice time.  I can't see how repetitionsat AAA are any better then reps in the majors!  All we're left with is the calling the game aspect.  Olsen  andBerryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helpingthe pitchering staff.  But this is a reputation that is given to almostall veteran catchers.  How is catching at AAA going to help Lopez learnthe major league pitching staff?  The only way any catcher is going tolearn Tom Glavine's pitches is to catch Tom Glavine.  Similarly, I wouldn'tbe supprised if the pitcher's claimed to prefer pitching to Olsen overpitching to Lopez because they are used to pitching to Olsen.  But given time they will say they are comfortable with Lopez.Now, since Lopez can't learn how to handle the major leaguepitcher's while he's in AAA and since he doesn't have any glaringproblem in his mechanics, what is he going to learn in AAA that hecan't learn just as well while in the majors?

 21To encourage the great tradition of Red Sox negativism, I am having a contest to predict the magnitude of the Sox' fall from their current heights.  You must decide first, whether the Sox will be at .500 againat any time during this year.  Then you must predict either:(1) Their record the first time they're at .500, if they are, or(2) Their final record, if they stay above .500 the rest of the year.So Valentine's earlier prediction would go as "13-13" (resend it if you were serious, Val!).ESPN pointed out last night that the last Sox start better than this wasin 1952, when they finished 76-78, in sixth place.So email me your guess, either at "barring@cs.washington.edu" or directlyreplying to this post.Entries close 5 pm PDT on Wed 28 Apr 1993.Dave MB

He changes his stance so much, he losestrack of where the strike zone is. In Wednesday's night game, he was clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good tome. I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is becausehe's changed his stance so much.I'm also a bit concerned that because he's got Palmer and Gonzalez hittingall the homeruns, he'll become competitive, swing even harder and screwhimself up even worse.

 42There's a lot of whining about how much players are overpaid.  I thoughtI'd put together an underpaid team that could win a pennant.  I splurgedand let four of the players earn as much as half a million dollars; thehighest-paid player is Frank Thomas, at $900K.  I cut some players, likeKenny Lofton, Chris Hoiles, Keith Mitchell, Tim Wakefield, and a bunchof pitchers, all of whom could have arguably made the team better at acost of $1 million for the lot of them.  The total team salary is $7,781,500, averaging slightly over $300K a player.  If that's too steep,you can dump Thomas and Bagwell, replacing them with Paul Sorrento anda minimum wager to save a bit over a million dollars, and still have oneof the best teams in the majors.p, Juan Guzman, 500p, Mussina,400p, Castillo,    250p, Eldred,      175p, Rhodes,155p, Militello,   118rp, Rojas,300rp, Beck,250rp, Melendez,   235rp, Hernandez,185rp, Nied,150c, Rodriguez,275c, Piazza,      1261b, Thomas,9001b, Bagwell,    6552b, Knoblauch,5002b, Barberie,1903b, Gomez,312.53b, Palmer,250ss, Listach,350ss, Pena,170lf, Gonzalez,525cf, Lankford,290rf, R.Sanders,275of, Plantier,245-- ted frank                 | "However Teel should have mentioned that though thf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu |  his advice is legally sound, if you follow it the u of c law school     |  you will probably wind up in jail."standard disclaimers      |                    -- James Donald, in misc.legal

Hodapponly qualified for the batting title five times.  Was he injured?  He retired right around his 28th birthday.Anyway, Hodapp put up flashy numbers the year *everybody* put upflashy numbers.  That was his only really good year with a bat; his other .300 years were marred by a lack of power and an inabilityto draw walks.

He's nowhere near as bad as Steve>Garvey, but that's not much of a compliment. I agree with the flavor of this post, but disagree with one specificargument.  That "has great hands" means nothing.  It seems to me thata first-baseman's defensive value is not entirely (or even primarily)from his ability to field grounders or catch popups.  How many suchchances does he get during a game?  Many fewer than he gets chancesto catch throws from 2B,SS,3B and P (I mean the total of these ismuch higher than Grounder/Popup totals).  This implies to me that thereis value in catching these throws well, even if they are high, up-the-lineor in the dirt.  "Good Hands" are needed for such plays, and thus havevalue.  I don't have any numbers for the relative number of occurencesof these plays, but I'd guess that the values of these abilities aresimilar.  It's just like: you don't judge catcher's defense primarilyon how they field bunts and popups. (But not as marked I suppose).Michael

 39Let's look at the effects of inflation on 1930's superstars' salaries.I read once that the Babe made $80,000 one year and that was about as good as it got for him.Let's assume he made that in 1928 (I'm not sure of the figures, but I knowI'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-)Today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement ifnot accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth.FV = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928)   = $80,000 x (1.04)^65   = just over $1,000,000.Assuming inflation is average of around 5%.FV = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65   = almost 2,000,000.(I didn't crunch these numbers beforehand).These numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly overpaid.  The Babe appears to have made then what today's average to aboveaverage players make now.  Perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but I don`t think I'm off by much.Chop ChopMichael Mule' -- Michael Andre MuleGeorgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta Georgia, 30332uucp:  ...!{decvax,hplabs,ncar,purdue,rutgers}!gatech!prism!gt0523eInternet: gt0523e@prism.gatech.edu

The stats show heis a mediocre pitcher at best (this year is another case), he just happenedto win 21 games. I saw many of his games last year, he did pitch some goodgames. But this crap about being a clutch pitcher is nonsense, he was constantly giving up go ahead runs in the 6-8th innings (the clutch innings)and the Jays would somehow scrape a win for him. Another major factor inhis 21 wins, is that Cito 'I dont realize i have a bullpen' Gaston wouldleave Morris in for ever, therefore giving him many more chances to wingames (i believe this is the major reason he won 21 games last year).Barry WalkerBNR OttawaCanadaMy opinions

(the south bend     white sox actually do this).violence: baseball players are such utter wuss boys.  the pitcher beans     the batter, and both benches empty in what is called a "bench-clearing     brawl".  EVERYBODY JUST STANDS THERE AND LOOKS AT EACH OTHER. stand,     stand, stand.  look, look, look.  ho, hum.  then, the bullpens     come running in.  when they reach the "fight", they just stand     there, too.     anybody coming off the bench who does not throw at least one punch     should be suspended and fined.  further, the bullpens should fight     it out in the outfield, so as not to waste time and energy running     to the infield.football: sex, violence.basketball: sex, violence.hockey: violence.baseball: "da pastime of da nayshun!" - yawn.bob vesterman.

 77Message-ID: <sfoVX7O00WB4MIUm0d@andrew.cmu.edu>NNTP-Posting-Host: andrew.cmu.eduSo far Simmons looks like a total idiot.1) Zane Smith should learn how to "switchpitch" and return from the DL. Iwould rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at all.2) I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had animpressive win last week. NOw Otto's latest debacle has restored Simmon'sreputation. Now he looks like he is back in his '92 form when he had theAL's highest ERA among starters. Four our sake(not Ted's sake), I hope hepitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah, right.3) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing. They are still doing decently.BUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they haveshown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a littlebit worse. Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters.Merced had a very good OBA his rookie year. He showed a lot of concentration atthe plate in his rookie year.4) Walk: Well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. BUt I still think thatWalk desrved his contract.5) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation. Ican't understand his and management's fear of losing Tom Prince throughwaivers. Even if they do, what's the use. He is aright hander like Slaught.Not a very smart platoon. Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving himway too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaughtshould have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handedpitching). Didn't Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year, and attempt totrade LaValliere last year itself? Any fool could tell them LaVAllierewasn't very fit last year.6) Dennis MOeller is SCARY!!!7) Candeleria: Well, he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of theseason. Maybe it will be in 3-4 range. BUt $1 million  plus? Come on. Otherthan the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks,Patterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to havepitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the moneyon Patterson in stead.8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn't been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke.10) Slaught: How come he wasn't given a contract extension last year? NOw hisvalue has increased immensely.11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount.Let's see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better.Now why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is betterthan a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won't be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreementin favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing thatidiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay.13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. TheRF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replacetwo of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made avery respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would havea respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hitleft handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have optionsfor the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon's tenure wasgetting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave.they will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed.Now, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots,nothing else will.On a final note. Tim Wakefield won't be as awful as he was in his last 2starts. BUt don't count on him pitching like last year for the rest ofthe season. Also, if the Pirates are in contention towards rthe end of theseason, they will miss Redus's clutch hitting and his speed(he has peakedin the second half of the last 2 seasons)>-Pravin Ratnam

WhileI'm all for cutting down the number of chain-rattles and other examplesof rampant Hargroving, there was a difference here.1)  Since time immemorial, batters have complained about calls.So have pitchers and catchers.  Usually, nothing happens.Unless the league notified teams this year about not allowingcomplaints, Hirschbeck was acting against expectations.2)  It's not as if Gant was "in Hirschbeck's face".  Gant saidsomething about the call, stepped out of the box, and turned awayfrom Hirschbeck.  As a hitter (alibet of little consequence, butwith a decent eye), whenever receiving the short end of the stickon a questionable call, I'd want a moment or two out of the box,if for no other reason than to rethink the strike zone based onthe experience of the last pitch.  And if I was really angryat the ump, I'd rather turn away and catch my breath thanturn to him and say something that might get me tossed,especially at a key moment in the game.When Gant turned away, Hirschbeck IMMEDIATELY motioned for Gantto step into the box.  IMO, at this point in time, Hirschbeckwas determined to show Gant exactly WHO was in charge of this game.Gant wasn't dawdling; he hadn't had a chance to dawdle.  And Hirschbeckwas simply exercising a power play.  Gant resisted, as many ofus might to what we thought was an unreasonable request, andHirschbeck called for the pitch.  At that point, Cox came out onthe field, the pitch was thrown, and many other Braves left thedugout.  Cox was tossed "protecting his player".  I was pleasantlysurprised that Gant kept his cool enough to stay in the game.It's a small sample size, but based on what I saw in that game,Mark Hirschbeck has a hair-trigger temper and a need to playGod on the field.  Not good qualities for an umpire.  I willkeep my eyes open for future appearances of Hirschbeck in the future, in order to improve my sample size.IMO, any game where you remember the name of the umpire wasa bad game for the umpire.Eric Roush

Remember: the rulesays it's a strike if ANY PART of the ball passes through the strike zone.I would certainly agree that  high strikes are not called (who could arguethis point?) but all in all I think in and out is called pretty well.RStimets

It has something to dowith the fact that we live in America, and everyone is entitled towhatever he can legally obtain.  If Sandy Alderson and the Haas familywillingly negotiate a salary of $35 million per year with Rickey, I couldn'tcare less.But what REALLY GETS MY GOAT is the bullshit he spouted in spring training,about `Well... sometimes I may not play as hard, or might be hurt moreoften, in a place where I'm not appreciated'.  This quote was in the Chronicleabout the second week of camp, and strongly suggests that he was going to dog it all year if the ownership didn't kiss his butt and ante up somemore money.  For God's sake, Rickey, you signed a contract 4 years ago,now honor it and play!  Say all you want to about Steve Garvey, and believeme, I hated him too, but at least when he put his signature on a pieceof paper he shut his mouth and played hard until the contract was up.Matt Bohnert

As Roger Lustig pointed out in aprevious response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball wasbecause she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner ona constant basis.  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla,on the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time. If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be adifferent story.  Furthermore, he is merely an athlete.  He doesn't have tohire anyone as Schott had to do.  Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who isan admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Metsgame at Shea.  He, like you, thinks that Bonilla should be suspended frombaseball.  Pallone is hoping for a year's suspension.  In my opinion,that's downright ludicrous.  As Howie Rose on WFAN said, if you startsuspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single timeunder whatever conditions, then you'd probably have enough people remainingto play a three-on-three game.  Now, honestly, if you truly analyze thedifferences between the two cases that you bring up in your article, Iwould think that you'd reconsider your thoughts.                                    -Sean*******************************************************************************  "Behind the bag!"            - Vin Scully*******************************************************************************

 10OK, OK, OK. First, my apologies for perhaps being untimely with this subject material and perhaps overly optimistic in my request, but here goes anyhow:I'm *very* interested in finding out how I might be able to get two tickets for the All Star game in Baltimore this year. My very aged folks live about 50 miles away and I know it would be a great thing for them to attend the game. I went with them, and my grandfather who got me into baseball as a small child, to the All Star game in DC many years ago. Although I'm now in the SF Bay Area, I'd *love* to be able to treat my folks to this game; it's absolutely the last chance they'd ever have to attend this game locally.Any info would be greatly appreciated!!!!Mary Colemcole@informix.com

But thepitcher is 80% of the defense.  The primary role of every other playeris on offense.  Even shortstops are a bigger part of the offensivegame than of the defensive game.  (They might not do much with theirpart of the offense, but that's another issue.)That being said, I think both Smith and Yount deserve the HOF.

 16Did anyone notice the words "NOT FOR BASEBALL" printed on the pictureof Joe Robbie Stadium in the Opening Day season preview section in USAToday? Any reason given for this?Also, I just noticed something looking at the Nolan Ryan timeline inthe preview. On 8/22/89, Rickey Henderson became Nolan's 5000th strikeout.On 6/11/90 he pitched his 6th no-hitter against Oakland. I believe thelast out in the game was made by Rickey Henderson. And on 5/1/91, Nolanpitched his 7th no-hitter on the same day a certain someone stole his939th base, which overshadowed it. It seems that Nolan is having a lot ofpublicity at Rickey's expense. IMO, Rickey deserves it, and it seems asmost of the net agrees with me from what I've seen on it lately. They areboth great players, but IMO, Nolan has outclassed Rickey, both in playingand more importantly, in attitude. Just my thoughts.Kevin

 22I like the Clark-WIlliams-Bonds order.Pitchers can only walk Clark with 2 outs (unlike last year).Williams is getting better pitches to hit with Bonds loomingin the on-deck circle.  Since Matt has a terrible batting eye,this helps the Giants a lot.When Bonds gets on base all by himself, he can try to steal 2ndand then be driven in with a single by Thompson, Manwaring, or Clayton.If you bat Bonds before the other sluggers, then you don't wanthim to run because a "caught stealing" could take you out of abig inning.Also Bonds is less in need of protection behind him because heis such a good base stealer (a walk is a potential double).The only draw back is when Clark and Williams are clogging up the bases infront of Bonds... and I think that's a problem the Giants will be glad to see especially if Robby Thompson gets hot.Ken Kubey         kubey@wpd.sgi.com  (415) 390-3536

Winfield has  meant more to his team than Henderson. Unlike daryll, henderson tries  hard. He is an amazing centerfielder. Rickey is VERY good, maybe better  than winfield, I was angry at the dissing of winfield. Though Winfield has  been better than henderson lately. Check the numbers, winfield may  surprise you. He will have 3000 basehits, and should have 500 homeruns  when he retires(wishful thiniking if he plays to 45)

But this is *irrelevant*.

He hit that well last year (afteradjusting his stats for park and league and such); he hit better (on anabsolute scale) than Olson or Berryhill did.  By a lot.As for rushing...  If there really is a qualitative difference between theminors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment (and I don'tbelieve there is), then wouldn't you rather waste Lopez's 22-year old goodseason than his 23-year old very good season or his 24-year-old excellentseason?

 31Joe Torre has to be the worst manager in baseball.For anyone who didn't see Sunday's game,With a right hander pitching he decides to bench Lankform, a left handedhitter and play jordan and gilkey, both right handers.Later, in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he putslankford, a 300 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses LuisAlicea, a 250 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter.  What the Hellis he thinking.Earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring Mark Whiten he commentedhow fortunate the Cardinals were to get Whiten and that Whiten would be aregular even though this meant that Gilkey would be hurt, But torre saidhe liked Gilkey coming off the bench.  Gilkey hit over 300 last year,what does he have to do to start, The guy would be starting on most everyteam in the league.Furthermore, in Sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate, The replay showed Bucky Dent the third base coach looking down the lineand waving lankford home, I can't take this anymorebrian, a very distressed cardinal fan.-- Brian Landmann                                            Georgia Institute of Technology                           Internet:gt7469a@prism.gatech.edu

This wouldhelp so that the O's could make some real free agent signings in the offseason. Training Camp reports that everything is pretty positive rightnow. The backup catcher postion will be a showdown between Tackett and Parentalthough I would prefer Parent. #1 Draft Pick Jeff Hammonds may be comingup faster in the O's hierarchy of the minors faster than expected. MikeFlanagan is trying for another comeback. Big Ben is being defended bycoaches saying that while the homers given up were an awful lot, most camein the beginning of the season and he really improved the second half. Thismay be Ben's year. I feel that while this may not be Mussina's Cy Young year, he willbe able to pitch the entire season without periods of fatigue like last yeararound August. I really hope Baines can provide the RF support the O's need.Orsulak was decent but I had hoped that Chito Martinez could learn defensebetter and play like he did in '91. The O's right now don't have manyleft-handed hitters. Anderson proving last year was no fluke and Cal's returnto his averages would be big plusses in a drive for the pennant. The rotation should be Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald, Rhodes, ?????. Olson is aninteresting case. Will he strike out the side or load the bases and then getthree pop outs?

The lengthier gamesare so because of batters stepping out of the box, pitchers takinglonger between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managersand pitching coaches.And while it's true that the gaps between plays can be interesting, thisis only true when they don't become extra-long.  Quickly-pitched gamescan grab and hold your attention much better.Bring back the two-hour baseball game!

 15Pitchers are required to pitch (or feint or attempt a pick-off)within 20 seconds after receiving the ball, not 15.Pitchers are required to pitch their warm-up throws within aone minute time frame, beginning after each half inning ends,not two minutes.And the reason why a reliever should be allowed warm-ups issimple: Different mound, different catcher.Ryan RobbinsPenobscot HallUniversity of MaineIO20456@Maine.Maine.Edu

Playing in the cavern at Albany (AA) lastyear (375/410/385 down the alleys and to center), Davis went .285/.355/.483with 22 homers. There aren't any small parks on the road in the EasternLeague, either. He's 23(!) and his MLE was .258/.308/.416, 17 HR. I have nofielding statistics, but from seeing him a number of times last year I'd saythat he's not Brooks Robinson, but neither is he Howard Johnson. Unless theythink they can win the pennant *this year* (which seems possible) and needBoggs to do it, I think they're making the same sort of mistake with Davisthat Boston made with Boggs, leaving him in the minors for two or threeyears after he'd shown that he was a good hitter.>>3.

I believe all of thepeople mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. Ifeel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve togo but that they would deserve it more. IMHO Dave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were hecould hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do notthink he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for thegame. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and Istill would not back him for the Hall of Fame.Dave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had severalseason where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite abit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some otherpeople but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantialcontributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this aresome of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when hewas with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up toand while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame Ithink it deserves some consideration.Lee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately woulddeserve to go before the likes of Kingman.Darrell Evans - No.Eddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (althougha silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am notsure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's boththe average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Justthink, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.Jeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off thetop of my head I would take Lee Smith first.|> |>      Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody|> giving|> |> Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards,|> marginal.|> |> Honestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there. They're both|> |> shortstops that just hung around for a long time. Big deal.|> Well, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. Italked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have beeninstumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have verygood offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbersoffensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run forevery run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would haveshattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays savedgames? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win agame? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about morethan numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).Both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As doesGeorge Brett who also belongs in this class of player.|>      Let's be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors|> so|> |> liberally.

Jack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone mightbring up his name.Kirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he stillhas time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then myprobably will turn into a definately.Nolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about himhaving some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did nothear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has thecontributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I wouldnot say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not eventop 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Famebecause of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers -even with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALLthe possible votes.So in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably dobut I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at leastnot without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.Yes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O. Smith, Puckett and RyanMaybe - Murray and L. SmithNo - Reardon, Garvey, Morris, Evans and definately KingmanAs I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back thisup - these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions.Mike|> |>                                  Q Steve

Those are the arguments against Lopez for the>Braves for this year.But the players who *are* ready are 1)the best and 2) the ones mostlikely to benefit from being in the majors. Javy Lopez is not a middle-of-the-road prospect. He's the real thing. NOW. Again, the most important thing a player can do is hit. Lopez does thatmiles better than Olson or Berryhill. If his defense is good enough forGreenville, or Richmond, it's good enough for Atlanta. If he really wasawful defensively, he would no longer be a catcher. See Sprague, Ed.>Now.  The Braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid>abilities to call games, to work with the pitchers, to throw out>runners.

The kid *will* improve playing at AAA, and>he probably won't being a reserve with the big club.  Oh, where to start... OK. First of all, solid != good. I want good players.Solid is one of those words used to describe nice white guys who reallyaren't very good at baseball. Think of it as "TWG" without the caps.It's a losing strategy to say, "We have solid guys, we don't need to improve."You used it four times in that paragraph, BTW.Same for experienced. I might add, though, that Greg Olson and DamonBerryhill aren't exactly Carter and Fisk. Olson has played three years,Berryhill five, although 90 and 91 were a wash. The only difference,IMHO, between Olson and Valle is the supporting cast."Two big bats." Hrm. I like Justice, but I find Mr. Gant's trend disturbing.Call it one and a maybe. The Braves' platoon is OK, but neither playerhas *any* value outside of the platoon. Bream vs. LH and Hunter vs. RHare awful. I'll leave the thirdbase comment alone. Pendleton has wastedtoo much bandwidth already. If the CF platoon hits .300, I'll retraceMr. Likhani's midnight run down Forbes, and I live in NY and LA.(Got that, Mike?)And doesn't Cox call pitches, anyway?>goodness.

I don't think he'snearly as good as people make him out to be, and he can't turn the DPto save his life.  He comes across the bag improperly, and his releaseis slow.

 60Sender: nntp@mizar.usc.eduMessage-ID: <1qll47INNlr3@mizar.usc.edu>NNTP-Posting-Host: mizar.usc.eduWent to the Dodgers game tonight -- it was cap night. Astacio pitched ok, but had control trouble all night.In the first, he walked a batter, balked him to second, thena single scored the run, with the batter taking second on thethrow home.  Another single made the score 2-0 Cards. Lasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler, Reed, And Piazzabatting third!  Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyderand Webster. Piazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 Cards.The Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out singleby Offerman. By the fourth inning, Astacio had already made about 80 pitches, butthe score was still 2-2.  The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressiveplays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runnertrying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first whohad strayed a bit from first base, etc. Karros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going intothe outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was goingthrough, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threwto third and EASILY got the runner at third. My heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen. Astacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the gamewith the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over. Gross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1/3innings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inninggame had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was freshgiven his light work out Tuesday. Gross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hitto the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resultedin a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the nextthing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner onfirst was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run hadscored long before that. Meanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning.Lee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karrosand Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?).Cory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, butthat was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got histhird straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was myfree Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.  If Piazza keeps thisup all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the yearhonors.  Though its really early, Karros is already showing signsof a sophomore jinx year. The final score...Cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits.Dodgers 2 runs on 7 hits. Dodger
 30You want to speed up ballgames?1.  Enforce the two minutes between innings.  As it is, many fields are    allowing THREE minutes between them.  Fifteen seconds before     TV commercials are gone to, Thirty or so before action begins upon    the return to the game.  Two minutes, last out to first pitch, or    a ball is called.2.  Don't grant time to batters just because they want it.  They may get    pissed at first, but they'll get in line, once anything the pitcher    throws while they're adjusting their wristbands is a strike.3.  Mandate a rule permitting only N seconds between pitches (the current    rule is too lenient), and then enforce it.  Fifteen seconds is more    than enough time.  If the pitch isn't released in 15, call it a ball,    and restart the clock.Baseball games take about 2:51 in the NL, and just a shade under 3 hoursin the AL.  That's just too damn long.  I don't like to PLAY in 3 hourgames, much less WATCH a game for that long.  My butt falls asleep, andif I'm watching on TV, I'll channel surf between pitches, catchingcolorized versions of Mr. Ed, Leave it to Beaver, and "Those WackyNieporents" on Nick at Nite.-- *   Gary Huckabay   * "You think that's loud enough, a$$hole?"           **   "Movie Rights   * "Well, if you're having trouble hearing it, sir,   **   available thru  *  I'd be happy to turn it up for you.

 10OK, OK, OK. First, my apologies for perhaps being untimely with this subject material and perhaps overly optimistic in my request, but here goes anyhow:I'm *very* interested in finding out how I might be able to get two tickets for the All Star game in Baltimore this year. My very aged folks live about 50 miles away and I know it would be a great thing for them to attend the game. I went with them, and my grandfather who got me into baseball as a small child, to the All Star game in DC many years ago. Although I'm now in the SF Bay Area, I'd *love* to be able to treat my folks to this game; it's absolutely the last chance they'd ever have to attend this game locally.Any info would be greatly appreciated!!!!Mary Colemcole@informix.com

If it is, I wouldn't give the book,or anything in it any value whatsoever.  Klapisch wrote thebook to make money (obviously) and sensational literature isgoing to sell a lot better than what he usually writes for thepapers.  I'm not calling him a liar, but if there was any proofthat a Met player had raped a little girl before a game (letalone doing it on a regular basis) they would be in jail, notShea.For those people who do not know what the press is likein New York, it is probably more cut-throat than in just aboutany other part of the U.S.  Keith Hernandez said it very well onESPN a couple of days ago, they would much rather mention aclubhouse fight, than a two-run homer in the ninth to win agame.  I do not read Klapisch's news columns regularly, but Ido know that he has been accused before as being an instigatorthat enjoys (hopefully for only professional reasons) to drumbup a news story, even if there isn't one there.  Now as far asthe confrontation with Bobby Bonilla a few days ago, I almosttotally blame Bonilla.  No matter what a member of the pressdoes, and no matter how much of a putrid individual he mightbe, that does not give a ballplayer the right to threaten ajournalist.  Personally, I always thought that a beat writer thatalways follows a club around should report the news, but not belooking to degrade a team.  I don't know whether to blameKlapisch, because that may be the only way to keep a job in NewYork.

Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent:Morning show:  In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi, and Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morgantihad a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP triesto copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms ofsports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but heinterjects humor and politics into his show.10 AM to 12 Noon:  I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in theirabilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has theadvantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the callerwho is asking about who the local team is going to draftin the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN getbetter interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say thatthey were not interested in interviews with celebrities unlessit was a major story.  I would consider this even because they are two differentstyles of host.12 Noon to 2 PM:  At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to Jody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only beenon for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the abilityto transcend the "homer" mentality of the Philadelphia fanbase.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia spelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan.Where else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0score without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning 'guys')I do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnightand I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotatinghosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on either station by a good margin.  If you are in NY andyou can't get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.2PM to 4PM:  This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and Russo(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most dividedin my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining,but they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10to 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD doget great guests and that is the basis for their show, soit is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is theappearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, whichare often hilarious.  4 PM to 7 PM:  MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I likeMike Missanelli but I just can't stomach Steve Fredericks.  I know that SF came from Philly originally, but when hewas at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Phillyhomer now.  I don't listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless thereis a game on that night, but you will see later for the reason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.7 PM to Midnight:  S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makesEli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice oncharges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on mynerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I gonuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show)On FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, MetsJets, or St. John's basketball.  If the game is on thewest coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of courseI think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, butWIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season.(If this is the sports station, why did they lose theIGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.))During the summer, itis all talk on WIP.Overall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, withthe exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.

 18I haven't been following the previous HR's.  But there are two, that I sawlive that would have to be up there (up where? there!).  1) Rick Monday's HR to bury the Expos in the NL championship in 1981.It was hit off Steve Rogers, who is a RHP and primarily a starter.Why was he used as a reliever when the 'Spos had Reardon and BillLeewarming up in the bullpen.  Considering Monday couldn't touch LHP,Lee would have been a safe bet.  He wasn't even doing any drugs at thattime (or so he told me and around 50 others on a recent venture into Montreal.  The blast wasn't the important aspect.  It was the timing.Seventh game, a tie game, and in the top of the 9th.  The Expos almostcame back though...2) Mike Schmidt hit one that killed the Expos in 1980.  So close, yet, sofar.and3) Strawberry killed a pitch on the second day of the season a couple ofyears ago.  It went off the technical ring in the Big O.  It almost leftthe stadium!  That was hit HARD!!!CorelMARK!

 9I totally agree with each point you made.  Jose Viscaino lookedlike a single A hitter up there.  Who swings on 3-1 count with Maddux pitching and your teams down by a run, and you haven't touched the ball all day.  I also think too much is made of that lefty-righty thing.  Watchingthe Cubs games I get the feeling Steve Stone knows a lot more about whatthe Cubs should be doing than Lefebre does.  Harry said it best when hestated after another terrible Vizcaino at bat-- we can't wait tilSandberg returns!

 14I just wanted to let everyone know that I have lost what little respect I havefor Jim LeFebvre after seeing today's Cubs game. First of all how could hestart Maldonado over May. After the way May played at the end of last year andthe way he tore up the Cactus League how could you let him sit the bench? Notto mention that a right hander (Maddux) started. I really blew my top whenLefebvre pinch hit for Rick Wilkins with TOMMY SHIELDS! How can you do thatjust because of the lefty-righty thing, too much is made of that. Wilkins istwice the hitter that Shields is. Then the next batter was Jose Vizcaino, oneof the weakest hitters I have ever seen, and who had looked terrible at bat allday, and Lefebre let him hit, while May still sat the bench. I think even ArnieHarris was stunned by this because he showed May sitting in the dugout whileVizcaino was batting. Face it Lefebvre has got to be the worst manager inbaseball.A dishard Cub fan

Mitchell hit close to .300 in Atlanta and continued to walk alot after his promotion.

 17  Well, it really isn't this cut and dry, but as a Jay fan the thing I fearedworst has happened. The Yanks sent down Williams G and are going to startWilliams B in CF.  I also believe they kept Wickman and Millitello in their rotation, which ismuch nicer than that Kaminiecki and Mike Witt combo I thought they'd throwout their to the slaughterhouse because of their "experience". Granted, Witt"might" be good, but I think that they used rationale to keep the youngstersup and not given the job to Witt because he was a good pitcher and hasexperience.  The Yanks are showing that they are taking positive strides forwards; theJays with the loss of Dave Stewart are looking at gigantic holes in theirpitching staff.  The Orioles should also be there in the end.....Gord Niguma(to salvage the season,let JJ Olerud win MVP)

Bill James is a partial owner of STATS, inc.  However he has almostnothing to do with the day-to-day operations of the company, although hedoes have significant input into the design of the books that bear his name.(The handbook, but not the scoreboard).  To the best of my knowledge, theonly things that Bill actually writes for STATS are the predictions sectionof the handbook, and the Bill James Fantasy Baseball rulebook.2.) The debate over Elias goes way back.  Bill James' early stuff was hamperedby the fact that Elias would not give access to their stats at any price.Project Scoresheet, and later, STATS were founded to fill this void.  Youcan call STATS, and ask them for a report on just about anything in theirdatabase, and they will provide it -- for a price, of course.  Or you couldjust log into their online system and look at the data yourself.  Havingattempted to pry numbers from Elias in the past (football, not baseball), theyjust don't do that.  In STATS eyes, the high ground comes from making theinformation available at all.3.)  That being said, I'm pretty dissapointed by Bill's book this year, too.I am given to understant that it was mostly a response to the publishers desire to have the book come out sooner than April.Hope this makes things just a little bit clearer.(Bias alert.  I am a former part-time employee of STATS.)Noel Rappinnoel@chaos.cs.brandeis.edu

My>*supposition* is that if we were to find the SAME players consistently>(year after year) at one end of the bell or the other, then we might>be able to make some reasonable conclusions about *those* players>(as opposed to all baseball players).Let's be careful here.  If players' performance was completely randomin (Clutch-No Clutch), then you would still expect some players to begood in the clutch every year and some to be not-so-good every year.With two years worth of data, you'd have 1/4 of the players good eachyear, 1/4 bad each year, and 1/2 would have one good and one bad year.We have 96 players for 5 years ('84-'88).  Just flipping a coin, you'dexpect 3 players to be good all 5 years and 3 to be bad every year.This is what we actually get--No. of good years    0    1    2    3    4    5Clutch performers    4   10   37   24   18    3Coin flip (random)   3   15   30   30   15    3Essentially the distribution of clutch performers by number of yearsof good performance is the same as what you would get if the processleading to deviations from non-clutch performance was completely random.If there was anything to clutch hitting (at least in this definition)that had any predictive capability, you expect to see the number ofplayers at the ends to be much larger than that predicted by flippinga coin.  Further, if you limit yourself to players who were a lot aboveor below average in clutch situations (say, 1 standard deviation from the mean) more than one year, the random explanation still looks good.In the four years ('84-'87) that I looked at the data from Elias, therewere 79 (29) players with a minimum of 25 (50) at bats in clutch situations that were 1 sigma from the mean two different years.  Ofthose 79 (29) players, 38 (14) of them changed sign between the twoyears.  In other words, they were great clutch hitters one year andreally horrible the other year.  If it was just a random process, you'd expect those numbers to be 39.5 (14.5).  Everything that's been measured about clutch hitting over a periodof years that could be used to predict any ability with any proposed definition has looked like a random process (with the caveat that there may be something related to platoon advantagethat could be dragged out of the data--e.g., John Lowenstein probably never had a "clutch" AB against a left-handed pitcher,but he might well have had some in blowouts, so that there wouldbe a bias since his clutch ABs would be more geared to his platoon advantage).  This is not a subject that has been glancedat casually.  A lot of people have put a lot of effort into studying it and every one of them, with the exception of theElias study, has been unable to find anything that would allowyou to predict how someone will do in clutch situations betterthan flipping a coin.

Perhaps, but I doubt it.  If you tell Joe Carterto go up there and take a few pitches, he will draw more walks, buthe also won't hit as many frozen ropes into the bleachers becausehe is more likely to hold back on a pitch that he used to drive.The "Patient/Power" guys?   Joe Morgan had a small strike zone andRickey Henderson has "a strike zone the size of Hitler's heart" so they get their walks based on the small zone.Look at the other 5 guys: Thomas, Bonds, McGwire, Ruth and Williams.  Wow!A lot of pitchers would rather nibble at the corners and maybewalk these guys that to throw a clear strike to them.The pitchers would do better (in my opinion) by just coming afterthem with a good fastball for a strike on the first pitch, but pitcherswould rather nibble, go 2-0 or 3-1 and then get hurt.Ken Kubey         kubey@wpd.sgi.com  (415) 390-3536

 36To all those out there wondering about who holds the record for threehomer games ina career, the answer is Johnny Mize in his career with the Cards and the Yanks.  He hit three 6 times.  I am almost sure about this. Incase anyone is wondering, the record for two homer games is held by BabeRuth and is 72.  Mize's record may not last for much longer because of JuanGonzalez.  He has at least three games with three and maybe 4.  I know that he had at least two last year and one as a rookie.  I don't have any recordbooks at college for me to check on though.  Please let me know, okay, if I am wrong.  Onto the Padres.  Is there anyone out there who follows them?- especial-ly those with access to local news?  I don't here anything in Los Angeles and Ican't get McPaper consistently around here.  comment:  It looks as though San Diego has gotten the better of the two dealsthat brought Bell and Plantier to the Padres.  It has also forced the team to use Darrell Shermann.  Of course, Plantier could get injured again or he could hit with the power of 91 but with a lower average.  Bell always could finishwith .240 and 15-18 hrs-essentially Jerald Clark's numbers.  leadoff comment:  Craig Shipley??????  I get on base 29% of the time if I'm lucky at leadoff?  Hell, of the usual starters, use Gwynn.  He's got 4 stealsalready.  Is Shipley starting because of an injury to Stillwell, though?  Ihaven't seen Stillwell's name in any box scores.  Anyway unless you are goingto use Shermann at leadoff then use Gwynn.  He at lesat gets on base and thisyear is stealing bases.Sheffield comment:  Though the season is early and stats mean nothing.Witness Phillips batting .500+ currently.  But does Sheffield have an injury,or anythingelse wrong with him.  I just don't hear anything.Andy Benes:  Is he pitching like he did in the second half of '91?   or is this a flash of promise that he throws out evrey now and then?   Has anyone seen him pitch the two good games?score for today, Sunday april 18:  Padres 10, St Louis 6.  Padres sweep theCardinals as Gwynn goes 5 for 5 with a homer.

 76Yes - Everyone seems to be in agreement that the Yankees are finally moving in the right direction.  They should finishover .500 this year and maybe even be in the pennent race in August.  However, I would take back a few moves:1.  The Jim Abbott Trade.    I think Abbott is not only an inspirational person, but a    great pitcher also.  He could win the Cy Young this year,     but he won't because the right side of the Yanks infield    isn't good enough.  So why was this not a good trade?      JT Snow.  How many rookies have been able to step in and    immediately have the impact that he has had so far on     the Angels?  I know it's early, but if you've seen this kid    hit, field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be     a tremendous player.  The Yanks should have kept him.  What    about Mattingly, you ask?  Well - it's great that the Yanks    have taken care of him and remained loyal, but he's 10 years    older than Snow and just doesn't have the same bat speed as    before his back injury.  It's a shame, but as a Yankee fan     who wants to see the *best* Yankee team, I'd take     Snow over Mattingly at first.  The Yanks also gave up two    promising propects with Snow for Abbott.  Besides, with    Domingo Jean, Brien taylor, Wickman, Militello, and Sterling    Hitchcock, they are just loaded with propects.  I know Abbotts    only 26, but this was too much to give up.  I believe George    forced this trade because he believes (and he's right) that    Abbott will be a big hit in NY.  However, I'd like to see the    Yankees build a baseball team, not an amusement show.2.  Wade Boggs.    I live in Boston and like Wade a lot.  But, his career is     winding down and I would rather see the Yanks start to develop    a long term solution (i.e. Hensley Muelins, Russ Davis, Velarde?).    Besides, Wade just doesn't have any range.  What a shame about    Charlie Hayes, huh?3.  Spike Owen.    See Wade Boggs.  I'd much rather see them develop Dave Silvestri    or whoever.  Wade and Spike next to each other in the infield is    going to raise the Yankee staff ERA 1/2 point.  And these guys    are on the down sides of their careers.4.  Danny Tartabull.    Yes - he's put up some tremendous numbers and it's nice to think    about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year.  But he    never is.  We should expect 120 games max out of him.  Meanwhile,    Gerald Williams is playing at Columbus and Paul O'Neil is playing    left field!  I believe O'Neil led NL outfielders in assists    last year - and Tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder.What I'm basically getting at is the Yanks are moving in the rightdirection but are NOT ready to win a pennent this year.  They should(at the GM level) be planning for a 1994 or 1995 world series.  Thismeans getting the younger players experience in the majors NOW so they will be ready in a year or two.  I'm afraid that all this stuff wreaks of George Steinbrenner.Certainly, the Boggs deal was all George.  It looks like George isplanning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a worldseries now.  The veterans are always available and can be added at anytime (like Boston did this year).  Develop the young players first,then add the one or two veterans (or in the Yankees case, just keepthem).  Let's all us Yankee fans hope that George doesn't dismantlethe terrific job Stick and company have done building the Yankeeorganization back into one of respect.  I'm really afraid that he willtrade whoever it takes to patch holes today (relief pitching forexample).  George must realize that the Yankees rebuilding process isstill one or two years away.  Have patience George and we will allenjoy the future.  Fire Bucky and trade the kids and it's baseballhell for all loyal Yankee fans for a long time!Sam "I'm not Militello or Millitello" Mandelbaum.

 63kubey@sgi.com (Ken Kubey) said:>I suppose a foul ball machine (like Brett Butler) is pretty valuable,>but I'd rather watch (and root for) the lower OBP guys who can>actually hit the ball.Now *this* is a legitimate point.  Baseball is entertainment, and I have noquarrel with people who find certain styles of play more entertaining thanothers, regardless of their win-value.  Personally, I'm a huge fan of theslug-bunt; I doubt it's a high-percentage play, but I get a big kick out ofit.  I am willing to live with the bad consequences in exchange for the fun.Of course, this is *not* the same as claiming (as some do) that Galarraga'sinability to defer gratification isn't hurting his team because he "isn'tpaid to walk" or "is an RBI guy" or whatever.>And finally, I'd like to point out that many high OBP guys draw >their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike>to them, than because they have a great "eye"I'm not sure.  I used to think this was true, but more and more I'm becomingconvinced that it's the other way around: among players with the physicalability to hit the ball real hard, the patient ones are the ones who get thechance to do it a lot.Let's break down the four basic categories of hitter, according to whetherthey are power threats and whether they walk a lot:PowerNo PowerPatientFrank ThomasBrett ButlerBarry BondsOzzie SmithMark McGwireCraig GrebeckBabe RuthMiller HugginsTed WilliamsBilly HamiltonRickey HendersonEddie JoostJoe MorganMike Hargrove   .   .   .   .   .   .ImpatientErnie BanksOzzie GuillenDave KingmanShawon DunstonJoe CarterAndres ThomasGeorge BellJose LindKirby PuckettDevon Whiteetc.As far as I can tell, all the categories are full.  It really looks like thetwo are independent.  Nobody could possibly be *afraid* of Craig Grebeck atthe plate, and yet he walks quite a lot.  Part of that, undoubtedly, is beingsmall of stature, but surely major league pitchers can hit that sort of target at least 3 times out of 6.  Randy Milligan is an even better example;he's only shown noticeable power for one (partial) season, but he walks allover the place, despite his huge strike zone.--    David M.

His 1988 figure was slightly below average.His 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part ofthat may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with thePadres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, andjudging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to playthird.>Williams, Matt       ----  ----  .633  .653  .656   0.647Add another to the elite fielders list.>Caminiti, Ken        ----  .675  .630  .653  .596   0.642>Sabo, Chris          .751  .626  .616  .613  .575   0.642Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value.

He's never had a good year, but whileat second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielderat third.>Zeile, Todd          ----  ----  ----  .614  .593   0.605Zeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder.  Each year he's about10 points below average.  And it's probably not just the park, since TerryPendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this.>Baerga, Carlos       ----  ----  ----  .604  ----   0.604Moving back to second was a good idea.>Hayes, Chris         ----  .601  .622  .606  .574   0.602So why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?

(A very nice piece of information, Ms. Nichols.  Who knows?She may be listening, and not have me in her kill file after all.)  Thosenumbers indicate somewhere in the neighborhood of half-a-run *less* beingscored per game, and the games taking 15 minutes *longer*.  Something isbeing done now that wasn't done ten years ago, which is extending the gamesby 15 minutes.  Ms. Nichols thinks it's more pitches.  Given the increasingspecialization of pitchers, it wouldn't surprise me.If it's not simply more pitches, though, I don't think it's unreasonableto think that something can be done to get ten of those minutes back.  ThenI get a couple more from shortening the warmup time for a relief pitcherafter he comes in, and a couple more still from enforcing existing rules,which have been stated in other posts in this thread (and other related ones).The problem is, who decides whether that time is "wasted?"  You don't seemto think it is at all.  Right now, I think it is, although I have heard onecase favoring giving the reliever all the warmups he thinks he needs (thedifference in mounds between the field and pen) -- but who knows?  If therules get changed, maybe something I didn't foresee will happen to change mymind.  But you can bet a lot of minds would fail to foresee the same thing,or else nothing will be changed.RG"I can play me better than anyone.

 15A few weeks ago I posted about the Phillies team personalities.  Did anyone see the ESPN feature on the Phils on Monday Night.  John Kruk had a great line.  He was talking about people on the team always playing and not sitting out because of a minor injury.  He said if they do they know we'll kick their ass.  The time I saw in was in the afternoon and it was not bleeped.  When I saw it atthey bleeped "ass."  Mitch Williams talked about the team being a bunch of throwaways from other teams, and that is why they are so close.  Kruk said thatthey all get along this year.  Last year, he said, they hated the pitchers.  I assume he was joking, but he always keeps a straight face when he talks.

 22Nntp-Posting-Host: keynes.econ.duke.eduThe term "stopper" is generally used to refer to a pitcher, onewho can be counted on to pitch a strong game to keep his team from goingon a losing streak.The Braves have plenty of pitchers to fit this description,although right now I'd expect Smoltz or Glavine to take the mantle.What the Braves lack, however, is an offensive stopper,somebody they can look to to bring them out of their hitting slump.There's just no one there.  The Braves got rid of their best purehitter, Lonnie Smith, and only Terry Pendleton on the current rosterhas ever shown more than a cursory ability to hit.Oh, and another thing that worries me.  Ron Gant seems to haveslowed down a step.  That's scary.

 46Like Clinton and Reno, I accept full responsibility for thissenseless disaster.  My wife and I picked this game to go toand thus caused the return of the pre-season-projected Soxoffense.  Like all no-no's Bosio was good, lucky (hard grounderby Vaughn off T. Martinez' glove but straight to Boone who threw to Bosio at first, 3-4-1), and backed by good defense(many non-trivial groundouts).  The game was amazingly fast,as the Sox tended to go down quickly and Hesketh was also working fast.  The Sox relief pitching was ok -- the runs offQuantrill were on two ridiculous bloops and a hard line singlewhich Greenwell let get past him trying for a catch.Greenwell's mental stability is a serious concern (I guess ithas always been, but his quirks were amusing back when he wasan MVP candidate).  Wednesday he got in a huff with Johnson aafter striking out on a bad inside pitch (apparently Johnsonmade an "ok, I've got to stay focused" gesture which Iron Mikeinterpreted as taunting), and struck out to heavy booing the next two times.  As Valentine noted, last night he came up inthe first after Riles and Quintana had walked to open the game.Can you say "take the first pitch"?  Not Mike, who dribbled itinto a 6-4-3.  The PI quoted Bosio that this was a "battingpractice fastball".  Next time up he also hit the first pitch,a hard liner straight to KGJr in center.  He also made thepathetic error and failed to catch Boone's HR (which looked comparable to the ball Lance Johnson caught on the highlightreel that night).Is Riles suppsoed to be good defensively?  I couldn't tell fromthe field angle but his range looked bad, and he coughed a DPthat cost a run or two.  Why was he leadoff?  I hope Fletchergets well soon.Also on lineups, Pinella put Bret Boone fifth for reasons beyondme.  It seemed to work, as he was 3-4 with a HR and some gooddefense (a wag behind us said "He sure don't want to go back toCalgary!")  There is a theory that you put a leadoff type fifthbecause they'll likely lead off the second (as Boone did).Well, now we face the hot Angels and another power pitcher inLangston.  A reminder that contest entries are open through nextWednesday -- I expect a surge of pessimism.  By the way, ties willbe broken by earliest entry.  One entry per person or pseudonym,please, and easy on the pseudonyms.Dave MB

In fact,>it doesn't mean *anything*, because the units are screwy.I agree and disagree.  John is saying that the batters efforts will resultin 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400%does not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I wouldrather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% ineach of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winningby .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obviouspositive association between John's statistic and winning games.  Thus,before you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study mustgo into what sort of relationship there is.>Consider an example:  Bob hits a 2-out solo HR in the bottom of the first;>about .12 on your scale.  He does the same thing again in the fourth, with>the score tied, for another .14.  And again, in the seventh, with the score>tied, for another .22.  And, finally, in the ninth to win the game by a score>of 7-6, for a value of 0.5.  Bob hit 4 solo HR in 4 plate appearances, and>was credited by your method with .12 + .14 + .22 + .5 = .98.  But what does>that mean?  Was Bob 98% responsible for the win?  Certainly not; the defense>is *always* 50% responsible (if you include pitching in that), and Bob wasn't>pitching.  In fact, Bob was only 4/7 of the offense (which is a lot, but not>even close to 100%).  Furthermore, what about the other 3 team runs?  Say>they all came on solo HR by Fred; then Fred was hitting HR to tie up the game,>which are just as valuable as HR to take the lead (see Lindsey), and Fred will>himself have accrued a good .4 rating or so.  So Fred and Bob combined have>amassed 138% of a win IN ONE GAME.  There's clearly a problem here.The only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactlyhow many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over manyseasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some playersperformance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is aplayer who gets an out gets a "negative probability" in most cases.Thus, I'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbersfor a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes,they will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also,the pitchers' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have giventhem a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter thatpulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.  >>Greg thinking about the right things, but his intuition is off the>>mark.  Closers are enormously important.  The total number of runs>>value is outweighed by when they come, or are prevented from comming.>>The doubling which Greg allows is not enough.>>In another article, I proposed a test of this.  We can predict a team's >won/lost record quite accurately by looking at how many runs *total* they>score and allow, without regard to when those runs score in the game.  If>late runs are really more important than early runs, then looking only at>late runs should lead to a *better* predictor, right?No, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I wouldthink however, that the number of runs you score in the first inningwould be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score in the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usuallycomes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to arguethat any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importanceto those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runsoften means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starterwho gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  Theoffence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am notsaying all late inning situations are equally important either.  IfI am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how manyruns my pitcher gives up in the ninth.       >Here's another thought experiment: apply this method to basketball.  What>you find is that points scored in the first *half* of the game have almost>exactly no value, because no lead is safe with an entire half yet to play.>Furthermore, the sub in off the bench who sinks the winning free throws with>no time on the clock gets a +1.0 for the game, while the star forward who >scored 27 points in the first half before spraining his ankle gets a zero.>>Does this make sense?No, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning wouldbe 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look,if you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly highprobability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of theball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers,fouls, bad defense, etc. caused a "negative chance" that the teamwould win. From reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that thosewho critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.At first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it reallydoes not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain playersin crucial situation elevate their performance and others performancegoes down.  I've never seen convincing proof that this really happens.So, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that exceptfor a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association toplayer performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if youdo not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out whatthe average value of a home run is for example.  We may find forinstance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15%on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%.I bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was justas good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.How do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have theexact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K's, BB's,etc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitchedin closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was morevaluble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better pitcher?  They were probably about the same.                                                        Brian Smith

(I don't remember a 30-day, but rather a 21-day.  Anyways, it's gone now.)  The period length is a minimum, not a maximum.  You can keep a guy on the 15-day for as long as you want, IF he's still certified as injured.  The player must be periodically re-evaluated to determine if he's still injured (thus you cannot park a player on the DL who maybe is out of options and you do not wish to expose to waivers).  If you get someone qualified for the 60-day that reduces the frequency of re-evaluations.  There is no longer, I believe, any limit to the number of players you can place on the DL.  When there was, you often had to choose and juggle your injured players between the lists.--King "Sparky" Banaian|"No taxes:  No new taxes,kbanaian@pitzer.claremont.edu|no old taxes, we are taxedDept. of Economics, Pitzer College|enough." -- Rep.

You know the umpire is going to do something(call for a strike, throw you out, etc.).  Gant was wrong.But Hirschbeck was more wrong, in my biased view.  Aside from the major chiphe seemed to have on his shoulder, what was the problem.  Gant had a reasonto want some time (disputed strike call).  Gant hadn't been wasting time allgame.  The game had been cruising along, and was just over two hours old.The score was 1-0, with 2 outs in the ninth and a runner in scoring position.Is there *any* reason Hirschbeck couldn't, and shouldn't, cut Gant a littleslack?

As soon as Larkin threw that ball, I knew thatLankford was a dead bird.  But how could Dent have known that Larkin would makea perfect throw? I strongly believe that Torre is one of the best managers in baseball.  Don'tforget the overachieving Cards of '91 that won all those close games and wentfrom last place to second place (although they were oveshadowed by the Braves/Twins last to first climb).  He won a division title, and barely lost a pennantrace when he was with the Braves (why Atlanta ever even considered firing him Iwill never understand).  With Torre at the controls, the Cardinals are headingin the right direction. One more thing, one game does not make a season.  Yes, they lost to the Reds,but with the second best pitching staff in the National League (first in theEast), and a pretty good offense, the Redbirds will win a lot more than theylose.  Maybe this is the year that they will go all the way.

So far, no takers.Personally, I think Harris is a defensive liability, and hehas also led the team in past years for hitting into doubleplays, or at least been among the leaders. Sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to playevery day, he can get the job done.  If Sharpy played justone base every day, say third, he'd also improve defensively. Wallach has helped tremendously on defense, as has Reed.The improved defense is quite noticeable and is having aneffect on the pitching staff.  Both Astacio AND Martinezwere bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays.Martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that mighthave seen him lifted in the third in past years. Astacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances.The Dodgers are turning double plays, and keeping more ballsin the infield than last year.  And Piazza has also been greaton defense.  He has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying tosteal and has at least one pick off at first. Wallach, clearly, has contributed to the over all improvement ondefense.  But his offense is awful and he has cost the Dodgerssome runs.  But I don't think he is as bad as his current average.I suspect he will come out of this slump much as Davis and Strawseem to have come out of theirs. Dodger

When was winfield's peak years anyway? probably around 85.That's the trouble: *what* peak years?  He wavers between excellent andvery good, with no real bell-shaped pattern in there.  1979 was a fineyear; 78 and 80 were merely really good.  With the Yankees, 84 (I think)was the best; that was the one with the .340 BA.  Of course, 1992 wasn't bad, either.  He's been in the bigs since 1973,with a one-year intermission for surgery.  Though he doesn't have themix of skills that Pete Rose did, he's like Pete Rose in one way: he's not a natural hitter.  Winfield's swing used to be the ugliest thingin New York, and that includes the Gulf+Western Building.  But his sheerathletic prowess and physical size made up for a lot.  Fascinating player to watch, even now.  Not obviously great in any oneway; but able to do quite a few things in surprising ways and at surprisinglevels.Roger

In 1992he hit .264.  Not surprising, huh?  Also in 1992: Non-Clutch: 536 AB144 H.269Clutch:  86 AB 20 H.233No, this doesn't prove any overall statistical trend that canbe used to predict future performance across the breadth of major league ballplayers.

He also gets credit for mentioning that the 1969 jumpin offense was due also to the rules changes after the 1968 season.

And yes,baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves.I suspect that a lot of the complaining about long games, especially whenit's coming from TV people, has to something to do with advertising.Probably time "wasted" in the middle of an inning, say by a batterstepping out of the box to fiddle with his gloves, or by a pitcherwalking around behind the mound trying to collect his thoughts, couldotherwise be sold as advertising time.HeatherHHENDERSON@vax.clarku.edu

His1988 season is pretty decent for a rookie 2B.  The move tothird base explains a lot of his 1989.  When he returned as an OF,he began hitting again.  And of course, last year he slumped.But no learning curve?  He has obviously improved his batting eyeover the years, as well as his SB/CS ratio.  As to his fielding,he was an infielder when he was drafted, a 2Bman as he cameup through the Braves system, and then the Braves put him through2 position changes in the space of a year.  He's an adequate OF,although not great, and at least some of your perception of hisfielding is colored by watching him learn to play the OF at theML level.  (I know you're another long-term Braves fan :)About playing 3B...IMO, that's the 2nd most DIFFICULT positionto field, after catcher.  At SS or 2B, you need more range and speed, but at 3B, you've got to have quick reflexes and have a GUN for an arm.  There are NO second chances at 3B, even whenplaying sandlot softball!  Granted, I'd still put my bestoverall infielder at SS, but that's because he gets morechances, not because the job is harder.  It still amazes methat so many teams have tried to convert other position playersto 3B.  But maybe that's because the supply of "natural" 3B isscarce.Finally, Gant is a player who puts pressure on himself toperform well, and works hard to improve.  You don't getthose amazingly huge arms on that relatively small body without alot of weight work.  Now, whether he's been overdoing it thesedays may be a valid question, as is the question of whetherhe tries too hard to make something happen during each at-bat.But frankly, if a player is going to not live up to potential,I'd much rather they fail by trying too hard, than by nottrying hard enough.  You might be able to teach relaxationto an adult; but at that age I don't believe you can teachhustle.All that said, I don't think I'd sign Gant to another long-termcontract.  He's 28 now, and I think he's free-agent eligiblein 2 years, when he'll be 30.  Given his career curve andlimitations, I wouldn't expect him to last much past 35as a ML ballplayer.  He might surprise me here, but Atlanta'sgot some talent on the farm, and I'd rather take my chancesdown the road with Nieves et al.Eric

The Yankees and Indians, tied for fourth place, had 76 wins.Now I should think it is obvious that the Red Sox improved more thanthe Indians or Tigers.  Basically, the Red Sox are stronger this yearat 1B, DH, SS, LF, and RF.  They have healthier starting pitchers (sofar, at least) and better relievers.  I see no reason why theyshouldn't win ~85 games.  Meanwhile, the Indians are in shambles andthe Tigers *still* have no pitching.

But you cannot know how the team>would have done without Viola.  Your analysis is fallacious.OK, how about a straigh answer, then. Here's a very simele question to whichI'm sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Pleaseanswer yes or no, Roger: Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs?AL only, please.For anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable factthat a team's win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs theteam scores and the number the team allows. It's not a definite,hard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as arule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,for every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.So, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find thatthey scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All otherthings being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced JackMorris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238for Boston), the "Red Jays" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, orenough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn't take into account that Violapitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless youreally do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runshis team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in thisanalysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola wouldnecessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, butthat is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were andevaluate Viola's as better than Morris' in the sense that "had Morrisperformed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.">It takes an open mind to really truly understand what is happening out>here in the real world guys.This is true, but not so open that your brain falls out.

 117Disclaimer -- This is for fun.In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called"stolen hits", defined as a play made that "an average fielder would notmake with average effort."  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages postedby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive statsfor the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as "Plays KurtStillwell would not have made."OK, I realize that's unfair.  Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff,fluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If wereplaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% outmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated NetHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a leagueaverage fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net DoublePlays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, orDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), whichshould represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don'ttake it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of thisarticle.The short version -- definition of termsHS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt StillwellNHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielderNDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielderNEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielderDCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.DOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution.National Leaguename            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPSAlicea, L.      50    21    2    -1    .160    .865Sandberg, R.   108    42    1     1    .134   1.015Thompson, R.    65    20    5    -1    .104    .852Lind, J.        66     8   -2     1    .027    .571Doran, B.       31    -1    4     0    .014    .705DeShields, D.   51     1   -2     1   -.002    .755Harris, L.      25    -4    0     1   -.019    .602Lemke, M.       43    -1   -5    -5   -.038    .573Morandini, M.   37    -9   -6     0   -.069    .580Randolph, W.    13   -16    3    -1   -.088    .582Biggio, C.      34   -26   -4     0   -.091    .656Stillwell, K.    0   -43   -3    -1   -.236    .336Ordered by DOPS1.015 Sandberg .865 Alicea .852 Thompson .755 DeShields .705 Doran .678 *NL Average* .656 Biggio .602 Harris .582 Randolph .580 Morandini .573 Lemke .571 Lind .336 StillwellAmerican League---------------name            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPSFletcher, S.    59    18    5     1    .116    .811Reed, J.        83    17    3     1    .071    .708Ripken, B.      56     9   -1    -1    .044    .631Baerga, C.      67     0   10     0    .029    .838Blankenship, L. 34     2    2     1    .023    .757Miller, K.      34    -4    1    -1   -.016    .725Alomar, R.      62     4   -9    -2   -.020    .812Knoblauch, C.   50   -13    7    -3   -.024    .718Bordick, M.     37    -4   -2    -1   -.025    .704Kelly, P.       42    -1   -5    -1   -.039    .636Whitaker, L.    40    -8   -1    -2   -.041    .806Reynolds, H.    47    -6   -5     1   -.043    .603Sax, S.         56    -6   -9    -1   -.052    .555Sojo, L.        28   -11   -3     0   -.075    .602Order by DOPS.838 Baerga.812 Alomar.811 Fletcher.806 Whitaker.757 Blankenship.725 Miller.718 Knoblauch.708 Reed.704 Bordick.691 *AL Average*.636 Kelly.631 Ripken.603 Reynolds.602 Sojo.555 SaxMore discussion --DCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)/AB)Why such a bizzare formula?

His equivalentaverage started at .253 in 88, was up to .274 in 89 and 286 in 90. Solet us say he had established, in his last two seasons, a .280 levelof play.That is good. Very good, in fact. But it probably doesn't make the topten in the league. The 10th best EQA in the AL in 1992 was DaveWinfield's .296; Thomas was first at .350. First in the NL was Bonds,an incroyable .378; tenth was Bip Roberts, .297. But .280 is betterthan any season in the past five years by Joe Carter; it is about whatMattingly had in 1988 (.285); what Felix Jose had the last two years;just ahead of Time Raines' five-year average; better than RyanKlesko's MLEs. He got more attention from the media than was warranted from hisbaseball playing, though; his hype was a lot better than his hitting.That is the basis for the net.comments about him being overrated. Themedia would have you beleive he was a great hitter. I think he was agood, maybe very good hitter. He was IMO, something like the 30th besthitter in the majors.Clay D.

 49Off and on over the last several months, threads about RBIs andrelated topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can predict a player's RBIs using information about his overallperformance and the number of runners in scoring position (RISP)that he bats with.  In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculatedpredicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This completely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2 could do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought I'dtake that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit tothe data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.I've started with team data, using data from the Elias's thatI've picked up over the years when a) I could afford them andb) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias's profits.That gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.  (I don't have team RBIs for '87 or I could add that year.)  If yourun a simple least squares fit to the data you get (RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.The correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which issignificant at a ridiculously high level.  So, I feel like thefit is good at the team level.  I've no started to move on to the player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark,Ozzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly).  I hope to add quite a few more during my copious free time this year.It doesn't do too badly, except the equation underpredicts thelow HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or itcould just be Ozzie.  The results:                           RBI-HR         Years        Actual   PredictedCarter  (84-88,90)     400       402.6Clark   (87,88,90,92)  269       269.6Matt'ly (84-88,90)     471       460.8Smith   (84-88,90)     317       280.6I think we can make a case (and I hope to make it stronger) thatRBIs can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overalland how many men are in scoring position when he comes up.More later,Harold-- Harold Brooks                    hbrooks@uiatma.atmos.uiuc.eduNational Severe Storms Laboratory (Norman, OK)"I used to work for a brewery, too, but I didn't drink on the job."-P.

When he first mentioned it, I thought he wasjust making a mistake but then he said it over and over.  And then in theexamples from other years, he gave stats for players from both leagues evenwhen only one league expanded.So (since stats *NEVER* lie :-) ), I guess there is an effect on both leaguesbecause the expansion draft takes talent from both leagues equally making every team in both leagues dilute their major league talent by calling upplayers that, normally, they would not have had there not been expansion.Make sense?

 13There are two conflicting reports about a pitcher that iseither in the Jays' farm system or the Braves'. His name is Bill Taylor.He was picked up by the Jays, but had to be offered back to the Bravesbefore they were able to send him to the Syracuse Chiefs.One report says that the Braves took him back and assigned himto Richmond. The other says that he is on the Chiefs' roster. Which one isright?
 22NPR this morning had an interview with Linda McCarthy (name possiblygarbled by me), an official historian for the CIA.  She has won an Emmyfor research on Moe Berg for a TV documentary (which I know from nothingbut which sounds good).  She said that among other things, Berg was the principal spy for the OSS (CIA's WWII precursor) spying on Axis atomicprograms, because of his physics background and language skills.  She saidthat during the war he met with Heisenberg in Switzerland, and had instructions to shoot Heisenberg if the Germans were close to us in bombresearch (he concluded they were two years behind, and didn't shoot him).(I have heard elsewhere that Heisenberg deliberately misled the Nazi bombprogram, but I don't know how reliable this is.)  Unfortunately, NPR didn'tmention any kind of a book she's writing -- I'd certainly buy it.(In case you're wondering about baseball relevance, Berg was a longtimeMLB backup catcher.  He was a member of an MLB All-Star team that touredJapan in 1934, presumably not because of his baseball prowess but becausehe was one of the few Americans, much less MLB players, who spoke Japanese.Photos he took of Tokyo on that trip were later used to plan bombing raids,according to McCarthy.)Dave MB

 36I've been a Giants season ticket holder for years and never really complainedabout the old ballyard place. Sure, it's been cold, the food lines were long,and the hired hands were surly, but this was all part of the Giants mystique.Or so I thought.I went to Tuesday's game (3 - 1 Giants over the Marlins) and the 'Stick was a much different place. Nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind, but everything is a lot better. The lines are a lot shorter, the bathrooms areCLEAN and have running water, and the hired hands were very polite. The new foghorn (lights up and blows after each homerun) and the wooden fenceare very nice, as are the new bleachers. The bleachers start right at the topof the fence and give a great view, and they've got beer stands at thebottome of the bleachers. The only complaint is that the electronic old-fashioned scoreboard looks electronic - could be better.These things should have been done a long time ago, but it took a real businessman (ex - Safeway President Peter Magowan) to figure it out. Just like he used to tell his checkers, "If the customers don't come back, I don'tneed as many checkers". This isn't a knock on Bob Lurie - he was a competentbusinessman but he didn't deal much with the general public.I'll give an example of how the level of service has changed. The onion dispenser jammed as I was using it. An attendant came over, apoligized forthe problem and proceeded to fix the machine. After he was done, he cleanedthe machine and said he was glad to be able to help. In the old days, therewas no attendant and the folks at the concession stands would say "Go tothe stand 100 feet away - they might be able to help".All in all, it was a fun day--Craig Eid e-mail address    craige@hpsad.sad.hp.com

 3My dad has always blamed the Phillies collapse in '64 on me...  On Sept 21,  1964,  the Phillies had something like a 9 game lead with 12 to play.  I was born on Sept 21,  1964.  The Phils proceeded to lose something like 10 straight while the Cards won 10 straight (does anyone know hte exact numbers?),  and a pennant was blown.  To this day my dad likes to remind me that it all began when I was born!KRM

I'm serious; Itend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, butI'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work, if there areany.  I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I canlook up their minor league stats.  (It's important to distinguish betweenplayers who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numberswould have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, butactually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers).  Let's kick it off with an example of a player who was "rushed", althoughthere doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career.  Jay Bell wasgiven 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below whatyou would expect from his AAA numbers the same season.  He got 236 PAs thenext year at age 22, and still underperformed.  However, the next year, atage 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job,and has been there ever since.  It's really hard for me to see where hewould have been better off staying in the minor league (where he wasperformed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being "rushed";Cleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might havebeen less likely to give up on him.Yes, if you bring a player up early, he's likely going to struggle.  Butdoes that delay the time at which he stops struggling, and startsperforming up to expectations?Sherri Nicholssnichols@adobe.com

 10OK, OK, OK. First, my apologies for perhaps being untimely with this subject material and perhaps overly optimistic in my request, but here goes anyhow:I'm *very* interested in finding out how I might be able to get two tickets for the All Star game in Baltimore this year. My very aged folks live about 50 miles away and I know it would be a great thing for them to attend the game. I went with them, and my grandfather who got me into baseball as a small child, to the All Star game in DC many years ago. Although I'm now in the SF Bay Area, I'd *love* to be able to treat my folks to this game; it's absolutely the last chance they'd ever have to attend this game locally.Any info would be greatly appreciated!!!!Mary Colemcole@informix.com

Hence, going to a game is abig deal, like going to a play or an opera.  Maybe you have more money than I do and can go to games all year long, so it's not such a big deal for you.  But I'm not interested in having games "sped up", any more than I want tohave _Die Walkure_ cut down to a convenient "weeknight version" of twohours.

Is it always this way?) then we are going to have trouble finding the> true value of DHs using the same models as that for position players.There are several reasons for this difference.  The main reason is thatgood hitters in their prime (such as Frank Thomas and Danny Tartabull)are rarely regular DH's, even if they can't field; it's more commonly aplace to put aging veterans.Another use of the DH slot is to help a player come back from injuryslowly, getting his bat in the lineup without forcing him to play in thefield.  I would expect such players to hit worse as DH's than they didduring the rest of the season.A third factor is that most player who split time between DH and firstor the outfield don't hit as well as DH's for some reason.  ReggieJackson was a good example; in five years as a RF/DH for the Angels, hehit like the old Reggie when he was in right.The second and third factors will be lost if players are considered bytheir primary position only; a player who plays 90 games in right and 60at DH will count only in the right fielders' averages.> A logical starting place would be to look at defensive replacement> value (if you can find it) for 1B or LF or something.

Although the*average* offensive performance of a DH may be lower than for a leftfielder, the *replacement-level* offensive performance is certainlylower; if you are a left fielder but can't hit well enough to keep a jobanywhere, then you certainly can't hit well enough to keep a job at DH.--David Grabiner, grabiner@zariski.harvard.edu"We are sorry, but the number you have dialed is imaginary.""Please rotate your phone 90 degrees and try again."Disclaimer: I speak for no one and no one speaks for me.

It also said something about being a"polite" alternative to "may."  The presence of "probability, possibility"can certainly be used to partially explain your word selection.  So, I'd say to all extents and purposes, "Yes, you might."

He hasbrought baseball back to Houston with key acquisitions -- players thatwere from the Houston area and wanted to play for the Astros.  I don'tthink that too many people are fearful that McLane will meddle in the teamas he has already admitted that he doesn't know a whole lot about baseball.McLane is a businessman, and doesn't like excuses.  He makes a valid pointthat injuries shouldn't be an excuse to this club.  Look at the depth of thebench this season.. Canadele can play 7 positions; Bass and James are solidoutfielders and can hit well too; Uribe is nice to have as well..  Thepitching staff has 6 legitimate starters.  We're dealing with a youngHouston team, so injuries shouldn't play a big role.  The only threat isthe bullpen -- if Jonesy goes out, we may be in trouble but with thetype of starters we have this season, there is less pressure on the pen.--- --- --- --- --- --- David S.

This has included licensing Spanish fan magazines, encouraging Spanish co-broadcasts, and marketing programs directed at the Latin American community.  One of the biggest heros to the Latin American audience has been Francisco Cabrerra (a fact of which he was slightly embarrassed!).  One funny story is that during Spring Training, the Braves played a game in Mexico.  This game was broadcast back to Atlanta in Spanish.  It took the broadcasters a few innings to get a rythm going because they had to keep changing their location.  Seems it took a while to find a place where they could get a clear signal on their cellular phones through which they were calling the game!

You're right: Thomas, Gonzalez, Sheffield, and Griffey don't even beginto compare with Ripken, Boggs, and Gwynn, so no wonder Alomar gets somuch attention.Sandberg got no attention his rookie year because his rookie year wasterrible.  So was his sophomore year.National League pitchers are "much better pitchers"?  That certainly explainsSheffield's 1993, hm?

 8This talk about the Phillies winning the NL East is scary.  VERYscary!  Don't get me wrong, Im a Phillies fan but as late as lastyear they looked helpless.  The funny thing was they did have a lotof injuries in '92 spring training that basically killed theirchances.  Of course, don't forget the Dykstra wrist injury in thefirst or second game?
 13Once again, the Rockies bullpen fell apart.  Andy Ashby pitched six (somewhatshaky) innings giving up just one run.  Then game the dreaded relief.  Threepicthers combined to give up 3 runs (one each I believe) in the 7th inningand blew the save opportunity.  (Final was 4-2 vs Expos).Despite their problems in the pen, I think the Rockies are a team that wontbe taken lightly.  Going into today's game, the had the league's leadinghitter and RBI man (Galarraga), two of the leaders in stolen bases (Youngand Cole) and increasingly strong starting pitching.-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------David Rex Wood -- davewood@cs.colorado.edu -- University of Colorado at Boulder-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the official scorer balances theofficial score card, they copy it and give it to several diffent people. One of those is a person from AP whose job it is to type it up (using atemplate on a laptop) and transmit it to the AP offices in New York(Rockefeller Center) via the telephone.  The box scores are not checkedand just rebroadcasted over AP's news delivery services.  If there arecorrections, those are issued later.  It is the person sitting in frontof a laptop at Shea (or whereever) whose fault that is.

Maybe the AP person in Denver did this(remember, they just started with MLB out there).

I am astounded atthe number of times people post strong opinions about things they not onlydon't understand but publicly admit to not understanding. In fact, there's aplausible argument that saves are a more rational stat than wins.For the record, there are two ways that a reliever can get a save:He must finish the game and either1. have entered the game with the tying run on base, at bat, or on deck.2. have pitched at least three innings effectively.A pitcher may not get a win and a save in the same game.>I believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in >determining winners/savers/etc.  For instance, a pitcher can come in in the >ninth with a lead, blow the lead, fall behind, have his team come back in >the next half inning and earn the win.

(No offense,> Gordon).I wouldn't give baserunning that much value.The above effect is clear, but there are other effects as well.  IfOlerud hits a double, any runner on first will score; if Alomar legs anextra base onto a hit in the gap, the runner on first may need to holdat third.  Thus Olerud's doubles have more advancement value thanAlomar's.  (Of course, Alomar is more likely to score after hitting adouble.)Another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is thatthe runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams.  Noteam in the 1950's ran much, but some teams certainly had faster playersthan others.  Still, the current runs created formulas work just as wellin the 1950's for all teams.  Bill James gives the 1955-1958 Senators as an example.  They used HarmonKillebrew regularly as a pinch runner, and in 1957, stole 13 bases with38 times caught stealing.  Yet they scored slightly more runs thanpredicted by Runs Created.--David Grabiner, grabiner@zariski.harvard.edu"We are sorry, but the number you have dialed is imaginary.""Please rotate your phone 90 degrees and try again."Disclaimer: I speak for no one and no one speaks for me.
 64The media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday todeath, but I haven't seen anything in rsb yet.Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with twoon and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into theright field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence andwent into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got tothe spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but hemissed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt,reached up and caught the ball.  Home run.Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded thatDarryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentiallybehind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediatevicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered withStrawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fanwho caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was obliviousto where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant assoon as he realized he had made the catch.That exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberrywent into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lotof profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore ofcosting the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurledfood and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadiumofficials started to remove him from the park, but then relented andjust relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game,Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into atirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about winning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who madethe catch.Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speechwherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls thatare hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any that are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he havebeen more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibilityof interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, heis a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocatedhis seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference isimpossible.Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with whatthe fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the firstnine games.I question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pullhitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play,he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilitiesof the fan.--The Beastmaster-- Mark Singer    mss@netcom.com

That's why he lost 18 for Detroit in1990. Funny how he wins a lot of games when he pitches on good teams butloses a lot when he pitches on bad ones. And if "rings" was the onlycriteria for success, then teams would always tend to repeat, andeventually you'd have the same team win the WS every bleepin' year. Sortof like the yanks in the 50s.Morris is a decent pitcher on the downside of a good, not great, career.Toronto will finish 3rd or 4th this year, with Morris and all thoserings, because their pitching staff was destroyed over the off-season.Steve Thornton   stevet@eskimo.com

I don't follow AL, so I won't comment on "Majors". In the NL,if I had my choice of any 1B in the league for my team, it'd be Clark, andI'd hit him third. (My fantasy team has both Grace and Murray on it, becauseI've never been able to GET Clark. I'd take any of the three withouthesitation in real life, but I think Clark is it).Williams: Not even close. I much prefer his defense, but when he isn'theadcasing it, Matt has a good, solid swing and some real punch. If he dropsto .230, then he wanders out of cleanup, but according to the latestBaseball Weekly, he's hitting .275, and in the last week, hitting .296.That's not exactly chopped liver.Mostly, though, the Giants are winning, and frankly, as long as thatcontinues, it's rather silly to second-guess their strategy.

 154Tim Belcher pitched a dandy three-hit shut-out tonight as Cincinnati won their second straight 5-0.  Pittsburgh Lefty Randy Tomlin was hit early and often by the heavily right-unbalanced Reds line-up, which managed somerecently rare power with their bats.Belcher (1-1) was solid throughout and in fact seemed to get stronger as thegame progressed.  Early on he had several three-ball counts, but even thosewere few and far between later on as he allowed only one base-on-balls whilestriking out nine.  In a post game interview he said his change-up was workingfor him--I should say so:  all nine of his strikeouts were apparently on breaking balls.Tomlin (0-1), on the other hand was in trouble early, giving up a second-pitchdouble to lead-off batter Bip Roberts.  Bobby Kelly followed with a single and Barry Larkin scored Roberts with a sharp single to right.  The big guys(Mitchell, Sabo, Milligan) were unable to get anything after that--in factthey all struck out--but Kelly managed a score anyway due to a double-stealand a Tomlin wild pitch.In fact, it appeared that Tomlin was going to recover nicely from his shakystart-- he retired 9 of the next 11 batters to get to the fourth behind only2-0.  Randy Milligan, though, had different ideas as his line-shot waspoorly played by Orlando Merced and turned into a triple.  Milligan would later score on Reggie Sanders' sacrifice fly, giving Cinci the 3-0 lead after 4.The fifth inning spelled loss for Tomlin when Roberts led off with his seconddouble of the game, and one batter later Larkin smacked a double down the left field line, chasing Tomlin.  Barry later would score the final run onTom Prince's two-base passed ball.  The Pirates managed their only threat of the day in the bottom half of thefifth when Merced and Kevin Young hit back-to-back singles (the second being of the "bunt" variety), but Carlos Garcia struck out, Prince fit a foul fly, and pinch-hitter Lonnie Smith "K'd" to end any Pittsburgh hope.Pittsburgh pitchers backed Tomlin up well, though:  relievers Blas Minor,Moeller (sp?), and Nagel gave up only two hits in their four-plus inningswork.Barry Larkin left the game in the seventh when the grounder he (mis)played bruised his right thumb.  He was taken to the hospital for "precautionaryX-rays".  Let's hope he's OK.Cincinnati is now 4-9, still the worst record in the majors, but with thetwo wins they may be looking at  moving out of the cellar!Pittsburgh is now 7-6.*********REDS FANS***************************If you would like to receive this report on a semi-daily basis (as often as I write it), send me your e-mail address and I'll put you on the list.

The event that had the most impact on Gaetti's career was his leg injuryin 1988.  His performance dropped radically from 1988 to 1989.

 30My father is a huge Tiger fan, and I am a loyal Blue Jay fan, who endured the collapse of 87, the heartbreak of 85.  I don't have the stat book, so let's throw them out.First of all, Morris in his heyday (81-88) vs Clemens (86-present).How many Cy Youngs does Morris have?How many Cy youngs does Clemens have?Ballparks and such... Fenway average pitchers park.  Detroit, hugh hittersparadise.   Morris is a great team pitcher, sort of in the Doug Drabek mold.  If Morris's team needs a well pitched game, as in Minn in 91, Morrissnaps the ball, and throw for Ks.  Otherwise, he just tries to get people out.As for Clemens, in the Elias Stat Book of 1992, I believethat Clemens has the best lifetime record for his team, as compared towhen he doesn't pitch.  How bad would the Red sox have been last yearwithout him?  Can you say 92 Phillies?I believe Clemens is the better pitcher because of more power, and hsigreat tenacity.  Morris is among the guttiest pitchers I;ve ever seen,but Clemens is in a class with Seaver, Carlton, etc.  Paul sparks

 27I've been following the Giants closely over the off-season -- newspapers,notesgroup, etc -- but I had my first up close and personal last night atthe Stick.After watching Giants hitters struggle last year, Barry's swing was very impressive -- he's very quick and his swing seems effortless, evencompared to Clark (particularly Clark as of late).It was interesting to see Bonds hit Maddux so well.  I'm not sure ifBarry was after revenge against the Braves or what but he strokedthree very pretty hits (1b, 2b, hr) for 5 rbi's.The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year inaddition to Bonds.  There has been some good pitching and some hittersseem to be swinging much better.  Clayton's defense has been superb.McGee seems to like leading off this year.  Manwaring is driving the ball.So on & so forth.I hope it continues...I think they need to continue well into June beforepeople are really sold that they are for real--particularly the pitching.For myself, I think the fresh start of Magowan/Baker/etc has really wipedout a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factorin helping them significantly improve over last year.Joe Loosloos@cup.hp.com

If he didn't help us win the AL east, forgetabout the pennent and the world series.His run support was high (5.98 runs) but so was Stottlemyer's (5.90 runs)and he won only 12 games.  I do remember Morris winning an inordinate number of6-5 and 8-6 ballgames, but this is to his credit.  He pitched only as goodas he needed to be.  When he was up 6-1 in a ballgame, he just put it in cruisecontrol and threw the ball up there and let the batters "get themseleves out"(I hate this expression!).  An inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down.  But Morris, being a veteran pitcher, knows that winning is the only thing that really matters inbaseball.  By saving himself, he was able to reach back for that little extra(I hate this too!) when the game was on the line.Yes Morris is crapping out big time this year, but let's not change historyto suit the present.  BTW, I think he should be put in the bullpen; it would be embarrassing a veteran pitcher which Cito would never do, but his era is 17+, how much morecan he be embarrassed?> > From where I sit, I'll let others have the excellent players - I'll> settle for good enough and the ring :-)ditto!> > Joe Leonard> jle@world.std.com> eddie

 105Disclaimer -- This is for fun.In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called"stolen hits", defined as a play made that "an average fielder would notmake with average effort."  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages postedby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive statsfor the leftfielders. Hits Stolen have been redefined as "Plays KevinBass would not have made."OK, I realize that's unfair.  Kevin's probably the victim of pitching staff,fluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If wereplaced every leftfielder in the league with someone with Kevin's 49.4% outmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated NetHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a leagueaverage fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, orDCON :->.

Basically, it's designed to be added into theOPS, with the idea that "a run prevented is as important as a run scored".The extra outs are factored into OBP, while the extra bases removed are factored into SLG.  That's why I used PA and AB as the divisors.For more discussion see the post on Hits Stolen -- First Base 1992-- Dale J.

And it isn't because I loathe the Phillysports teams - the Phillies are my favorite NL team (Yanks are favoriteAL), and the Eagles aren't too bad either. There are two big problems:1)Total emphasis on the home teams, especially the Eagles. Unlike  the FAN hosts, who can at least answer a question about an  out-of-town team if a caller asks, the WIP hosts seem   to have no clue about any team that doesn't play on  Broad Street. Also, FANs periodic sports updates (every 20  minutes) gives sports news and scores from around the  country. It's very rare to hear an out-of-town score  being reported on WIP.2)The hosts. With the exception of Jody MacDonald, who I miss  from his days at FAN, none of the hosts really seems to have  both a broad knowledge of the sport or a good on-air presence.  The worst is Gary Cobb, who seems to have been hired solely  on the basis that he used to play for the Eagles.Anyway, that's my two cents on the whole FAN vs WIP battle.-Alan

Haven't been to many A's games, have you?Seriously, I don't mind a baseball game that lasts a long time if it lastsa long time because there is good baseball being played.  However, I don'tlike 3-2 games that take 3+ hours, because there's a lot of dead time goingon in that game.  I don't find anything exciting about watching batter orpitcher wander around between pitches, or watching the catcher make a slowwalk to the mound, or watching lots of pitcher changes for no good reason(Whitey Herzog used to be the master of this; the game could be way out ofreach, and he'd still be making switches for platoon advantage).  I want to see the game, not people standing around.  I don't really enjoywatching NFL football games in person, for example, because there's so muchdead time (you don't really notice how much dead time there is if you watchit on television, because they're busy showing you replays).  I don't likethat college basketball games have so many time outs at the end of the game(the NCAA has made some moves to try to alleviate this problem for nextyear: they're going to stop the clock after made baskets late in games nextyear, and they're going to a 35 second clock).  There's also a difference in how tolerant I am of long games if I'mwatching them on the tube, and if I'm going there in person.  For me, goingto an A's game has become a major commitment of time, one that I'm notwilling to make that often:  the length of their games is costing the A'srevenue from me.Sherri Nicholssnichols@adobe.com

It's amazing how hard it is to get baseballteams to understand how to properly market their teams and treat theircustomers.  No other business could ever get away with the 19th century attitudes that most current owners display in running their clubs.  I guess theowners look at baseball's high growth rate and ask why it's necessaryto bring 20th century business practices into the game, but they don'trealize how much more growth the game is capable of and how much theypay in terms of long-term popularity by not doing better by the gameand its fans.Greg

To rebut my opinion, you have made an analogy with a game of chance.Your hypothesis assumes that the Lotto players have no impact onthe selection of the numbers, and hence their ability to win.Well, that's certainly true in Lotto.

By your line of reasoning, if a guy hits into adouble play with one out and the bases loaded, there's no point in sayingthat that was a bad thing to do (if his team won anyway) or speculatingon what might have happened if things had gone otherwise, so the doubleplay is merely an event that happened in the course of a game that waseventually won or lost for unknown reasons.  After all, any speculationinvolves constructing a fantasy about what would have happened but didn't.Roger, do you ever worry that the next pencil you drop will fall to theceiling instead?  Or are you willing to consider empirical evidence?Teams go to the post-season when they win more games than anybody elsein their division.  If they don't make the post-season, they don't win theSeries.  Will you agree that winning a division is a useful intermediategoal in ring-collecting?If so, you must agree that winning games is a useful intermediate goaltowards winning the division, and our disagreements come when we considerhow to win games.In your viewpoint as expressed, winning games happens for reasons thatcannot be analyzed.  While many of us are thinking things like "Base-runners are good, outs are bad, and therefore walks are better thandouble plays with the bases loaded", you are thinking things like"It's a team game, so perhaps the double play will cause some mysteriousteam dynamics that will cause the team to win today".The result is that it becomes impossible to say *anything* about individualplayers.  Perhaps Atlanta would have won the Series with me playing leftfield.  After all, perhaps in some way my knowledge and personality wouldhave helped the team more than my complete lack of skill would have hurtit.  Therefore, I could be an extremely valuable player.  Did Dave Winfieldhave anything to do with the Jays' victory?  Probably, but how do you know?If you replace him with Andres Galarraga, perhaps the Jays would have won,perhaps they would have lost, perhaps they would have defected to AlphaCentauri (bearing in mind that the flying saucers would not have landedin mid-season had Winfield been DHing for Toronto).Was Babe Ruth a good player?  He played on some WS-winning teams, but didhe have anything to do with their success?It is generally accepted that Ernie Banks was a good baseball player, andJarvis Brown and Dan Schatzeder weren't.  It seems to me that anybody whowould deny this needs to provide the proof.Now, we have observed things about baseball over the years, both empiricallyand by looking at the rulebook.  It is necessary to score more runs thanone's opponent to win the game, so it would seem important to score runsand to prevent one's opponent from scoring.  Runs are scored while a teamis batting, and an inning ends after the third out, so it would seem thatmaking outs is bad while hitting home runs is good.  Players have tendenciesto hit or pitch at certain levels, and these are usually somewhat consistentfrom year to year.We do use these statistics to predict winners, and so do you.  To makesome flat predictions:  Barry Bonds will have a higher OBP+SLG thanGene Larkin this year.  The Braves will finish ahead of the Rockiesin the standings.  The Tigers will score more runs than the Royals, butwill also give up more.  I would be astonished if any of these turnedout to be false, and, I suspect, so would you.  As a matter of fact, Iam pretty sure I can predict all the division winners this year, given3-4 guesses per division, and this is certainly better than randomchance (and almost statistically significant).If you will admit that the Rockies and Mariners are unlikely to meet inthe World Series, you must admit that there is some sort of way to measurelikelihoods, however fuzzy.>>It is impossible for all other things to be equal so your fantasy is totally>meaningless.>So how about "real life"?  Person A robs a service station with two peoplein it, using a .38 automatic pistol, gets $42, and is convicted and sentencedfor three years.  Person B, with a similar criminal record, robs a servicestation with two people in it, using a .38 revolver, gets $42, and isconvicted.  Since they used two different types of handgun, are comparisonstotally meaningless?Say you drop a pencil to see if the gravity still works (my cats are alwaystesting this - they don't trust me to pay the gravity bill on time).

I do actually quote some thingsthat Roger Meynard wrote, but it might be better to think of this as"sampling" his post (in the hip-hop sense) because it fits in with whatI want to say.maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca (Roger Maynard) writes:>But the point is that the only decision making pro->cess  used to determine the "best" is the score of the game and it re->lates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method>inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that>is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.There's an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseballteam and some people's conception of a biological organism.  In thebiology context, we would very likely read "fitness" for "the score ofthe game" and "organisms" for "teams".  How we interpret "players" istrickier, but either "organs", or "genes" might seem reasonablechoices depending on what point we were trying to make.  A "genes"interpretation actually might be really interesting in this case, but that would be a different and probably longer post.If, however, we take the "organ" view, then our knowledge of biologyshould make us pause before we start saying things like "species X ismore fit than species Y because of a better organ Z".  Given what weknow about the interdependence of organs, we would often be suspiciousof such claims.  (But note that this type of argument is quite oftenmade when you map "species X" onto 'humans', and "organ Z" onto'brain').  On the other hand, some statements of this kind do seemmore reasonable than others, as far as we can test them (e.g. 'brain'above might be more reasonable than 'pancreas' assuming no grosspathology, particularly if species Y is a primate).Even when you make such statements, you should be concerned with thefunctioning of the whole organism, and the possibility that one organmight be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another.(Not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucialin some third species.)  However, if we are non-vitalists with anykind of reductionsit streak, we will want to say that an organism isnot some completely magical unanalyzable "whole" but an intriguingprocess made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that arepotentially observable.  Some of these processes might be localized toparticular organs, while others may be distributed across multipleorgans.  In a way, this is just like a baseball team, except that Ithink it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involvedin baseball are *much* simpler and less numerous than in most organisms.>To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab->solutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B>in their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.One thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectlycontrolled experiments are sometimes very tough to do.  But, ofcourse, this has never stopped researchers from doing the best theycan, and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in theabsence of certainty.  Most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation,but even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research.>If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens>has done better [than another pitcher] with those statistics as a>criteria, then fine.In this cases, we're seeing the word "statistics" means "summary ofobserved events", where the events themselves can be viewed as theoutput of some process, and possibly inputs for other processes.Thus, if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put togetherinto the functioning organism, data in the form of statistics mightgive us a basis to test particular hypotheses.>But you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the>individual's contribution to winning the WS - because that is the only>measure of "best" that has any meaning in the context of baseball.This statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again.Fitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment;you might be fit in one situation and not another.  Moving tobaseball, it is clear that each team spends the entire season in anenvironment including all the other teams in the league.  In at leasta nominal sense, the division winners are the fittest teams in theleague, in that they (on average) had better fitness scores than anyof their competing opponennts.  But in a real sense, there is a fairlylarge random component in the performance of each team that isdifficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factorsintrinsic to (or interesting for) baseball.  The same is true inbiology.  But here is also no direct biological equivalent of theWorld Series in basebal.  In the world series, the random componentmay be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played,and both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environementwhere they were originally successful.  It might be fun to watch, butit's unclear what it all really means.***Now just one more un-related point:>I have yet to see that any of you can predict a>WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.On the other hand, you have seen some of us who can predict theoutcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment ofteams to finishes, and maybe some of us (e.g. me) who can do thisbetter than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis.But this is probably only due to the fact that a 162-game schedulegives you a little hope that bad hops aren't the only differencebetween the winners and the losers.Moreover, you've had the opportunity to see some analysis of the WorldSeries situation that makes the strong claim that *nobody* can predictthe WS winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased onlyto reflect the well-known home vs. road effect on winning percentage.>The stats are a nice hobby and that's about it.  There is no new>knowledge being produced.  Since stats are summaries of events, it's true that if you know theevents you can derive the stats.  But if somebody is trying tounderstand the process behind the stats, then the stats produce newknowledge, and some of this might even be reliable, repeatable, anduseful.  Speaking of which, I should get back to producing knowledgein a different field.  That is, of course, if I can produce knowledgeeven though I'm relying on stats to do it.jking

I'd rather see runs scored as the result of sound hitting and sound baseball strategy rather than on the sloppinessthat could result from this kind of rule.  So, I suppose there are somedisadvantages to that idea too.>|> Baseball games take about 2:51 in the NL, and just a shade under 3 hours>|> in the AL.  That's just too damn long.

That may be a little harsh for the majors, but seriously, how about putting a limit on the batters being able to step out, take several dozen practice swings, poundtheir shoes, scratch their balls, etc.?  Maybe forcing them to stay in thebatter's box wouldn't be such a bad idea.  That could save a few minutes.--Randy

 7As the heading indicates, it is impossible for me to fathom why Barry is notbatting 4th for the Giants behind Will Clark.  Barry is such an awesome andconsistent hitter -- definitely the best in the National League.  IMHO, to have Williams, a streaky hitter (and not really a clutch hitter) batting4th ahead of Bonds is simply an injustice to the Giants and fans of theGiants.

 31NNTP-Posting-Host: prism.cs.orst.eduHi there,      I was wondering if anyone knew if John Wetteland was put on the DL again      after his first 15-day period was up? I read in the USA Today Sports       section that he is on for "surgery to repair broken toe", and was      wondering if that was new. I thought he was just letting it heal.       Another question, Is Derek Lilliquist the main closer for the Indians now      that Olin is gone. I need to know cause I need to find a reliever to       replace Wetteland and so far Lilliquist is doing ok. Any information on      either of the players would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your      time.       Ryan Robin.___________________________________________________________     [==================]         Texas Rangers in 1993!

 57I thought I'd post my predicted standings since I find those posted by othersto be interesting.  Sorry this is after Opening Day.  I certify that thesewere completed before the first pitch. :-)AL East1.  New York Yankees - the most (only?) improved team in this division2.  Toronto Blue Jays - Stewart and Morris?  No way.3.  Milwaukee Brewers - they always seem to do better than I expect4.  Baltimore Orioles - Pitching, but Devareaux, Anderson, and Hoiles will drop5.  Cleveland Indians - Still don't seem to know what they are doing6.  Detroit Tigers - All key players but Fryman are another year past peak7.  Boston Red Sox - Any team with Clemens and Viola might be beter than 7thAl West - this division was the toughest for me to pick.  Whoever of the top          4 gets pitching should win it.1.  Minnesota Twins - young pitchers seem to have best chance for success2.  Texas Rangers - I don't know why I have them here.  Jose Canseco?3.  Chicago White Sox - Frank Thomas but no pitching.4.  Oakland A's - LaRussa is the best manager and would keep any team close5.  Seattle Mariners - I like Pinella, but don't see much here6.  Kansas City Royals - will score no runs7.  California Angels - will win no gamesNL East1.  Montreal Expos - good all around, plus no Wallach!2.  St. Louis Cardinals - (Jeffries + Whiten) >> (Jose + Clark), no Galarraga3.  Pittsburgh Pirates - youngsters will take up more slack than expected4.  New York Mets - some good players, still not a "team"5.  Philadelphia Phillies - they don't impress me6.  Florida Marlins - they know what they're doing7.  Chicago Cubs - they don't know what they're doingNL West - The 2 best teams in baseball are in this division.1.  Atlanta Braves - Awesome starters, but offense could be a concern2.  Cincinnati Reds - Would not surprise me if they won it all3.  Houston Astros - Any team that signs Uribe won't contend. Closer to 4 than 24.  San Diego Padres - Plantier could be the Sheffield of 19935.  Los Angeles Dodgers - better pitching than the Giants6.  San Francisco Giants - because the Rockies just stink7.  Colorado Rockies - will become the Seattle Mariners of the NL.NLCS  Montreal d.

Or Darrell>Evans! Yeah, yeah! After the Hall of Fame takes in them, it can take in>Eddie Murray and Jeff Reardon.Oh, yeah.  Dave Winfield--marginal player.  Guy didn't hit a lick, hadnegligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield,now entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decenthitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime,he had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don't know where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman aresimilar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn't field,he ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, hisOBP wasn't THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important)was a absolute-primo-dick.  Eddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's.  I know thatMVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of theMVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media.  Lee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one's actually pretty close.  He's had a ssolid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks (Wrigley, Fenway...).  I'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been a while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.  You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers,simply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you blow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month)Atlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one, the Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should HomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.Darrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda likeTed Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF'er.>     Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody>giving Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards,>marginal.Lemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN'T marginal?>Honestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there. They're both>shortstops that just hung around for a long time. Big deal.>Let's be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors so>liberally. Save them for the guys who really deserve it. Face it, if somethingNow, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED theposition of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he's won something alongthe lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a good argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's morerecent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early80's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie'soffense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of hiscareer, depressed offense, admittedly, no power ('cept against Tom Niedenfuer:-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.Yount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a realstiff.  His '82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory,and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far asSS numbers go.  He's a clear HOF'er, IMHO.>isn't done, there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore. When >certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential >candidates, the absurdity is apparent. Gee, can these guys even compare to>the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?Well, as far as Garvey goes, you're right.  Garvey is a "mediot" candidate, pushed because of his "winning attitude" (a minor factor, if oneat all), and his "great defense" (no errors, admittedly, but the range ofa tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn't be in the HOF.SkyJack?  I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the lastyear or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talkabout Morris' "ability to win" which is nothing more than Morris' "abilityto pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs".  At this point, Morris is anaverage pitcher (although from his early returns in '93, he may be damned close to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the80's for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great yearfor Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, butnot favorites.  Morris' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF"consideration".  Ryan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone willthrow back your earlier logic about "Yount and Smith being shortstops who hung around a long time".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he's just pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre...(Of course, Nolan's a HOF'er...)Puck?  Probably, although he's got to play reasonably well for a fewmore years (10 years, even good ones, aren't enough to make the HOF, mostlikely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty muchregardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY tragic or sudden).  He's very popular in the media and with fans, andlegitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined theleague.  I've always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in theend, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it's too early to sell.This debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it or not, I never tire of it.

 26Nntp-Posting-Host: mail.sas.upenn.eduBuck Showalter just can't win. Bob Wickman's pitching the game of his life through eight innings (Yankslead 6-1), so Buck decides to let the kid try and get his first completegame. Wickman manages to get two outs, but in between, four funs score,and all of a sudden it's 6-5, and Wickman just can't get the third out.So Buck goes to the bullpen, and Farr gets out the first guy he faces.Last night, Jimmy Key is pitching another in a long string of games of hislife (this guy just keeps getting better!) through eight innings (Yankslead 4-0). This time, Buck thinks, "I don't want a repeat of thatnear-fiasco with Wickman, so I'll give my bullpen some work." Steve Howe,whose ERA was 54.00 coming into the game, left with it at 81.00. He didn'tdo too good. Then Farr comes in. He gives up a two-run homer, and theRoyals win it, 6-5.What's going on? This is already the third or fourth time this year thatthe bullpen has blown a lead. Farr & Howe have done it twice together,Monteleone's done it once, and I think even Habyan did it once. What's thedeal? We finally have terrific starting pitching, so all of a sudden, ourbullpen turns to shit!What's Buck gonna do? And what's George gonna do if this continues to happen?-Alan

I won't claim to split hairs and say that we can reallymeasure who was better, Robby Alomar or Carlos Baerga, last year; thedifference is too close to call. But Larkin and Lee? Clemens andMorris? The differences are too great there.In your measure of the game, why should a team that has just won itall ever replace a single player? Since they are now clearly "best",how can they do better? Yet every team can always find someplace wherethey beleive they can improve the team; they can always find a playera little better than one they already have. (BTW, by my definitions,the "best" player is the one who does the most things to help his teamwin. I will allow that this could vary depending on who else is on theteam, by having aptitudes one team needs more than others.)Baseball is a team game, but it is made of individual talents. It isabsurd to judge the success or failure of an individual by the successor failure of his teammates, whom he did not choose (at least in mostcases.) Morris won last year because he played on a team with JoeCarter, Robby Alomar, Tom Henke, Juan Guzman, John Olerud, et al.Clemens lost because he was surrounded by such lesser performers asHerm Winninham, Luis Rivera, and Jeff Reardon. To define the qualityof the team as a sum of its components (as I do, albeit imperfectly)is a lesser error than defining the quality of an individual as themean quality of the team (as my reading of your arguments suggests youdo)Clay D.

That's what MajorLeague Baseball and the networks are trying to address when they talk ofshortening the game.  It's because of T.V. not because "football has moreaction than baseball".=========================================================================Steve Conroy|conroy@terminus.saic.com|  "I'm gone, man - solid gone! |Science Applications|-BalooInternational Corporation|=========================================================================

The Red Sox are leading 4-1 and Clemens has just givin up a hit. So,there is a man on first, the batter, and the batter on deck could tie the gamewith a homer.  If Jeff Russel came in, (The Red Sox reliever), and finished thegame without allowing the tieing or losing run to score, he would get the saveand Clemens would get the win.

It appears that ina neutral park Bo's HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses twohome runs).  Or do they?  What is "equivalent average?"One thing, when looking at Bo's stats, is that you can see that KC tookaway some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go fordoubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter youexpect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed, hit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect hisvalue to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.  > That is good. Very good, in fact.

Note: I hadn't realized the media had hyped him so much.  I thought hewas always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so at baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn'twinning.Note 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is amistake being made (by the SDCN's, as they are known, on this group)with respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).We find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past majorand minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well.Their are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction;the lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recentthe player has left college ball, etc.Now of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of "error."  Sometimesa player with poor MLE's (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star.Some hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don't (OddibeMcDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there arereal reasons why Oddibe didn't hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows)involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and liftingand so on.But still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well.One of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common backgroundof the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players isthat all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playingball.  Their backgrounds are similar.What hasn't been established is what happens when you encounter a playerwith a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that aBo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or soon, has such a different background, that the standard model and standardassumptions fit this person slowly?It hasn't been established that you can use MLE's with two-sport players.(It hasn't been established that you can't, but then statistics is, afterall, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continuallymake completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton."Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers," they say.  Well,what happens if those numbers simply don't mean what they usually mean?It might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston thanTuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year inAtlanta than Greenville.  Then again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tankthis year, live up to those poor MLE's.  But you guys DON'T KNOW.  What's worse, you don't know that you don't.  And you don't know that there are other players you won't know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties again.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.  It's not.It's got some error.Oh well.Bill Guilfordstill thinks "hairy butt is truly ugly" might be right

 30  Well, after suffering from an intense fit of Minnesota-induced cabin fever,I've decided to road trip to Milwaukee and take in a couple of games thisweekend. A couple games at County stadium will be great to relieve tension, but I thought "Why not go to Wrigley for a game too?"    I see the Cubs are playing the Phillies on Sat (2:05 start, I believethat's Eastern time listed). I figured it would be fun to bounce down toWrigley for the day game and live it up a little. I'm wondering if anyone(esp. Cubbie fans) have some advice on:   1) If I'm taking 41 (Skokie Hwy) south until it runs into 94, what's the      best way to get to Wrigley? I'm planning on getting there an hour or       two early and paying through the nose for parking to keep things easy.   2) Is it probable that I'll be able to walk up and get bleacher seats (2 or     3) on game day? I figure since it's early in the year, Ryno's out and      the weather isn't great I should be able to get tickets. If not, what's      the best way to get advance tickets; can I call the Cubs' ticket office     directly and pick up tickets at the will call window?    3) Any advice on where to eat before or after the game?   4) Do they allow inflatable I-luv-ewe dolls (present from Lundy) into the      bleachers? :-)  -- Dave Hung Like a Jim Acker Slider Kirsch      Blue Jays - Do it again in '93 kirsch@staff.tc.umn.edu                        New .. quotes out of context!"Not to beat a dead horse, but it's been a couple o' weeks .. this  disappoints me..punishments..discharges..jackhammering.." - Stephen Lawrence

 17ATTN: Those who live inthe Philadelphia Metro area...Back in September I was listening to WIP, and I remember the morningguys were talking with Mayor Ed Rendell.  The topic of conversationwas a new ball park for the Phillies.  The location for this new parkwas suggested to be near 30th St Station.  At the time, the mayor wasoptimisitic that in the future this could become a reality.  Hasthere been any new news on this subject or is it still a pipe dream?I know the city of Philadelphia has other projects ahead, such as thenew convention center and the upcoming Spectrum II.  But it would benice to see this a reality.  It is planned that the Phillies leavethe VET and leave it solely to the Eagles (and if that's the case,the Eagles should make the VET a grass stadium, but that's anotherstory).  I want to see that day!comments?

 17Don't you GUYS think so?  I mean, c'mon!  What the heck are women doingeven THINKING of getting into baseball.  They cause so many problems.  Justlook at Lisa Olson.  Remember that feisty reporter that entered the NewEngland Patriots locker room?  She started crying like a LITTLE GIRL!  Ijust don't think women belong in a man's sport.  Before you smart guysflame me for this, I know the given example was about football.  Who cares? It still applies to other MALE sports.  How can we have women umpires? Jeez!  Look at Pam Postema.  Just because she's a woman, everybody on theface of the earth thinks it's great that she's getting an opportunity toump.  If you even watched the games and had an IQ greater than that ofroast beef, you'd see that she is not nearly as good as most AAA umpires.Besides, she is probably more worried about cracking a fingernail with afoul tip off of Wade Boggs' bat. Or Jose Oquendo's bat. Either way, thereare too many complications.Austin Jacobs (Bob Knepper Fan Club Member #12)

I for one am glad to see this happen, (!!!!)I agree that Hirschbeck was just doing what he was instructed to doand also that Gant should have listened to him.  However, what is with thispolicy of trying to speed up the games.  You are the first person ( non-mediot ) I have seen endorse this policy.  I have no problem with thelength of games at all and am tired of the ESPN crowd ( and other announcers )bitching about it.  I have never been in a ballpark filled with people lookingat their watches and shouting "Hurry up!"  If I cough up big bucks for a ticket, I don't mind a game that last more than 2:10.  I really don'tunderstand it.  Games are longer now for several reasons:  more pitching changes,more basestealing ( and throws to first ), etc...I think a very small factoris the increased time it takes Jose Canseco/ Deion Sanders/ [insert fancyshowboat ballplayer here] to arrange their jewelry prior to stepping in thebatter's box.  My impression is that sportcasters and writers have made thisan issue because they like shorter games - they get to head back to hotelbar, eat steaks, get drunk, tell stupid jokes with their pals and chasestewardesses around the bar.  Sure they want the game over with.  Print journalists have a slightly more legitimate reason for wanting faster games:they have deadlines.  The ESPN guys on baseball tonight drive me crazy - theyconstantly harp on this - primarily because they often have to work late when the game goes longer than 2:30.Maybe I am just a ne'er-do-well with nothing better to do, but I would like to hear reasons why the longer games upset you.As a parenthetical note, it seems the league is in any case fightinga losing battle this year.  The increased offense thus far will certainly spoil any hopes of getting the games over with more quickly.Nick Flynn

A solid hitter, a decent fielder and more importantlya teacher, ask Pat Kelly.

 25In-Reply-To: dtate+@pitt.edu's message of 20 Apr 93 17:31:58 GMTTotal Baseball, which also tries to evaluate a player's total offensiveand defensive contributions, gives Barry Bonds a Total Player rating of9.0 for 1992. Only one other player since Ruth attained that mark: CalRipken for his 1984 season. Rounding out the top five offensive playersin the NL last season: Sheffield, 5.9; Sandberg, 5.8; Van Slyke, 5.3; andLarkin, 4.7.The top 5 offensive players in the AL in 1992 were: E. Martinez, 4.8;Ventura, 4.8; Anderson, 4.5; R. Henderson, 4.4; and Thomas, 4.4In short, Total Baseball says Bonds enjoyed one of the best seasonsever in the game's history -- better than any year had by Mantle,Mays, Williams, etc. (If you disagree, don't flame me; flame thewriters of Total Baseball.) Also, Martinez and Ventura are neck andneck, so given the shortcomings of any statistical analysis, which onehad the better year can be considered a toss-up. Thus, Total Baseballsupports your choices of Bonds and Ventura as the MVPs of 1992.----------------------------Phil Brown                |aka pb6755@csc.albany.edu |--------------------------

 29Boy, hats off to any Cubs fan who can actually muster up the courage to putdown Braves fans.  I mean, all the Braves have done is gone to two consecutiveworld series.  Also, being the Cubs fan that I am, I really have to hand it toall the Braves fans out there that are capable of driving me crazy with thatinfernal cheer that they have.  However, I do have to protest anyone saying that all Cubs fans are stupid.  Theway I see it, either I'm just too stupid to acknowledge it, or that observationwas just plain wrong.  You might have us confused with Bear fans. ;)Anyway, about a two weeks ago just about everyone was saying that the Cubswould finish up last in their division.  (Even behind Florida?!?  Sheesh!)  These same people were predicting the Braves to clean up in their respectivedivision.  Well,  we're ten games into the season and these people are a littleless vocal now.  I wonder why.Well, the way I see it, the East is up for grabs, and whoever wants it most isgoing to take it, with the exception of Florida.  Every team seems to havegood batting and pitching, with Philly presently leading the pack.  But, I justhave to point out, if the Cubs do take the East, they'll do it without thebenefit of a competent manager.  However, and it pains me to say it, thepennant is going to go to the West.Just had to get that off my chest.Docbembenefit of a compee

I don't pretend to understand>statistical analysis.>Well, we agree on the last part.:-)  One of the basic things you need to have in a statistic to be able to predict a player's performance on itin the future is for there to be a correlation from year to year.  A player's batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year.A player's ability to walk or infielder's Defensive Average are correlatedbetter.  That is to say, given their past performance in those statisticswe can have a pretty good handle on how they'll do next year.  Put in some simple information about aging and you can do even better.  One of the basic problems with something like "clutch" batting average - overallbatting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero. Adding to the sample size doesn't seem to help much.  As a counterexample to what you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987:               Non-Clutch                      Clutch               AB      H       BA              AB      H       BA Maldonado      1060    260     .245            254     78      .307Lemon          1643    457     .278            256     57      .223If you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those "clutch"situations, you'd bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye.  Well, in 1988, Maldonado hit .267 in "non-clutch" and .190 in "clutch", while Lemonhit .254 in "non-clutch" and .313 in "clutch".  Before you accuse me of completely cooking the data, there were 96 players who had 25+ "clutch"at bats every year from 1984-1988 (according to Elias).  As a simplemeasure of clutchness, let's just look at clutch BA-non-clutch BA. If you use '84-'87 to predict '88 for those 96 players, you'd find that 27 of the96 were below league average in that measure both in '84-87 and in '88,26 were above league average in both periods and the other 43 were above in one and below in the other.  If you were just flipping coins,you'd expect to get 24 above/below in both and 48 that switched.  Thedifference between the observed results and the coin flip experimentis not statisically significant.BTW, correlating players' _overall_ batting average from '84-'87 with'88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant atsomething better than the 99.9% confidence level.  Correlating their(clutch-non-clutch BA) for the same period gives a correlation of 0.088, significant at no level of any interest.>>>>       Everyone would agree (I hope) that a grand >>slam in the bottom of the ninth when your team is down by three>>is a VERY clutch hit.

Notethat I am *not* (yet) saying that it has anything to do with thequestion at hand.Suppose we have a simplified Lotto game.  You pick a number from 1-10and win if that number is drawn.  Suppose we have a large populationof people who play this game every week.In the first year of the game, approximately 1/4 of the populationwill win 7 or more times.In the second year of the game, 1/4 of those 7-time winners will againbe 7-time winners.In the third year of the game, 1/4 of those who won 7 or more times ineach of the first two years will win 7 again.Suppose I started with 1024 people in my population.  After threeyears, I have 32 people who have consistently, in each of the lastthree years, won 140% or more the number of times expected.Do we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game?No.  Because we know there is no skill involved.  Nothing about these"consistent winners" can influence their chances of winning.  Butsuppose we *don't* know whether or not there is a chance that skillmight be involved.  Perhaps some of the people in our population arepsychic, or something.  How would we test this hypothesis?We can look for correlations in the population.  Now most of thepopulation will show zero correlation.  But our psychics should show ahigh positive correlation (even if they aren't very good psychics,they should still manage to win 7 or more times most years).  Netresult?  A small positive correlation over the entire population.>This probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having>with others on this topic.  Must any conclusion based on statistical>history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before>it has any validity?  Is it impossible (or irrational) to apply>statistical analysis to selected components of the data base?Well, zero correlation is zero correlation.  You mention that Sabo hashit poorly in the clutch over the last 3(?) years.  But if we look atthe past, we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverseas they are to remain consistent.  The length of the streak doesn'tseem to make a difference to the probability that the player will beclutch or choke the next year.  Is there any reason to expect *this*streak to be different from past streaks?Now if it were true that "75% of all three-year streaks remained trueto form", then we might have something useful.  But then we wouldn'thave zero correlation.  Instead we have "50% of all three-year streaksremain true to form, and 50% of all three-year streaks reverse".  Youlook at those numbers and say "three year choke streak implies morelikely to choke this year".  But it would be equally valid to look atthose numbers and say "three year choke streak implies more likely tobe clutch this year", since the probabilities are split 50-50 eachway.>I completely accept that reasoning.  Again, what if we were to find>the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent>basis? Then we would have something useful.  And we would also have apositive correlation.  But for every individual that exhibits such apattern and holds true, there is another who exhibits such a patternand then reverses.Cheers,-Valentine

 139Nntp-Posting-Host: bruchner.biochem.duke.eduSince I was the one responsible for these divergent threads ofapprox. 40+ posts (going back to: The Braves could be better offif an injury happens), I may as well inject a little morefuel to the flame!1)  Back at the beginning of Spring Training, I thoughLopez would make the squad easily.  Olson was stillrecovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe),and there were questions as to whether he would beable to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.I was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopezcan hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he wasthe Braves "Defensive Catcher" prospect, while Brian Deak wasthe Braves "Offensive Catcher" prospect.  Besides, Olsonand Berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboardbox, and don't walk enough to be useful.But Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves wentwith the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been downat the start of the season, he wouldn't have gotten his job back.2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around.After all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear andtear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher(California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying tomove Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.Plus, you'd have to eat that salary, which isn't huge, but isn'ttiddleywinks either (I think Olson's at about $800,000, Berryhillat $450,000, but that's only what I recall).3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role toplay in this also.  What is it, that 5/6 of the 2+year playersaren't eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1/6 that were on the rosterthe longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change,but the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a businessstandpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/thefirst time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL.4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn't on the team.I still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves,and the truth is that I'd rather see our best team on the field,which, IMO, includes Lopez.Of course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won't need him. ;)As for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation, I imagine it wentlike this:  (Remember, they've BOTH been GM's)(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)Cox:  OK, we've sent Jones down.  His fielding could be alittle smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fieldingis better than it used to be.Schuerholz:  Well, we'll have to send Nieves down too.  Deionjust won't sign that baseball only contract.  We can't counton him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for thedefense.  Besides, Gorman's not ready to give up onBilly Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher's gone AND Deion signs,we can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought togive us some pitching depth in 1995.Cox:  Yep, that'll be nice.  Too bad Deion won't sign.OK, I'll look for Nieves when Justice starts havingBerry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what aboutKlesko?Schuerholz:  Well, we've still got to fork out another 1.5 milfor Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the moneyor Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell,but somehow he doesn't seem to be the same GM.  FirstJeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If hegets rid of Brian Jordan, then I'd HAVE to believe that heand Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!Cox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I'll wait til the tradingdeadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a fewextra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California...if Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid.And if that doesn't work, then perhaps Sid's kneescould be "persuaded" to act up.  There's always the15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!Schuerholz:  What about Caraballo?Cox:  Well, he's not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he startsin Richmond, he'll start walking more.  Besides, if he's going to bearbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actuallyget some value from him before he makes the big bucks.Schuerholz:  Now, let's see.  That leaves Lopez.Cox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn't think Olsonwould recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti intorunning into him again?Schuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he'll get$3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that oneextra year.  Besides, until Olson's shown his stuff a littlebit, I can't trade him.  Besides, Berryhill's a left-handedhitter.  You know how rare that is?Cox:  Don't you mean a left-handed whiffer?

Surelyone of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then Ican call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant!THE WORLD SERIES!  I'll be up there with John McGraw!  CaseyStengel!

He'sgot Lankford at third with Todd Zeile I believe - a hot hitter - coming up - there's no reason to risk giving Lankford the go sign in that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the stands.  It's his job to watch the play develop - he should have known Larkin was there to back up a bad throw.  That seemed inexcusable in my book.  BTW, I saw Dent do the same thing last year with Zeile rounding third and going into a sure out at home in a critical situation.  On the replay, there's Dent waving him around.

There is only one way of determin-ing "best" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  atthe  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the bestthat day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  themost  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine thebest of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro-cess  used to determine the "best" is the score of the game and it re-lates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no methodinherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And thatis how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-solutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player Bin their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens hasdone  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But youhave  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   theindividual's  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is theonly measure of "best" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base-ball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham-pionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub-jective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you canpredict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.>The fact is that Morris didn't "win" any ballgames, Toronto did, in>spite of Morris' "contribution".   This has been explained to youExactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  withClemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens.I am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totallymeaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based onhis ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.>many, many times and you are either too stupid or too stubborn to grasp it.You don't have to be rude.>You are completely consumed by the post hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy.For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire pointof  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - IgnoratioElenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   becausehe   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimedthat in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   anindividual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose ofcomparing that individual's performance with another individual's per-formance.The stats are a nice hobby and  that's  about  it.  There  is  no  newknowledge being produced.

How do you know that the Sox areresponding to them, and not to Al Bumbry, Hobson, or (my most likelysuspect) new hitting coach Mike Easler? I certainly am more likely to giveEasler credit for Mo Vaughhn's hot start than Clemens or Viola.>2. Greenwell is hitting as he did before his injuries.This was the optimistic scenario, but not unreasonably so. He hasn't shownmuch power yet, though.>3. Dawson is providing the leadership and some hitting they need from him.How can you tell that Dawson is providing the leadership? Perhaps it'sCalderon? Perhaps it's Clemens and Viola? Maybe Hobson is finally showingthose people skills he was supposed to have when they hired him. Or maybeit's all a myth. And Dawson has been hitting reasonably well, but not aswell as Greenwell, Vaughn, Cooper, or Fletcher.>4. Russell is finishing well.In three games. Why don't we look at this one again in, say, July?>5. Fletcher is hitting well as a leadoff hitter.A bit better than could reasonably have been expected. But don't forget thatZupcic looked like Wade Boggs lite for about 75 AB's last year. Beware ofsmall sample sizes. Still, if Fletcher hits as well as he did last year he'dbe a great improvement over any Sox leadoff hitter from last year. Be awarethat his career numbers seem to indicate that he puts up good numbers aslong as he doesn't have to make more than 300 AB or so in a year.>6. Cooper is hitting well (I think he'll be better then Boggs in the field>and just as good at the plate)Ummm...sorry, no. I can buy the "in the field" part, and I think he'll bebetter at the plate than the 1992 Boggs, but in general Cooper, while he'llbe a pretty good hitter, couldn't carry Boggs' jockstrap. With a littleluck, he could be the fourth or fifth best 3B in the AL (Martinez, Boggs,Ventura, and Palmer will all be better).>If the sox Pitch like last year (they have a better pitchiong staff, now)>and hit like they are so far, they coiuld run away with thee division. but>since I think that their hitting and pitching may not be up to the challenge>of running away with the division, I think that they win be over .500 and at>least Third if not Second or First.See, here is where you make that quick left turn off into the aether. .500is plausible, third is not unlikely, but phrases like "could run away withthe division" are likely to get you a visit from the men in the whitecoats. It's not really clear that their staff is better than last year. IfRussell does well, Darwin doesn't go on the DL, and Hesketh doesn't pitchjust barely well enough to avoid losing his spot in the rotation, they couldbe better. On the other hand, if Hesketh pitches miserably and they're toostupid to move him to the pen and bring up Conroy or somebody, Fossascontinues to pitch dismally but they keep giving him innings becasue he's alefty, and Russell explodes they could be pretty bad.

Anoutfielder who is fast and gets a good jump would be expected to catch alot of balls, preventing both singles and doubles, and also cut off moreuncatchable balls, turinging doubles into singles.  However, a fielderwho plays shallow will catch more short flies and fewer long flies; thismeans that he will allow fewer singles but more doubles.Has anyone seen these players' positioning?  Do Butler and Felix playdeep, and Lankford, Martinez, and Wilson shallow, or is this a parkeffect?  I thought Butler liked to play shallow.--David Grabiner, grabiner@zariski.harvard.edu"We are sorry, but the number you have dialed is imaginary.""Please rotate your phone 90 degrees and try again."Disclaimer: I speak for no one and no one speaks for me.

Was I not specific enough?Just because someone consistently pulls the ball does not mean thatthey have a quick bat.  Dawson's release is slow, and he *IS* 38, afterall.  He may swing early, and rotate his hips so that he hits the ball to the left side all the time, but he swings slowly.As for me disagreeing with Peter Gammons... Whoa!  That's never happenedbefore!

 30During the local Rockies broadcast the other day Don Baylorwent out to bring in a relief pitcher and a graphic came upon the screen that it was the "so and so sponsored" pitching change. I saw another game where the pinch hitter was sponsored.At other times during the game Rockies announcer Duane Kuiper wassetting up the strategy that the defense might use with the expectationthat Charlie Jones would jump in and discuss the situation. Butwhat does Charlie do, he read's a beer advertisement and leavesDuane hanging. Duane's strategy proved prophetic.These examples happen over and over on radio and T.V. braodcastsmaking them sometimes very boring to listen to.I guess it's just a matter of time before a player sells his nameto  Budweiser, Nike, etc.I don't think it will be long until we hear: "Nike Budweiser drillsit deep to left field, Chevrolet goes back, back, it's gone!
