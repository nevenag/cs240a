I saw this doctor for a problem with recurring pain.He suggested medication and a course of treatment, and told me that Ineed to call him 7 days after I begin the medication so that he maymonitor its effectiveness, as well as my general health.I did exactly as he asked, and made the call (reaching his secretary).I explained to her that I was following up at the doctor's request,and that I was worried because the pain episodes were becoming morefrequent and the medication did not seem effective.The doctor called me back, and his first words were, "Whatever you want,you'd better make it quick.  I'm very busy and don't have time to chit-chat with you!"  I told him I was simply following his instructions tocall on the 7th day to status him, and that I was feeling worse.  I then asked if perhaps there was a better time for us to talk when hehad more time.  He responded, "Just spit it out now because no time isa good time."  (Said in a raised voice.)  I started to feel upset andtried to explain quickly what was going on with my condition but mynervousness interfered with my choice of words and I kind of stutteredand then said "well, never mind" and he said he'll talk to variouscolleagues about other medications and he'll call me some other time.This doctor called me that evening and said because I didn't expressmyself well, he was confused about what I wanted.  At this point Iwas pretty upset and I told him (in an amazingly polite voice consideringhow angry I felt) that his earlier manner had hurt my feelings.  He toldme that he just doesn't have time to "rap with patients" and thoughtthat was what I wanted.  I told him that to assume I was calling to"rap" was insulting, and said again that I was just following throughon his orders.  He responded that he resented the implication that he felt I was making that he was not interested in learning about what hispatients have to say about their condition status.  He then gave methis apology: "I am sorry that there was a miscommunication and youmistakenly thought I was insulting.  I am not trying to insult youbut I am not that knowledgeable about pain, and I don't have a lot oftime to deal with that."  He then told me to call him the next dayfor further instructions on how do deal with my pain and medication.I am still upset and have not yet called.My questions: (1) Should I continue to have this doctor manage my care?(2) Since I am in pain off and on, I realize that this may cause me tobe more anxietous so am I perhaps over-reacting or overly sensitive?If this doctor refers me to his colleague who knows more about the typeof pain I have, he still wants me to status him on my condition butnow I am afraid to call him.--Marlena

"Situs inversus" means that organs are on the wrongside of the body, and can be complete or partial. It is interestingmedically because the normal location of organs is caused in partby the "normal" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that inabsence of this, laterality can be "random." People with situsinversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of theirrarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when theycan't find the patient's heart sounds (because they're on the wrongside). According to Harrison's, immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomalrecessive, which should imply that on average one child in fourin a family would be affected. But there may be much more currentinformation on this, and as usual in medicine, we may be talkingabout more than one conditiion. I would suggest that you ask yourpediatrician about contacting a medical geneticics specialist, ofwhich there is probably one at NCSU.-km

I never had younger siblings myself, and when I went on thepediatric wards I suddenly found myself confronting all sorts of infectiouschallenges that my body was not ready for. Pediatrics for me was three solidmonths of illness, and I had a temp of 104 when I took the final exam!I think what happens is that during training, and beyond, we are constantlyexposed to new things, and we have the usual reactions to them, so that lateron, when challenged with something, it is more likely a re-exposure for us,so we deal with it well and get a mild illness. I don't think it is thatthe immune system is hyped up in any way. Also, don't forget that thehospital flora is very different from the home, and we carry a lot of thataround.-km

All I can say is that I will not consume it.  [...]   In the September 1992 issue of THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY DIET AND NUTRITION   LETTER, there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners.  What   follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.   [Reproduced without permission]   The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,where a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed underthe tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,presumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than ifa person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a groupof 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, andsugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest afterdrinking the artificially sweetened beverage.   The study received widespread media attention and stirred agood deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public.However, its results were questionable at best, since the researchersdid not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite didactually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do notnecessarily go hand in hand.   In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examiningthe effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.And after reviewing every one of them, the director of theLaboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns HopkinsUniversity, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-sweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase inthe amount of food eaten afterward.   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causingcancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for ahost of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the governmenthas received thousands of complaints accusing it of causingeverything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.Still, years of careful scientific study conducted both before andafter the sweetener's entering the market have failed to confirmthat it can bring about adverse health effects.  That's why theCenters for Disease Control (the government agency charged withmonitoring public health), the American Medical Association'sCouncil on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administrationhave given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, aclean bill of health.   Granted, the FDA has set forth an "acceptable daily intake" of50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceedthe limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to takein 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans ofaspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,or 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...A 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligramsof the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cupsof yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame contentof selected foods omitted]   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay awayfrom aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder calledphenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000to 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essentialamino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a childconsumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately causesuch severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people withPKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and otheraspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning "Phenylketonurics:Contains Phenylalanine."-Rich Young (These are not Kodak's opinions.)

How is it transmitted?>How does it work (ie. how does it kill so quickly)?There are many organisms, viral, bacterial, and fungal, which cancause meningitits, and the course of these infections varieswidely. The causes of bacterial meningitis vary with age: in adultspneumococcus (the same organism which causes pneumococcal pneumonia)is the most common cause, while in children Hemophilus influenzaeis the most common cause.What you are describing is meningitis from Neisseria meningitidis,which is the second most common cause of bacterial meningitis inboth groups, but with lower incidence in infants. This organismis also called the "meningococcus", and is the source of thecommon epidemics of meningitis that occur and are popularized inthe press. Without prompt treatment (and even WITH it in some cases),the organism typically causes death within a day. This organism, feared as it is, is actually grown from the throatsof many normal adults. It can get to the meninges by differentways, but blood borne spread is probably the usual case. Rifampin (an oral antibiotic) is often given to family and contactsof a case of meningococcal meningitis, by the way.Sorry, but I don't have time for a more detailed reply. Meningitisis a huge topic, and sci.med can't do it justice.-km

Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me,I only eat fruit, vegetables, and whole grain or bran cereals.  Iestimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat.Very little sugar or salt.Very high fiber.  Most Americans get about 10 grams.  25 to 35 arerecommended.  I get between 50 and 150.  Sometimes 200.  (I've heardof people taking fiber pills.  It seems unlikely that pills cancontain enough fiber to make a difference.  It would be about aslikely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills.  Tablets arejust too small, unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.)My "clean your plate" conditioning works *for* me.  Eating the last10% takes half my eating time, and gives satiety a chance to catchup, so I don't still feel hungry and go start eating something else.I don't eat when I'm not hungry (unless I'm sure I'll get hungryshortly, and eating won't be practical then).I bike to work, 22 miles a day, year round.  Fast.  I also bike tostores, movies, and everywhere else, as I've never owned a car.I estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day.  It also helpsbuild and maintain muscle mass, prevent insulin resistance (diabetesruns in my family), and increase my metabolism.  (Even so, mymetabolism is so low that when I'm at rest I'm most comfortablewith a temperature in the 90s (F), and usually wear a sweater ifit drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excessounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products thatweigh slightly less than others.  But it's easier and cheaper to trimweight from the rider than from the vehicle.)There's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radicallydifferent from that of most people who have never been fat.  Fortunately,it isn't different in a way that precludes excellent health.Obviously, I can't swear that every obese person who does what I'vedone will have the success I did.  But I've never yet heard of one whodid try it and didn't succeed.> I think all of us cycle.  One's success depends on how large the> fluctuations in the cycle are.  Some people can cycle only 5 pounds.I'm sure everyone's weight cycles, whether or not they've ever been fat.I usually eat extremely little salt.  When I do eat something salty,my weight can increase overnight by as much as ten pounds.  It comesoff again over a week or two.-- Keith Lynch, kfl@access.digex.comf p=2,3:2 s q=1 x "f f=3:2 q:f*f>p!'q  s q=p#f" w:q p,?$x\\8+1*8

Reproduced without permission.]Digression 6.1:  Miracle Berries and the Modification of Taste ReceptorsAlthough the _miracle berry_, a plant native to West Africa is practicallytasteless, it temporarily changes the taste of other substances.  Miracleberries contain a protein, _miraculin_, that modifies sweet receptors insuch a way that they can be stimulated by acids (Bartoshuk, Gentile, Moskowitz, & Meiselman, 1974).  If you ever get a chance to chew a miracleberry (and I do recommend it), for about the next half an hour all acids (which are normally sour) will taste sweet.  They will continue to tastesour as well.Miraculin was, for a time, commercially available in the United States as adiet aid.  The idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculinpill and then eat and drink unsweetened, slightly acidic substances.  Suchsubstances would taste sweet without providing many calories.A colleague and I once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berries.We drank straight lemon juice, sauerkraut juice, even vinegar.  All tastedextremely sweet.  Somehow we forgot how acidic these substances are.  We awoke the next day to find our mouths full of ulcers.[... continued discussion of a couple other taste-altering substances ...]Refs:  Bartoshuk, L.M., Gentile, R.L., Moskowitz, H.R., & Meiselman, H.L.

The cockpitcrew (pilot) limits are somewhat more stringent than the cabin crewlimits for this reason.  Crew rest requirements address amount of timeon duty plus rest time.  A tired crew is an accident-prone crew.The only limits I know of for inner-ear problems are in militaryaircraft, which are frequently unpressurized or less reliablypressurized.  Not being able to clear the ears renders aircrew membersDNIF (duties not involving flying) or grounded until the ears clear.Flying can accentuate problems if ears don't clear.  If you don't havebig pressure changes, you may not know that you've got a problem.  Butif you zip up to 5,000 or 6,000 ft (the usual cabin altitude in anairliner) and then back down to sea level, you may discover a problem.Ears don't clear readily because of allergies, colds, infections, andanatomical problems.  The last won't change; the first three can.Medication (decongestants or antihistimines, usually) can help.Chewing gum, sucking hard candy (or a bottle for babies),yawning--these will help all four causes.--Mary Shafer  DoD #0362 KotFR NASA Dryden Flight Research Facility, Edwards, CAshafer@rigel.dfrf.nasa.gov                    Of course I don't speak for NASA "A MiG at your six is better than no MiG at all."

As I understand it,the hernia is a relatively minor problem, though I do occasionallyhave some nasty heartburn that is probably related to it. The Schatzkiring, on the other hand, is causing swallowing difficulty. In particular,if I'm not careful about eating slowly, and thoroughly chewing food,food occasionally gets "stuck" before reaching my stomach. This resultsin a period of painful spasms as the food attempts to pass the obstruction.Fortunately, the food has always managed to pass, but this is annoying,and causes frequent discomfort.My doctor wants to "dilate" the ring using thefollowing procedure: use an endoscope to examine the esophagus and stomachfor any inflammation, then cut through the ring and dilate it by passingsome kind of balloon or something thru the esophagous. I would like to knowif anyone out there has had this (or a similar) procedure done-if so,was it painful, successful, etc. Also, can anyone  comment onsafety, advisability, and success rate of this procedure? Has it becomea common procedure? I am kind of leery of having such an invasive-soundingprocedure performed for a (currently) non-threatening condition such as this,especially considering the possible side effects (bleeding, perforation,reaction to anesthesia).The second issue: for the past 3-4 years I have had a large numberof "extra" heartbeats. In particular, during the past month or so therehas been a dramatic increase-a Holter monitor recently showed 50 PVC's in 24hrs, along with a few PAC's. (Many days, there are far more than this,however-five to ten per hour). All of them were isolated, and the cardiologistindicated that such a number was "normal". It certainly doesn'tfeel normal. In the past there have also been a couple of episodes ofextended "runs" of these beats, one of which lasted long enough to causesevere light-headedness. I am relatively young (30-ish), thin and in goodhealth (recent bloodtests were all normal), and do not smoke, use drugs orcaffeine, etc. I'm willing to accept the extra beats as "normal", but don'twant to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom. The numberof PVC's seems to increase throughout the day, and with exercise (or somethingas simple as climbing some stairs). Also, if I get up after sitting or lyingdown for a while, I tend to get a couple of extra beats. Could they possiblybe related to the esophagous problems? Both seemed to develop at about thesame time.Thanks for any help/advice!==============================================================================================================================================================

There are non-surgical ways,however, to keep the ostia open (however, in a few individuals, theirostia are naturally very small), and Dr. Ivker's book talks about this.The underlying cause of chronic sinusitis is NOT cured by this kind ofsinus surgery, though.About asthma, that's a little more controversial.  Dr. Ivker, in his book,"Sinus Survival", *speculates* (and says it's not proven), that many casesof asthma are triggered by chronic sinusitis due to the excessive drainage(postnasal drip) from the sinuses.  He's had many patients who've foundrelief from asthma when the chronic sinusitis is reduced or eliminated -not clinical proof, but compelling anecdotal information of this speculation.Before doing any sinus surgery, first get THE BOOK - it discusses surgery,as well as a good non-surgical treatment program for chronic sinusitis.Jon Noring-- Charter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.If you're dying to know what INFJ means, be brave, e-mail me, I'll send info.=============================================================================| Jon Noring          | noring@netcom.com        |                          || JKN International   | IP    : 192.100.81.100   | FRED'S GOURMET CHOCOLATE || 1312 Carlton Place  | Phone : (510) 294-8153   | CHIPS - World's Best!    || Livermore, CA 94550 | V-Mail: (510) 417-4101   |                          |=============================================================================Who are you?

Aunt Millie often getsinto the conversation, as in "they ignored Aunt Millie's headachesfor years", and then she died of a brain tumor, aneurysm, orwhatever.  If you can get away without ever ordering imaging for apatient with an obviously benign headache syndrome, I'd like to hearwhat your magic is.Every once in a while I am able to bypass imaging by getting an EEG.Mind you, I don't think EEG is terribly sensitive for brain tumor,but the patient feels like "something is being done" (as if thehours I spent talking with and examining the patient were"nothing"), the EEG has no ionizing radiation, it's *much* cheaperthan CT or MRI, and the EEG brings in some money to my department.--- .

Afterward on a one-on-one basis, I asked the speaker what if none of the Vancanese, Beconase, Nasalide, Nasalcort, or Nasalchrom work nor do any oral decongestants work.  She replied that she saw an article on Vasomotor Rhinitis.  That this is not an allergic reaction and that nothing other than the Afrin's and such would work.

In the examples I've seen, drugs weredefinitely involved. My own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in thehospital. He was fifty-three at the time, and he was on 21 separatemedications. The family protested, but the doctors were adamant, tellingus that none of the drugs interact. They even took the attitude that, ifhe was disoriented, they should put him on something else as well! Withthe help of an MD friend of the family, we had all his medicationdiscontinued. He had a seizure that night, and was put back on one drug.Two days later, he was his old self again. I guess there aren't manymedical texts that address the subject of 21-way interactions.I don't mean this as a cheap shot at the medical profession. It is anaspect of hospitals that is very frightening to me. Docs seem to believethat, because they have close control of you, it's quite all right totake your bodily equilibria into their own hands. That control reducesthe chance that the patient will make a mistake, but health careproviders can make mistakes too, and mistakes can be deadly under thosecircumstances. I grant you that sometimes there's no choice. Nevertheless, I suggestyou procure a list of the drugs your grandmother is getting, and discussit with an independent doc. Her problems may not be the effect of HALDOLat all. HALDOL may have been used validly, or it may have beenprescribed because OTHER medication confused her, and because thehospital normally prescribes HALDOL for the confused elderly.Just my opinion,-Larry (obviously not a doc) C.

And, much as it discomforts us, inhumans a trouble-free birth process was sacrificed to increased brain andcranial size.  Wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans do.Domestic horses and cows typically have a worse time.  To give you an idea:my family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great-great-grandfathers had several wives, and we never could figure out which wifehad each child.  One might ask why this happened.  My great-great-grandfathers were, by the time they reached their forties, quite prosperousfarmers.  Nonetheless, they lost several wives each to the rigors ofchildbirth; the graveyards in Spencer, Indiana, and Boswell, North Dakota,contain quite a few gravestones like "Ida, wf. of Jacob Liptrap, andbaby, May 6, 1853.">You wanted>to section all women carrying breech in case one in a hundred or a>thousand breech babies get hung up in second stage,More like one in ten.

But it is often fatal, when it happens out ofreach of adequate help.  More often, it permanently damages one's health.Clearly women's bodies _evolved_ to give birth (I am no believer in divinedesign); however, evolution did not favor trouble-free births for humans.  >You have your kids where you want. You encourage your wife to>get six inch holes cut through her stomach muscles, expose herself>to anesthesia and infection, and whatever other "just in case" measures>you think are necessary.My, aren't we wroth!  I haven't read a more outrageous straw man attackin months!  I can practically see your mouth foam.We're statistically sophisticated enough to balance the risks.  AlthoughI can't produce exact statistics 5 years after the last time we lookedthem up, rest assured that we balanced C-section risks against other risks.I wouldn't encourage my wife to have a Caesarean unless it was clearlyindicated; on the other hand, I am opposed (on obvious grounds) to waitinguntil an emergency to give in.And bear this in mind: my wife took the lead in all of these decisions.We talked things over, and I did a lot of the leg work, but the maindecisions were really hers.>But I for one am bothered by your continued>suggestions, especially to the misc.kidders pregnant for the first>time, that birth is dangerous, even fatal, and that all these>unpleasant things are far better than the risks you run just doing>it naturally.I don't know of very many home birth advocates, even, that think thata first-time mother should have her baby at home.>I'm no Luddite.

My wife wasunwilling to take any significant risks in order to have nice surroundings.In view of the intensity of the birth experience, I doubt surroundingshave much importance anyway.

A recent rough testshowed a gently sloping loss to 10-20db down at 1000cps. Then it falls offa cliff to 70-80dbs down from 1500cps on.  This type of loss is difficultto fit. I am currently using some old siemens behind the ear aids whichkeep me roughly functional, but leave a lot to be desired.Recently I had an opportunity to test the Widex Q8 behind the ear aids forseveral weeks. These have four independent programs which are intended tobe customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed. Ifound them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was aboutto go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial ofanother programmable system called ReSound.Unfortunately I was only able to try the ReSound aids in their office forabout 30 minutes and I couldn't compare them 'head to head' with the Widex.Nevertheless, it did appear to me that they were superior and I wasimpressed by what I was able to read about the theory behind them which Iwill give in a separate posting. They also carry the Widex aids and had onepatient (presumably wealthy) who decided to go ahead and get the ReSoundeven though he had purchased the Widex only 6 months ago.The problem is that the ReSound aids are about twice as expensive as theWidex and other programmable aids. I could take a trip to Europe on thedifference!  Being a lover of bargains and hating to spend money, I amhaving a hard time persuading myself to go with the ReSounds. I wouldappreciate any opinions on this and other hearing aids and projectionsabout when and if I might see improvements in technology that aren't quiteso expensive.-Rich Haller <rhaller@ns.uoregon.edu>   University of Oregon, Eugene, OR,USA

In addition, there is one school of thoughtthat contends that oxidative stress rather than arylation of proteinis the more critical factor in the hapatotoxcity of acetaminophen.  As far as drug toxicities go, acetaminophen has and continues to be oneof the most intensely scrutinized. An excellent recent review of the topiccan be found in: Vermeulen, Bessems and Van de Straat. Molecular Aspects of Paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity and itsMechanism-Based Prevention. Drug Metabolism Reviews, 24(3) 367-407 (1992).(Acetaminophen is known as paracetamol in Europe)I couldn't agree with you more about what an awful way to die a toxicdose of acetaminophen causes.  I've heard a number of descriptions byphysicians associated with poison control centers, and they describe alingering very painful death. -Gary-

Interesting statements, simply because I have been told otherwise.  I'mcertainly not questioning Steve's claims, as for one I am not a doctor, and Iagree that foods don't bring on the recurrence of Crohn's.  But inflammationcan be either mildly or DRASTICALLY enhanced due to food.Having had one major obstruction resulting in resection (is that a good enoughcaveat :-), I was told that a *LOW RESIDUE* diet is called for.  Basically,the idea is that if there is inflammation of the gut (which may not berealized by the patient), any residue in the system can be caught in the foldsof inflammation and constantly irritate, thus exacerbating the problem.Therefore, anything that doesn't digest completely by the point of commoninflammation should be avoided.  With what I've been told is typical Crohn's,of the terminal ileum, my diet should be low residue, consisting of:Completely out - never again - items:o corn (kernel husk doesn't digest ... most of us know this :-)o popcorn (same)o dried (dehydrated) fruit and fruit skinso nuts (Very tough when it comes to giving up some fudge :-)Discouraged greatly:o raw vegetables (too fibrous)o wheat and raw grain breadso exotic lettuce (iceberg is ok since it's apparently mostly water)o greens (turnip, mustard, kale, etc...)o little seeds, like sesame (try getting an Arby's without it!)o long grain and wild rice (husky)o beans (you'll generate enough gas alone without them!)o BASICALLY anything that requires heavy digestive processingI was told that the more processed the food the better! (rather ironic in thisday and age).  The whole point is PREVENTATIVE ... you want to give yoursystem as little chance to inflame as possible.  I was told that among theNUMEROUS things that were heavily discouraged (I only listed a few), to trythe ones I wanted and see how I felt.  If it's bad, don't do it again!Remember though that this was while I was in remission.  For Veggies: cook thedaylights out of them.  I prefer steaming ... I think it's cooks morethoroughly - you're mileage may vary.As with anything else, CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR.  Don't just take my word.

She was upset because hercondition had been misdiagnosed since last fall, and she has been ill allthis time.  During her most recent doctor's appointment at her parents'HMO clinic, she said that about FORTY! x-rays were made of her kidney.When she asked why so many x-rays were being made, she was told by atechnician that they need to see the area from different views, but shesays that about five x-rays were made from EACH angle.  She couldn't helpfeeling that something must be wrong with the procedure or something.  Sheis a pre-med student and feels she could have understood what washappening if someone would have explained.  When nobody would, she gotworried.Also, she is told that thre are 300! surgery patients ahead of herand that they cannot do surgery until August or so.  It is now April...She is supposed to rest a lot and drink fluids.  But she has to go toclasses.  She wonders why they have given her no medicine.  She plans tocall back her doctor's office / clinic and try to get answers to thesequestions.  But I told her I would also write in to sci.med and see what Icould find out about why there were so many x-rays and whether it seemso.k. to wait in line 3 or more months for surgery for something like thisor whether she should be looking elsewhere for her care.  She does plan toget a second opinion, too. I will pass info on to her.  It never hurts to get informationfrom more than one source.  You can e-mail me or post.Thanks.Alice

An episode begins with extremetiredness followed by:1. traveling joint pains and stiffness affecting mostly the elbows,knees, and hips.2. generalized muscle pains3. tinnitus and a feeling of pressure in her ears4. severe sweating occuring both at night and during the day5. hemorrhaging in both eyes.

Many tests have been run and all are normal except for something called unidentified bright objects found on a MRI of her brain.  The onlything that seems to alleviate one of these episodes is prednisone.  Attimes she had been on 60 mg per day.  Whenever she gets down to 10-15 mgthe symptoms become acute again.She is quite concerned because the retinal hemorrhages are becomingworse with each episode and her vision is suffering.  None of the docs shehas seen have any idea what this condition is or what can be done to stopit.  Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.  Kathy Turner

Gaucher's disease symptoms include: brittle bones (he lost 9  inches off his hieght); enlarged liver and spleen; internal bleeding; and fatigue (all the time). The problem (in Type 1) is attributed to a genetic mutation where there is a lack of the enzyme glucocerebroside in macrophages so the cells swell up. This will eventually cause death.Enyzme replacement therapy has been successfully developed and approved by the FDA in the last few years so that those patients administered with this drug (called Ceredase) report a remarkable improvement in their condition. Ceredase, which is manufactured by biotech biggy company--Genzyme--costs the patient $380,000 per year. Gaucher's disease has justifyably been called "the most expensive disease in the world".NEED INFO:I have researched Gaucher's disease at the library but am relying on netlanders to provide me with any additional information:**news, stories, reports**people you know with this disease**ideas, articles about Genzyme Corp, how to get a hold of   enough money to buy some, programs available to help with   costs.**Basically ANY HELP YOU CAN OFFERThanks so very much!Deborah

Also getting the adulationof many who believe his is their only hope (if not of cure,then of control) and seeing his name in publications put outby support groups, etc.  This is a definite temptation.-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, andgeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon." ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Without knowing more it is notpossible to say whether the obstruction is permanent due to scarring,or temporary due to swelling of inflammed intestine.  In general, there areno dietary limitations in patients with Crohn's except as they relateto obstruction.  There is no evidence that any foods will bring on recurrence of Crohn's.  It is important to distinguish recurrence fromrecurrent symptoms.  A physician would think of new inflammation as recurrence, while pains from raw veggies just imply a narrowing of theintestine.

New Data Show About 100 Major U.S. Water Supplies Vulnerable ToMilwaukee-Type Disease Outbreak To: National Desk, Environment Writer Contact: Erik Olson or Sarah Silver, 202-783-7800, both          of the Natural Resources Defense Council   WASHINGTON, April 14  -- Internal EPA data releasedtoday by the Natural Resources Defense Council reveals that about100 large water systems -- serving cities from Boston to SanFrancisco -- do not filter to remove disease-carrying organismsleaving those communities potentially vulnerable to a diseaseoutbreak similar to the one affecting Milwaukee.   The EPA list is attached.   "These internal EPA documents reveal that the safety of watersupplies in many American cities is threatened by inadequatepollution controls or filtration," said Erik Olson, a seniorattorney with NRDC.  "Water contamination isn't just a problem inBangladesh, it's also a problem in Bozeman and Boston."   "As of June 29, 1993, about 100 large surface water systems onEPA's list probably will be breaking the law.  The 1986 SafeDrinking Water Act requires all surface water systems to eitherfilter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they usefrom pollution," Olson continued.  Some systems are movingtowards eventually implementing filtration systems but areexpected to miss the law's deadline.   Olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is alreadya reality in other cities.  A 1991 survey of 66 U.S. surfacewater systems by water utility scientists found that 87 percentof raw water samples contained the Milwaukee organismcryptosporidium, and 81 percent contained a similar parasitecalled giardia.   Adding to the level of concern, a General Accounting Officestudy released today by House Health and Environment SubcommitteeChairman Henry Waxman indicates serious deficiencies in thenation's system for conducting and following through on sanitarysurveys of water systems.   "This new information raises a huge warning sign that millionsof Americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and beassured that their water is safe to drink.  We must immediatelyput into place programs to protect water sources fromcontamination and where this is not assured, filtration equipmentmust be installed to protect the public," Olson noted.  "The timehas come for many of the nation's water utilities to stopdragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water fromcontamination; consumers are prepared to pay the modest costsneeded to assure their water is safe to drink."

The fact that the world was round was well known when he set sail.  It was also well known that the circumference was about 25K miles, and that you could not reach Asia bo going west with current technology -- you would neither be able to carry enough supplies, nor get a long enough stretch of good sailing weather.  Nobody thought he would fall off the edge of the world.  Instead, they expected him to die at sea. Columbus thought for no good reason that the circumference was only 16K miles, making the trip practical. Unfortunately for Columbus and his shipmates, the Earth's circumference is indeed 25K miles. Fortunately for Columbus and his shipmates, there was a stopping place right about where Asia would have been had the circumference been 16K miles.

Today hesmoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot!  He used a strange techniqueI'd never seen before.He took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil.The tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray,made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges.In the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similarquantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of twoteabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few cloves.On top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, withtwo chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assemblywent on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes.Later, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprisesand concerns me are:1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from?2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel color    (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring    agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected    it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive,    caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still being    used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what?3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated    as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract    from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever    happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey tea    could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do    so.WRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now, as it happens),I've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangytaste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recentlystopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips,getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process,then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips.My theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weightstuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sortof larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time afterthe initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff,just leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct?I also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat drippingon the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and becauseit covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grillnon-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like thisduck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coalsat one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on thefloor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the firein that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals.And yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is thatsmoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, containsnitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actuallyhas some standing, don't know about the others.An amusing incident I recall was the Duncan Hines scandal, when it wasdiscovered that the people who make Duncan Hines cake mix were puttinga lot of ethylene dibromide (EDB) into the cake mix to suppress weevils.This is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenic.The guy who represented the company in the press conference defendedhimself by saying that the risk from eating Duncan Hines products every dayfor a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoal-broiled steaks.  What a great analogy!  When I first heard that, myimmediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit!  One charcoalbroiled steak would be equivalent to 0.5 Duncans!

Surprise, surprise!This is true, but it's not quite the whole story.  There were actually some people who were more careful in their methodologywho also replicated the 'phantom leaf effect.'    One of the most influential critics of Kirlian Electrophotography    is a Theosophist (and threfore presumably willing to entertain the    hypothesis of scientific evidence for a human aura, electromagnetic    or otherwise), professor of electrical engineering at London's    City University, and a past president of the Society for Psychic Research     named A. J. Ellison.    After years of studying the method and the claims, Ellison    came to the conclusion that the photographic images are what we    calls 'Lichtenberg Figures,' an effect of intermittent ionization of    the air around the object.  It's a bit more complicated than    'not wiping off the plates,' but it comes down to the same thing    in the end, Kirlian electrophotography has much more limited    value (if any) than was previously widely thought.  Electrical and    magnetic fields generated by the body are much too small to be    of much use diagnostically without very elaborate equipment and    usually also tracer chemicals.kind regards,todd+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+| Todd I.

Yet again, the use of thisnewsgroup is hampered by people not restricting their posts to mattersthey have substantial knowledge of.For cites on MSG, look up almost anything by John W. Olney, atoxicologist who has studied the effects of MSG on the brain and ondevelopment.  It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is anexcitotoxic food additive, and that its major constituent, glutamateis essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain(humans included).  Too much in the diet, and the system gets thrownoff.  Glutamate and aspartate, also an excitotoxin are necessary insmall amounts, and are freely available in many foods, but the amountsadded by industry are far above the amounts that would normally beencountered in a ny single food.  By eating lots of junk food,packaged soups, and diet soft drinks, it is possible to jack yourblood levels so high, that anyone with a sensitivity to thesecompounds will suffer numerous *real* physi9logical effects. Read Olney's review paper in Prog. Brain Res, 1988, and check *his*sources. They are impecable. There is no dispute.                    --Dianne Murray    wcsbeau@ccs.carleton.ca

Chiropractic: all illnessstems from compressions of nerves by misaligned vertebrae.  Suchsystems are so patently absurd, that any good they do is accidentaland not related to the theory.  The only exception is probably herbalism,because scientists recognize the potent drugs that derive from plantsand are always interested in seeing if they can find new plantsthat have active and useful substances.  But that isn't what is meant by alternative medicine, usually.  If you get into the Qi,accupuntunce charts, etc, you are now back to silly theories thatprobably have nothing to do with why accupuncture works in some cases.Perhaps another reason they are reluctant is the Rhine experience.Rhine was a scientist who wanted to investigate the paranormaland his lab was filled with so much chacanery and fakery that people don't want to be associated with that sort of thing.  -- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, andgeb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon." ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mostof that is done in the hospital where migraines rarely are seen.Where are they supposed to learn?  Those who are diligent andread do learn, but most don't, unfortunately.>Sometimes I wonder what tension-type headaches have to do with>neurology anyway.We are the only ones, sometimes, who have enough interest in headachesto spend the time to get enough history to diagnose them.  Too often,the primary care physician hears "headache" and loses interest inanything but giving the patient analgesics and getting them out ofthe office so they can get on to something more interesting.>(I am excepting migraine, which is arguably neurologic).

The second question is something that's beenknown for some time.  It appears that within about 15 years of quittingsmoking a person's risk for developing lung cancer drops to that of theperson who never smoked (assuming you do not get lung cancer in theinterim!).  The risk to someone who smoked the equivalent of a pack perday for 40 years is around 20 times as high as a non-smoker.  Stillrather low overall, but significant.  Personally, I'd be more concernedabout heart disease secondary to smoking -- it's much more common, andeven a small increase in risk is significant there.-- =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==  Kenneth Gilbert              __|__        University of Pittsburgh   ==  General Internal Medicine      |      "...dammit, not a programmer!  ==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Med. on the topic of Colonic Flushing.  I'm in a profession that uses manipulation(a very refined form of massage) to treat various human diseases.  Proving that manipulation works has been extremely difficult(as the MD's delight in pointing out).  The Osteopathic Profession seems to be making better progress than the chiropractors in proving(scientifically) that their techingues work.  The JAOA recently had a study on the use of manipulation to relieve mensrual cramps in women with results that were as good or better than drug treatment(using physiological measurements, and not just the woman's preception of improvement).  This study was hailed by the JAOA editors as the turning point in the profession's long struggle to prove itself to the medical community.I'm currently trying to get the AOA(American Osteopathic Association) which has supported most of the Osteopathic research in the U.S. to also support nutrition education and research.  I've pointed out, in a grant proposal, that the founder of Osteopathic Medicine(A.T. Still) embraced both diet and manipulation to set himself apart from the MD's of his time who were pushing only drugs(Still was himself an MD who got real dissillusioned with drugs during his service in the Civil War).  He decided that there had to be a better way to treat human disease since he saw the cure(drugs) as being worse than the disease.  Through his many years of study of the human body, he developed his manipulation techniques that he then taught to his students in the U.S's first Osteopathic Medical school.  We now have 17.Still used manipulation to treat(and also diagnose) human disease but he used diet to prevent human disease.  I'm trying to get the Osteopathic Profession to return to it's roots and beat the MD's to the punch(so to speak).  Both DO's and MD's in current medical practice have very little understanding of how diet affects human health.  This has to change.Martin Banschbach, Ph.D.Professor of Biochemistry and ChairmanDepartment of Biochemistry and MicrobiologyOSU COllege of Osteopathic Medicine"You are what you eat."

I've been seeing her every 4 weeks for the past few months (I'm at week 28) and during the last 2 visits I've gained 9 to 9 1/2 pounds every 4 weeks.  She said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period. As it stands I've thus far gained 26 pounds.  Also she says that though I'm at 28 weeks the baby's size is 27 weeks, I think she mentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus.  When I was 13 weeks the baby's size was 14 weeks.  I must also add, that I had an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and I've had no problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain in my pelvic region during the pregnancy, and I have a very difficult time moving, and the doc has recommended I not walk or move unless I have to. (I have a little handicapped sticker for when I do need to go out.) Anyway that's 1/2 of the situation the other is that almost from the beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick (throwing up) about 2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated.  (I told her about this).  I know this because I wasn't eating very much due to the nausea and could see the 'results'.  Well now I only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks, and it is still bile related.  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my upper right abdomen, just below the right breast, usually when I was lying on my right side.  It began to get worse though because it started to hurt when I lay on my right side, and then it hurt  no matter what position I was in.  Next, I noticed that when I ate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had turned to stone, and the pain in the area got worse.  However if I ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it wasn't as much of a problem.So the doctor says I have cholistatis, and that I should avoid fatty foods.  This makes sense, and because I was already aware of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have been avoiding these foods on my own.  But I'm still able to eat foods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods.  But doc wants me to be on a non-fat diet.  This means no meat except fish and chicken w/o skin (I do this anyway).  No nuts, fried food, cheese etc.  I am allowed skim milk.  She said I should avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas).  Also I must only have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day ( potatoes, pasta, rice)!  She said I can't even cook vegetables in a little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or steamed.  I'm concerned because I understand you need to have some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process.  And if I'm not taking in fat, is she expecting the baby will take it from my stores?  And why this restriction on carbohydrates if she's concerned about fat?  I'm not clear how much of her recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on cholistatis, which I can't seem to find any information on.  She originally said that I should only gain 20 pounds during the entire pregnancy since I was about 20 lbs overweight when I started.  But my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and she's taken it all off and hasn't had any problems.  She also asked if any members of my family were obese, which none of them are.  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain, and feel like I'm being 'punished' by a severe diet.  She did want to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be temporary for that one week. What I want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet?  I would understand if she had said low-fat diet, since I'm trying that anyway, even if she said really low-fat diet.  I think she assumes I must be eating a high-fat diet, but really it is that because of the endometriosis and the operation I'm not able to use the energy from the food I do eat. Any opinions, info and experiences will be appreciated.  I'm truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few minutes and I'll end up having to eat constantly.  Thus far I don't find any foods satisfying.Thanks G

My doctor - who claims to have introduced Dr. Crook to thepossibility of candida overbloom causing diffuse symptoms way back in1961 (I have no reason to doubt him on this) - does not like the bookbecause 1) it makes too many unfounded claims, and 2) is horribly writtenfrom a scientific viewpoint.  On the other hand, my doctor has always keptan open mind on the subject and does believe in aspects of the "yeastconnection".But, I believe there is some truth to the book.  Hopefully the rightclinical studies can be done to separate the fact from the fiction.  Inthe meantime, I'd still encourage people who have "incurable" chronic sinusproblems (especially if they overused antibiotics), to find a doctor toadminister a systemic-type anti-fungal such as itraconazole (along withliver panels before, during and after treatment just to play it safe).  Itis an empirical approach for sure, but when all else fails, and your ENTsays "sorry, you'll just have to live with it", it is time to step out andtry an empirical approach backed up with significant anecdotal evidence(Dr. Ivker), supported by plausible theories (outlined by Marty).  Atthis stage you have little to lose, particularly if you use itraconazole andhave the proper monitoring - the health risk has been shown through extensiveclinical studies both in Europe and the U.S. to be very minimal withrelatively healthy (i.e., non-AIDS) patients.  I'm glad I did this, since Isaw remarkable results after only one week on Sporanox (itraconazole).  Ofcourse, your mileage may vary a lot - everyone is different so it may notwork for you.

Acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the frequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the candida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and L. acidophilus should be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the intestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to oxygen(just like it does in the vagina).  As much stuff as there is in the lay press about L. acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections, I'm really amazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out.The calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all conventional wisdom out the window.  Where would medicine be if conventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard medical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials?The clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene(and a very important one).  The lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria after antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason to dismiss it out-of-hand, especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply and safely(like it is in animal husbandry).Marty B.

If this is correct, I do not find it unreasonableto assume that high doses of MSG can cause other mouth tissues to swell.Also, as the many of the occurances (including two of the above)involved beef, and as beef is frequently tenderized with MSG, this iswhat I suspect as being the cause.I wouldn't be at all surprised if toxicity studies of MSG in animalsshowed it as being harmless, as it would be very startling to hear a labrat or rhesus monkey complain about their throats feeling funny.Anyone who wishes to explain how the majority of food additives aretotally harmless is welcome to e-mail me with the results of any studiedthey know of.

They are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS).Oops, that is not a recognized "illness" in the psychological community,better not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)Actually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicianswill type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system,just e-mail me and I'll send a summary file to you).  In the generalpopulation, NT's comprise only about 12% of the population, but amongphysicians it is much much higher (I don't know the exact percentage -any help here a.p.p.er's?)One driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obviouscholeric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need tocontrol, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they arealso extroverted, they are best described as "Field Marshalls".  This traitis very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want tolead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge,to raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science andtechnology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically-minded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other typesand temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However,when the NT person has self-image challenges, the "dark-side" of thispersonality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.A physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper theirtemperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling),and is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patientmust be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I'veknown many M.D.'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don't oblige themwith a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and theyusually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is anextreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).Maybe we need more NF doctor's.  :^)Enough on this subject - let's move on to candida bloom.>Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have >no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that >balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics...

Of course, I believe that I havebeen misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis', but beingthe phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few peoplemyself in past posts.  Let's all try to raise the level of this discussionabove the level of anal effluent.>...Humans have all >kinds of different organisms living in the GI system (mouth, stomach, small >and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.

Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuseswere a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged.I also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeksof Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterialinfection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won't get into thedetails), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT's made thisdiagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of thedifficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showeda bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help youunderstand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungaltherapy below).The first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poormucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without beingconsidered 'systemic' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetweeninfection.>Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals >and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what >vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling >Elaine's doctor a quack.I was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, aftermy blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, thendropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also receivedzinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairlycomplex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomolecularspecialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal,he then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin)supplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene.Call me carrot face.  :^)Hopefully, Elaine's doctor will take a similar, careful approach and toall supplements.  I'm even reevaluating some supplements I'm taking, forexample, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer hadgood information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-orderimprovement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably isnot worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.>survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides >the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In Though I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, thatI definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in mysinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies thatdemonstrate candida "blooms" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation(sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after oneweek of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during thistime - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting onSporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considerednormal).BTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can'tremember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950'swhich stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious)aspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinusinflammation symptoms.  I'll have to dig out that reference again since itis relevant to this discussion.>some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus >membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to >the candida or not isn't certain.My doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergicresponse to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive.Another question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this testis essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can growpart-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a threshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy toCandida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membraneirritation due to the body's allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post,one does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a Ph.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.BTW, and I'll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, "Sinus Survival",has routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemicanti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronicsinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times inthe last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but itdoesn't cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infectionis not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He's also found thatnystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.This implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom isaggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partwayinto the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than bydirect contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit,lots of 'ifs', and 'implies', which doesn't please the hard-core NT whohas to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue, but one has to startwith some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.>If it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty >nondescript.  This brings up an interesting observation used by those who will denyand reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until theappropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can't observe or culturethe yeast "bloom" in the gut or sinus, then there's no way to diagnose oreven recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtuallyimpossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannotbe easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.It's a real Catch-22.Another Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say thatno studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it's notup to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study whichshould not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies shouldbe done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order toconvince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets,you literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence tocompete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact studyneeded funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even getfunding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I'm very aware of this for thesmaller funded projects).  I'm afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 otherdoctors got together, pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotesinto a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would getnowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.It is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have*decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading tonoticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenablehypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidenceto the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they wouldalso oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue - excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, willnot, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who holdsuch a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...>Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in >the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the >vaginal tract which compete with it for food.

You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, butyou can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemicanti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones suchas Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as hasbeen pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I've been ine-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long-term treatment of GI tract "candidiasis".  It's like trying to weed a gardenby cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to comeout again once you walk away.The $60000 question is whether a contained candida "bloom" can partiallygrow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptomsin susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming "systemic" in theclassical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessivebloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection thatis potentially lethal.>In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good >reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very >favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and >humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.

Also, if one is an 'anal retentive', like I've been diagnosed in a priorpost, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)>If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even >blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.

After three months of aggressive andfairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring andequalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastlyimproved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated.Of course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would haveimproved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of theexperience of the three ENT's I saw who said that I'd just have to "live withit".  I'm confident I will reach what one could call a total "cure".  Theanti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that directionbecause of my overuse of ab's for the last four years.  (Note:  for thosehaving sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above.Be sure to get the revised edition.)>...I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic >GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his >patients is a non-existent syndrome.Dr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and hisvisits to several ENT's totally floored him when they said "you'll just haveto live with it".  He spent several years trying everything - standard andnon-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He nowshares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the roadto recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take asystemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history ofanti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his ownpractice.  I'm sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti-"yeast hypothesis" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as,"it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases", to put it mildly.I also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violatingtheir moral obligations to help the patient.Maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and areconfronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the "hypotheticalyeast overgrowth" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast peoplehave identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenueshave been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things -you cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor doessomething non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over athousand of his patients, shouldn't you at least sit up and take notice?Maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it worksinstead of why it shouldn't work.  I'm afraid a lot of doctors have becomeso enamored with "scientific correctness" that they are ignoring the patientsthey have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, whichwe don't see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point whenyou just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach(such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after havingexhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditionalmedical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  Iwent to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishment,and as a result I have found significant relief.Would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set upsome kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or havinghis license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt)therapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all theaccepted therapies are ineffective?  I'd like to hear a doctor tell me:"well, I've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in thiscountry, and since they clearly don't work for you, I now have the authorityto use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  Ican't promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to signsomething saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature ofthese unproven therapies, and I'll have to register your case at the StateBoard."  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would've jumped on thispronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruisticreasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with muchrisk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to thepatient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine,and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also wouldbe morally and ethically better than the current system by showing thecompassion of the medical community to the patient - that it's doing everythingit can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanismthat is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some ofwhich seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all(true quackery).I better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size.>If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.

I know it has to have been tough.There are many things that can cause long term confusion in elderlyadults.  The change in environment can cause problems.  Anesthetic agentscan cause confusion because the body cannot clear the medicines out ofthe body as easily.  In addition, medications and interactions betweenmedications can cause confusion.As far as whether or not haldol can have long lasting effects even afterthe drug has been discontinued, I do not know.  I have not _seen_ anythingto that effect.  However, I also had not been looking for that information.I can see what I can find...I can tell you that haldol is an antipsychotic drug, and, according tothe Nursing93 Drug handbook, it is "Especially useful for agitationassociated with senile dementia"  (p. 400).  It also should not be discontinued abruptly.  It did not say anything about long lastingeffects.Because so many things can cause confusion, it is hard for me to knowwhat else was going on at the time; if I had more history, i might be ableto answer you better.  If you want to send me e-mail with more information,I would be happy to try to  help you piece together what might havehappened.Elisapicl25@fsphy1.physics.fsu.edu

It *does*>imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are>incapable of discovering *which* treatments are effective and>which are not.)To start with, no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible.  Sothere's a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in agiven context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completelyand makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sumsof money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the otherhand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results whicheventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studiescontradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  "You people callTHIS science?"   (My opinion, for what it's worth, is that one sees boththese phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)  Some subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigorappropriate for a particular investigation.  I don't believe it is ever possible to banish subjective judgement from science.  My second point, though, is that highly capable people can often makeextremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when usingmethodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think thisis true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approachtheir discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.Within mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially beforethe twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who isfamous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later mathematicians did prove them, of course.)  I think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often notso much a matter of determining what is true and what's not  as it is a matter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of incompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to objectively convince others of the validity of one's results is anessential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step of the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward that goal then one is not doing science.)When a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does andseems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are alsoworthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth furtherinvestigation.  In article <C53By5.HD@news.Hawaii.Edu> I wrote: > Namely, is there really justification for the belief that> science is a superior path to truth than non-scientific approaches?  Admittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerableamount of effort in a "serious scholarly investigation" such as Isuggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately specific question to try and answer.  The "science" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science currently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century.  I certainly wasn't thinking of some idealized science or the mere use of "reason and observation."One thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whetherin many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experiencedpractitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies.  Since Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am withthe study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there is any existing research related to this question.  --In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet

Be sure a dietician is up to date on Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis.  Previously, low residue diets were recommended, but this advice hasnow changed.  Also, there will be differences in advice in patients withand without obstructuon remaining, so input by the physician will be important.  I find the dietician very important in my practice, and I send most of my patients to a dietician in the course of seeingthem, since dieticians know so much better how to get diet historiesand evaluate the contents of a diet than I do.Steve Holland

PRK vaporizes (burns) away a thin layer from the front of thecornea making the optical axis of the eye shorter. The laser doesn'tcut in PRK, it vaporizes.

Many of the predecessorsof Kekule's structure resemble the modern model more.I don't think "extra-scientific" is a very useful phrase in a discussionof the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rationalis a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known casesof extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.For example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture ofenantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked afriend's crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, butPasteur's discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), lookingat the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because helacked Pasteur's motivation to find something that distinguished racemicacid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.Again, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but becausehe was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebookscontained fantasies of becoming the "Newton of mirror-image life," whichhe never admitted publically.Perhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Averystarted this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophileand Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths' discoveries in mice.Most of Griffiths' critics were French, which decided the issue for thestudent.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths' work in vitro, which thestudent eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started theresearch program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).-- Mark A.

Dept. - New Mexico TechLines: 46Nntp-Posting-Host: balticFor a very long time I've had a problem with feeling really awfulwhen I try to get up in the morning.  My sleep latency at night is alsopretty long,  ranging from 30 min to an hour.  I get about 7 hours ofbedtime (maybe 6 of actual sleep) a night and more on the weekends.  Iwill spend two or three hours laying in bed after this if I can,  becauseI feel so tired when I wake up,  even more tired than I was when Iwent to bed,  which is usually too tired to work.Anyway,  I recently had a really bad flu,  so I called a friend toget me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestant;but he got Vicks formula 44M which has everything but an expectorant.  SoI used that anyway,  and the three nights I used it,  I fell asleep rapidlyand felt that I got really good quality sleep -- that is,  I actuallyfelt refreshed the next morning.So,  I am now trying to look into,  both in the literature andexperimentally,  the use of antihistamines as sleep aids,  since I ampresuming that it was the antihistamine that caused the effect.  Theantihistamine in Vicks formula 44 is Chloriphenamine maleate,  so I boughtsome generic tablets of that,  and tried one last night and didn'tnotice any improvement.  I might try one with a little alcohol (about1 beer) to see if it is a synergism effect.  Also,  library researchseems to show that Benadryl is the antihistamine with the strongestsedative effect of what is availible OTC.  So I might also buy a genericform of that and try that;  the PDR seems to suggest that 50 mg is a gooddosage level to try.For other medical information,  I have allergies but rarely havean allergic reaction living in New Mexico.  I also have chronically dryeyes,  which get horrible if I try to use most underarm deoderants.  I didguess that my problem might be caused by hypoglycemia,  so I made somechanges in my diet consistent with that,  and it didn't help,  so Iwent back to a normal diet (Pretty diverse,  also taking vitamin supplements)Anyway,  I am looking for advice for the use ofantihistamines as sleep aids,  and if there are any dangers of such use(Seems safe to me since they are used chronically for allergies bymillions).  I don't want to try BZs,  because BZ addiction seems to bea serious threat,  and from what I hear,  BZ sleep quality is not good,whereas antihistamine sleep quality seems to be better for me.  I havetried some dietary tryptophan loading stuff,  and that also seems tolower sleep quality,  I seem to wake up around 4:00 or so and be in somekind of mental haze until 7:00 or 8:00.  Also,  I would be interested inany other advice for helping my problem.  (Although I've already triedmany of the non-pharmacological solutions)

However, every time I had kidney stones, I saw my doctor and theonly thing they did was to prescribe some pain killers and medication for aurinary tract infection.  The pain killers did nothing for me...kidney stonesare extremely painful.  My stones were judged passable, so we just waited itout.  However the last one took 10 days to pass...not fun.  Anyway, if sheabsolutely won't see a doctor, I suggest drinking lots of fluids and perhapsan over the counter sleeping pill.  But, I do highly suggest seeing a doctor.Kidney stones are not something to fool around with.  She should be x-rayed to make sure there is not a serious problem.Steve

But many viruses mutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response(new antibody production).

Health effects of this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the medical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects of chronic antibiotic use( a view that I do not support). > -- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than> normal, and what does one do about it?Chronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up( in my opinion).  But most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is normal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many infectious diseases.  I do not share this view and there are some physicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection frequency and severity.  Exposure to an infectious agent does not have to result in a severe infection.  A strong immune response can minimize the length of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms associated with the infection.> -- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance?There are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong immune response to infectious agents.  They are: protein, vitamin C, vitamin A, iron and zinc.  The American diet is not low in protein so this is rarely a problem.  But vitamin A, vitamin C, iron and zinc are often low and this lack of an adequate pool(nutrient reserve) can impair the immune response.  Iron is know to be low in most kids(as is vitamin A).  There are distinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of these nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe infection.  Serum ferritin for iron status, dark adaptation for vitamin A status, red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for vitamin C status.  I have attempted to work up posts on these five nutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the others that I participate in.  I can e-mail you what I've worked up so far.But my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the critical role that diet plays in the human immune response.  You may also be able to get help from a nutritionist.  Anyone can call themselves a nutritionist so you have to be very carefull.  You want to find someone(like myself) who has had some formal training and education in nutrition.Many Ph.D. programs in the U.S. now offer degrees in Nutrition and that's what you need to look for.  Some dieticians will also call themselves nutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training needed to run specialized nutritional assessment tests.

However the paragraphs above seem to repeatuncritically the standard Kuhn/Lakatos/Feyerabend view of "progress" and"rationality" in science.  Since I've addressed these issues in thisnewsgroup in the not too distant past, I won't go into them again now.What is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives theimpression (and you may not in fact hold this view) that the common (perhapseven the "correct") approach for a scientist to follow is to sit aroundhaving flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies andpetty hatreds.  It further at least implicitly advances the position thatsciences goes "forward" (and it is not clear what this means given thecontext in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rationaland even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are thenweeded out via the "critical function" of science.  (Though why this criticalfunction should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery.If experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction aresubject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally trueof the application of any "critical function" concerning replication.This is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an "anything goes" view.)True, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.  But typically it is*not*.  Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to haveresulted in some way from a dream or from one's political views simplydo not generalize well to the actual history of science.-- Gary H.

Hopefully theZoloft will work.  Maybe your friend should try this one next.My psychiatrist's strategy seems to be to first try one of the serotonindrugs, usually Prozac.  If that works, great.  If it works but has too manyside effects, try Zoloft or maybe Paxil.

But after treating 4,000 mangled victims of Bosnia's bloodywar, he considers himself a surgeon.    ``Now I'm a surgeon with great experience although I have nolicense to practice. But if I operate on a person and he livesnormally that's the greatest license a surgeon could have.''    Evacuated by the U.N. this week to his home town of Tuzla,the Muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment ofthe horrors of the year-long Serb siege of Srebrenica and thesuffering of the thousands trapped there.    ``I lived through hell together with the people ofSrebrenica. All those who lived through this are the greatestheroes that humanity can produce,'' he told reporters.    Mujanovic, 31, had practiced for two months as an assistantat a local hospital in Tuzla, but before going to Srebrenica hehad never performed a surgical operation on his own. Now he sayshe has performed major surgery 1,396 times, relying on books forguidance, amputating arms and legs 150 times, usually withoutanesthetic, delivering 350 babies and performing four cesareansections.    He worked 18-to-19-hour days, slept in the hospital for thefirst 10 weeks after his arrival last Aug. 5 and treated  4,000patients.    He arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot fromTuzla, 60 miles northwest of Srebrenica. About 50 other peoplecarried in supplies and 350 soldiers guided and protected himthrough guerrilla terrain, he said.    His worst memory was of 10 days ago when seven Serb shellslanded within one minute in an area half the size of a footballfield, killing 36 people immediately and wounding 102. Half ofthe dead were women and children.    The people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and thechildren were playing soccer. ``There was no warning ... theblood flowed like a river in the street,'' he said.    ``There were pieces of women all around and you could notpiece them together. One woman holding her two children in herhands was lying with them on the ground dead. They had noheads.''    Before Mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions weredeplorable, he said. Many deaths could have been prevented hadthe hospital had surgical tools, facilities and medicine.    The six general practitioners who had been operating beforehe arrived had even less surgical experience than he did. ``Theydidn't know the basic principles for amputating limbs.''    Once he arrived the situation improved, he said, but bymid-September he had run out of supplies.    ``Bandages were washed and boiled five times ... sometimesthey were falling apart in my hands,'' he said. Doctors had noanesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the painbecause it increased bleeding.    ``People were completely conscious during amputations andstomach operations,'' he said. Blood transfusions wereimpossible because they had no facilities to test blood types.    ``I felt destroyed psychologically,'' Mujanovic said.    The situation improved after Dec. 4, when a convoy arrivedfrom the Belgian medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres.    But Mujanovic said the military predicament worsened inmid-December after Bosnian Serbs began a major offensive in theregion. ``Every day we had air strikes and shellings.''    Then the hunger set in.    Between mid-December and mid-March, when U.S. planes beganair dropping food, between 20 and 30 people were dying every dayfrom complications associated with malnutrition, he said.    ``I know for sure that the air drop operation saved thepeople from massive death by hunger and starvation,'' he said.    According to Mujanovic, around 5,000 people died inSrebrenica, 1,000 of them children, during a year of siege.    Mujanovic plans to return to Srebrenica in three weeks aftervisiting his wife, who is ill in Tuzla.    ``They say I'm a hero,'' he said. ``There were thousands ofpeople standing at the sides of the road, crying and waving whenI left. And I cried too.''-- Sharon Machlis GartenbergFramingham, MA  USAe-mail: sharon@world.std.com

She'd go pale, and sweaty and then vomit copiously.  A couple of us ventured a connection with MSG, and her response was: "MSG?  What's that?".  It also happened when she pigged out on some brands of savoury crackers and chips... which I noticed (later) had MSG on the label.

Some experimental treatments may have helped some people a bit, butthere have be no reports--even anecdotal--of massive good results withany of these experimental drugs.5. Some people with chronic loud tinnitus use noise blocking to get to sleep.6. Sudden onset loud tinnitus can be caused by injuries and sometimesabates or goes away after a few months.7. Aspirin is well known to exacerbate tinnitus in some people.8. There is a national association of tinnitus sufferers in the US.9. One usually gets used to it.

Material covered will include structural and informational molecules, the basic organization of the cell and of genetic material, the "central dogma" of gene expression, and selected other topics in the area of structure, function, and regulation as relates to current computational approaches.  Dr. Noordewier has appointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition to his current work in computational biology.12:00-2:45pm "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for  Biologists"  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)An overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be presented, as it relates to actual and potential biological applications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming languages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as selected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge representation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended audience includes biologists with some computational background, but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr. Lathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to biological problems in both academia and industry.3:00-5:45pm "Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory  in Biological Sequence Analysis" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos  National Laboratory) This tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of intelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine learning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general characteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such approaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic views of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such techniques in this domain.3:00-5:45pm "Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming"  Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)The genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly non-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally inspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both the biological motivations, and the actual implementation and characteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an extension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will also be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to biological applications, and to identifying resources and software that will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza, a Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught this subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in the field.3:00-5:45pm "Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis"  Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania)  & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)Approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies are increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation of tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic pattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes in sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and functional relatedness.  Dr. Searls, who holds research faculty appointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn, represents the branch of this field that considers higher-order syntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovski has studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the area of word-based analyses.

Stay tuned.I do not have enough medical expertise to have much of an opinionone way or another on hidden candida infections.  I canunderstand the skepticism of those who see this associated withvarious general kinds of symptoms, while there is a lack of soliddemonstration that this happens and causes such general symptoms.(To understand this skepticism, one only needs to know of pastfailures that shared these characteristics with the notion ofhidden candida infection.  There have been quite a few, and theproponents of all thought that the skeptics were overly skeptical.)On the other hand, I am happy to read that some people aresufficiently interested in this possibility, spurred bysuggestive clinical experience, to research it further.  Thedoubters may be surprised.  (It has happened before.)I realize that admitting ignorance in the face of ignorance maynot endear me to those who are so sure they know one way oranother.  (And, indeed, perhaps some of them do know -- I am theone who is currently ignorant.)  But I find this the most honestroute, and so I am happy with it.Russell

Some said that their heart beat speeded up with flush face. Some>claim their heart "skipped" beats once in a while.Both of these symptoms are related - tachycardia. Getting a flushedface is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regularpulse.  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels inthe blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both aresodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium, but like everything else,one can get too much of a good thing.>Some reacted with headache, Again, this could be related to increased blood flow from increasedheart rate, from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteries,essentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepencyher, necessarily.>some stomach ache.Well stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again, notnecessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomitingoccurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism haseaten. If a person can't digest the stuff (entirely possible - thelist of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks anenzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or bellyache) would be expected.> Some had watery eyes or running nose,These are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similarto vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxiouscompounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possiblesome other food or environmental compound could be responsible for thesymptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effetscan be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would benecessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the personwas exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopirationand heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far fromsimple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body. > some>had itchy skin or rashes. People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It dependsupon what it is about the compound that "pisses off" their body.Pollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in manypeople, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and anhistamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard,causing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with anallergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas thatcontain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance canperturb that person's system as much as inhaling it. >More serious accusations include respiration >difficulty See above. And don't think that heart rate changes, and circulatoryproblems are not serious. They can be deadly.and brain damage. The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine systemcontrolling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controllingthe cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin,and other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.>Now here is a new one: vomiting. My guess is that MSG becomes the number one>suspect of any problem. In this case. it might be just foodpoisoning. Absolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating ,say, undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic), plustoo much alcohol, and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home,plus, let's say, having contracted flu from one's sig. other 3 daysbefore from drinking out of the same glass. Could be all sorts ofthings.But it might be the MSG. >if you heard things about MSG, you may think it must be it.If noone else got sick, its likely not food poisoning. Probablystomach flu or an undetected thing the guy's allergic to.Anyway, the human body's not a machine; people vary widely in theirresponses, and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things.

However, in some parts of thecountry, you don't need to be known as an LD "specialist" to see a largenumber of LD patients walk through your office.  Given the huge problem ofunderdiagnosis, orthopedists encounter late manifestations of the disease justabout every day in their regular practices.  Dr. N. told me that last year,he sent between 2 and 5 patients a week to the LD specialists... and he is notthe only orthopedists in the town.Let's say that only 2 people per week actually have LD.  That means at the*very minimum* 104 people in our town (and immediate area) develop late stagemanifestations of LD *every year*.  Add in the folks who were diagnosed byneurologists, rheumatologists, GPs, etc, and you can see what kind of problemwe have.  No wonder just about everybody in town personally knows an LDpatient.He refers most patients to LD specialists, but in extreme cases he puts thepatient on medication immediately to minimize the damage (in most cases, tothe knees).Gordon is correct when he states that most LD specialists are GPs.-Marc.-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------              Marc C.

A press conference will be held at 12:30 p.m.   GUSTO evaluates the most aggressive emergency-room treatmentstrategies available to clear blocked heart arteries and restoreblood flow to the heart, a process called thrombolysis.  Thethrombolytic strategies compared in GUSTO use powerful drugs to breakup blood clots in heart vessels quickly and prevent clots fromrecurring.  These strategies have never been compared directly in alarge-scale clinical trial until GUSTO.  The results are expected tohave an important impact on heart attack treatment worldwide.   The press conference will be held at two locations: live at theNational Press Club, Main Lounge, 13th Floor, 529 14th St., N.W.,Washington D.C., and via satellite at The Hotel Macklowe, 145 W. 44thStreet, 4th Floor, New York City, between Broadway and 6th Avenue.

Set the follow-up(line in the header, depending on what kind of advice you give, or(e-mail directly to me: ceci@lysator.liu.se.)I have a problem with wasps -- they seem to love me. Last summer Icouldn't spend more than ten to fifteen minutes at a time in my gardenbefore one or several wasps would come for me. I am asking for adviceon how to repel wasps.   This year the wasps have built their nest under a stone next to oneof my tiny ponds. The caretaker (poor fellow!) will have to take careof them, and that will give me a head start on them. Last year wecouldn't find any nest. Even after the caretaker has gassed the nestin my tiny garden of 30 square meter, other wasps will most likely viefor the territory. Is there anything I can grow, rub on my skin orspread on the soil that will repel the black and yellow bastards?Never mind if it turns my skin purple or kills off all my belovedplants, I want to be able to spend time in my garden like everyoneelse.   Would it help to remove the ponds and the bird bath? The wasps seemto come to drink at them, and I suppose that their prey will breed inthem. The black tits seem to be afraid of the wasps, because as soonas the wasp season starts, they stop coming to have their bath.Even when I am not trying to win back my patio from 15-20 wasps, theyseem to love me. The advice I usually get when I ask what to do aboutwasps, is to stand still and not wave my arms. I've got some painfulstings when trying to follow that advice. I have also tried to usehygienic products without perfumes, to no avail. They still love me,and come for me, even when I'm in the middle of a crowd.

I was part of a study a few years ago at the University of Arizona tosee whether cross dominant individuals (those with a particular handednessbut who had dominance in the opposite eye) were better hitters thanthose with same side dominance of hand and eye.  I was picked frommy softball class because I was cross dominant (right hand, left eye)which put me in a small minority (and the grad student was trying to getan equal number of cross dominant and same side dominant people).  Tocontrol the study, she used a pitching machine - fast pitch.  SinceI was used to slow pitch, I didn't come close (actually I thinkI foul tipped a few) to hitting the ball.  If there were a lot of peoplelike me in her study (i.e., those who can't hit fast pitch, or arenot used to hitting off a machine),  I would seriously question theresults of that study!!  I think there have been some studies of majorleague players (across a fairly large cross section of players) to testwhether eye dominance being the same or opposite side was "better" -but I don't know the results.  (The woman who ran the study I was insaid that there was a higher incidence of crossdominance in majorleaguers than across the general population - but I'm not surewhether I'd believe her.)Janice Rathmann

What does this have to do with how well> nutrition is taught, anyway?Elisabeth, let's set the record straight for the nth time, I have not read "The Yeast Connection".  So anything that I say is not due to brainwashing by this "hated" book.  It's okay I guess to hate the book, by why hate me?Elisabeth, I'm going to quote from Zinsser's Microbiology, 20th Edition.A book that you should be familiar with and not "hate". "Candida species colonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortly thereafter.  The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present.  Indeed, candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic mycosis."  Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic infection(candidiasis) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or "sick" neutrophils to see a systemic infection.  Poor diet and persistent parasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis.Your assessment of candidiasis in the U.S. is correct and I do not dispute it.What I posted was a discussion of candida blooms, without systemic infection.  These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation(GI tract, mouth, vagina and sinus cavity).  Knocking down the bacterial competition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida blooms.  Let me quote from Zinsser's again: "However, some factors, such as the use of a broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic, may predispose to both mucosal and systemic infections".  I was addressing mucosal infections(I like the term blooms better).  The nutrition course that I teach covers this effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the "cure".  I guess that your nutrition course does not, too bad.  >>Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly >>called, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible>>for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a >>yeast-like fungus.  > > Well, maybe I'm getting picky, but I always thought that a yeast> was one form that a fungus could exist in, the other being the> mold form.

(shudder)> Or maybe you did know, and were oversimplifying?My, my Elisabeth, do I detect a little of Steve Dyer in you?  If you noticed my faculty rank, I'm a biochemist, not a microbiologist.Candida is classifed as a fungus(according to Zinsser's).  But, as you point out, it displays dimorphism.  It is capable of producing yeast cells, pseudohyphae and true hyphae.  Elisabeth, you are probably a microbiologist and that makes a lot of sense to you.  To a biochemist, it's a lot of Greek.  So I called it a yeast-like fungus, go ahead and crucify me.You know Elisabeth, I still haven't been able to figure out why such a small little organism like Candida can bring out so much hostility in people in Sci. Med.  And I must admitt that I got sucked into the mud slinging too.I keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about what I've said, that it will make sense.  I'm not asking anyone here to buy into "The Yeast Connection" book because I don't know what's in that book, plain and simple. And to be honest with you, I'm beginning to wish that it was never written.Marty B.

He was immediately transferred to a major hospital in Bostonand has since been undergoing extensive drug treatment for his condition.This has been a major learning experience for me and my wife not only inlearning the medical problems that faced our son but also in dealing withhospitals, procedures...etc.I don't want to go into a lot of detail, but his condition was termed quite severe at first then slowly he began to grow and put on weightas a normal baby would. He was put on the standard anti-convulsion drugsand that did not seem to help out. His MRI, EKG, cat-scans are all normal,but the EEG's show alot of seizure activity. After many metabolic tests,body structure tests, and infection/virus tests the doctors still do notknow quite what type of siezures he is having (although they do have alotof evidence that it is now pointing to infantile spasms ). This is wherewe stand right now....If anyone knows of any database or newsgroup or as I mentioned up above,any information relating to this disorder I would sure appreciate hearingfrom you. I am not trying to play doctor here, but only trying to gatherinformation about it. As I know now, these particular types of disordersare still not really well understood by the medical community, and so I'mgoing to see now....if somehow the internet can at least give me alittleinsight.

From THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY GUIDE TO TOTAL NUTRITION: Stanley Gershoff,    Ph.D., Dean of Tufts University School of Nutrition; HarperPerennial, 1991   (ISBN #0-06-272007-4):"The greatest hazard of barbecuing is that the cook will not use enough caution and get burned.  Some people suggest that the barbecuing itself is dangerous, because the smoke, which is  absorbed by the meat, contains benzopyrene, which, in its pure form, has been known to cause cancer in laboratory animals.  However, in order to experience the same results, people would have to consume unrealistically large quantities of barbecued meat at a time."-Rich Young (These are not Kodak's opinions.)

None of his A-1 through A-5antineoplastons have been shown to have antineoplastic effects againstexperimental cancer. The NCI conducted tests of A-2 and A-5 againstleukemia in mice, with the result that doses high enough to producetoxic effects in the mice were not effective in inhibiting the growthof the tumor or killing it. (These were in 1983 and 1985)Burzynski claims that A-10 is the active factor common to all of A-1and A-5 (something which he has not shown, A-10 has only beenextracted from A-2. He also hasn't shown that A-1 through A-5 are actuallydistinct substances). The NCI conducted a series of tests using A-10against a standard panel of tumors that included different cell linesfrom tumors in the following classes: leukemia, non-small-cell andsmall-cell lung cancer, colon cancer, cancer of the central nervoussystem, melanoma, ovarian cancer and renal cancer. A-10 exhibitedneither growth inhibition nor cytotoxicity at the dose levels tested.It is necessary to process A-10 since it is not soluble (Burzynski'stheory requires soluble agents), but this basically hydrolizes it toPAG (which he calls AS 2.5). PAG is not an information carryingpeptide, something which Byrzynski claims is necessary forantineoplastic activity. AS 2.1 (also derived from A-10) is a 4:1mixture of PA and PAG. PA (also not a peptide) can be purchased at achemical supply houses for about $0.09 a gram. A-10 is chemicallyextremely similar to glutithamide and thalidomide, both of which arehabit forming and can cause peripheral neuropathy. The nasty effectsof thalidomide are widely known. In spite of this similarity, A-10does not appear to have been tested for it's potential to induceteratogenicity or peripheral neuropathy.Many of Burzynski's statements about the origin of his theory, earlyresearch, past and present support by others for his work have beenshown to be untrue.sdb---sdb@ssr.com

Their anticholinergic effects (drying of secretions,relaxing effects on smooth muscle) can be problematic in some people, such asthose with glaucoma or prostate enlargement.Antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or doxylamine (Unisom)are potent sedatives which are useful occasionally.  Chlorpheniramine(Chlor-Trimeton) is said to be less sedative, but 8mg seems to workwell in some people.  Both chlorpheniramine and doxylamine have longhalf-lives compared to diphenhydramine, and so may produce a residualhangover or "drugged" feeling the next morning.-- Steve Dyerdyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer

I am taking less pain medication than I was previously.     The folks at BACK TECHNOLOGIES are VERY reluctant to honor their return policy.  They extended my "warranty" period rather than allow me to return the machine when, after the first month or so, I was not thrilled with it. They encouraged me to continue to use it, abeit less vigourously.    Like I said, I can't say it is a cure-all, but it keeps me stretched outand I am in less pain.--***********************************************************************Dale M.

I still believethat doing your own research is very, very necessary.  I wouldnot have progressed as much as I have today, unless I had spentthe many hours in Stanford's Med Library as I have done.And 5 years ago, it was clear that there was no medicine that would help me.  So should I have stopped searching.  Thankgoodness I didn't.  Now I found that there is indeed medicinethat helps me.  I think that what you've said is kind of idealistic.  That youwould go to one doctor, get a diagnosis, maybe get a secondopinion, and then move on with your life.Just as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists in this field in the country, I have received 6 different diagnoses.These are the top names, the ones that people come to from all overthe country.  I have HAD to sort all of this out myself.  Goingto a support group (and in fact, HEADING that support group) was helpful for a while, but after a point, I found it veryunproductive.  It was much more productive to do library research,make phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself.A recent movie, Lorenzo's Oil, offers a perfect example of whatI'm talking about.  If you haven't seen it, you should.  It's nota put down of doctor's and neither is what I'm saying.  Doctors areonly human and can only do so much.  But there are those of usout here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missingpiece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.I guess I'm biased because dizziness is one of those weird thingsthat is still so unknown.  If I had a broken arm, or a weak heart,or failing kidneys, I might not have the same opinion.  That's because those things are much more tangible and have much more concise definitions and treatments.  With dizziness, you just have todecide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying tofind your way out of it.I have chosen the latter.Lindalindae@netcom.netcom.com>>-- >---------------------------------------------------------------------------->Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | "Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and>geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon." >----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have any ideas on criteria for greatness, I would bepleased to hear them. In any event, please nominate people even if you arenot sure they are great. I would like as big a list as possible. Please give me a name and email address, phone number or mail address, sothat I can contact the person. If you don't know any of the above, thengive me their last known whereabouts. Also please give your reason for whyyou think the person should be considered a great Canadian scientist. After I have the list, I will choose about six of the most interesting onesand do in-depth biographies of those individuals in the style of TracyKidder's "Soul of a New Machine" or some other dramatic technique.The rest of the great Canadian scientists will appear in an appedix with one paragraph biographies.

It's amazing to see just how much was discoveredby Canadians. Actually there are many more who were born in Canada, butbecame Americans after graduate school. Please note: a lot of people have nominated Alexander Graham Bell but Ifeel he was really a Scottish/American with a summer home in Canada. NowI know this is debatable, but please don't nominate him again. If anyone can fill in some of the question marks on the list, please dropme a line.================================================== That was two years ago. Since then, I have received a grant from ScienceCulture Canada, a division of Supply and Services Canada to research thebook. Since my old posting the book has evolved into an educational bookfor kids aged 9 - 14 (though this may change again) It will have about40 two-page spreads with a large graphic in the middle and text/graphicboxes all around on the following subjects: Vital statistics and photo ofthe scientist, Personal statement from the scientist, Narrative of a fewmoments in the life of the scientist, "What I was doing when I was 12",So you want to be a <insert kind of scientist>, Experiment you can do. There will be an appendix with 100 - 200 more scientists with one paragraphbiographies who didn't quite make it to the double spreads. The whole thingwill then be published on CD-ROM with video and sound clips for addedrichness. I am looking for a CD-ROM publisher as well. The text part mayalso be available on the CANARIE electronic highway being developed inCanada as well. I am still looking for a publisher though Penguin Canada came close to being it. Hope to find one soon.  I would like to again ask for more nominations, especially in thepure sciences of Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Also criticisms of the list are welcomed. Also women and French-Canadian scientists are needed. I hope this posting will get others to nominate more Great CanadianScientists, and to discuss what is "great" what is "Canadian" and what is"scientist".

The degree of:elevation (in the serum transaminases) can be trivial, or as much as ten times:normal. Other blood chemistries are usually normal. :As a rule, patients with CPH have no clinical signs of liver disease. :Chronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, at:least initially, and that's why it's important to tell them apart by means of:a biopsy. The patient with CPH only needs to be reassured. The patient with:CAH needs to be treated.I just went back to the chapter in Cecil on chronic hepatitis.  It seemsthat indeed most cases of CPH are persistant viral hepatitis, whereasthere are a multitude of potential and probable causes for CAH (viral,drugs, alcohol, autoimmune, etc.).  Physicians seem to have a variety of"thresholds" for electing to biopsy someone's liver.  Personally, I thinkthat if the patient is asymptomatic, with only slight transaminitis andnormal albumin and PT, one can simply follow them closely and not add thepotential risks of a biopsy.  Others may well biopsy such a patient, thusproviding these samples for study.  It would be interesting to see ifanyone's done any decision analysis on this.-- =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==  Kenneth Gilbert              __|__        University of Pittsburgh   ==  General Internal Medicine      |      "...dammit, not a programmer!" ==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

What is the mechanism and why would a physician>call for chest xrays to diagnose the cause of the clubbing?Purists often distinguish between "true" clubbing and "pseudo"clubbing, the difference being that with "true" clubbing theangle of the nail when viewed from the side is constantlynegative when proceeding distally (towards the fingertip).With "pseudo" clubbing, the angle is initially positive, thennegative, which is the normal situation. "Real" internistscan talk for hours about clubbing. I'm limited to a coupleof minutes.Whether this distinction has anything to do with reality isentirely unclear, but it is one of those things that internistslove to paw over during rounds. Supposedly, only "true" clubbingis associated with disease. The problem is that the list ofdiseases associated with clubbing is quite long, and includesboth congenital conditions and acquired disease. Since many ofthese diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problemsleading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia, it isvery reasonable to get a chest xray. However, many of the congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiaccatheterization. The cause of clubbing is unclear, but presumably relates tosome factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip todilate abnormally. Clubbing is one of those things from an examination which isa tipoff to do more extensive examination. Often, however,the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent.-km

It is what you feel if you are overwhelmed by a feelingof comfort, such as seeing or thinking about something beautiful.     Another thing.  When you sleep, you lie down facing up, with yourpalms aside of you and facing down on the surface of the bed.  Then yourelax, and there start involuntary nerve firings inside your flesh.  So,you feel a "shiver" below the surface of the skin (not heart-beat).Then this shiver increases, and comes up to your head, and the roam youhear loudens.  (Note that you always hear a high-pitch when you lie downin bed; this is just the noise of your blood running in your ear.)  Thisroam is different from the high pitch, but follows the shiver of yourbody.     "Shiver" is not the word.  It may be called a mild vibration or quake.What is this shiver and roam?  Can I use this to induce out-of-bodyexperience?Daniel Chung (Mr.), U.S.A.

Does anone have any informationI'm not sure that this condition is "recognised" anywhere (in thesense of a disease with diagnostic criteria, clear boundariesbetween it and other diseases, unique pathologic or physiologicfeatures, etc), but here goes with what many neurologists agree on.Post-polio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron diseaseby clinical examination, EMG, and muscle biopsy.  The abnormalitiesare mostly chronic (due to old polio) but there is evidence ofongoing deterioration.  Clinically, the patients complain ofdeclining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasks.Musculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtlesscontributes to the impaired performance.  The examination showsmuscle weakness and atrophy.  The EMG shows evidence of olddenervation with reinnervation (giant and long-duration motor unitaction potentials) *and* evidence of active denervation(fibrillation potentials).  The biopsy also shows old denervationwith reinnervation (fiber-type grouping) *and* evidence of activedenervation (small, angulated fibers with dense oxidative enzymestaining) - but curiously, little or no group atrophy.Post-polio patients do not have ALS.  In ALS, there is clinicallyevident deterioration from one month to the next.  In post-polio,the patients are remarkably stable in objective findings from oneyear to the next.  Of course, there are patients who had poliobefore who develop genuine ALS, but ALS is no more common amongpolio survivors than among people who never had polio.The cause of post-polio syndrome is unknown.  There is littleevidence that post-polio patients have active polio virus ordestructive immunologic response to virus antigen.There is no solid evidence that patients with post-polio haveanything different happening to the motor unit (anterior horn cells,motor axons, neuromuscular junctions, and muscle fibers) thanpatients with old polio who are not complaining of deterioration.Both groups can have the same EMG and biopsy findings.  The reasonfor these "acute" changes in a "chronic" disease (old polio) isunknown.  Possibly spinal motor neurons (that have reinnervated hugenumbers of muscle fibers) start shedding the load after severalyears.There are a couple of clinical features that distinguish post-poliosyndrome patients from patients with old polio who denydeterioration.  The PPS patients are more likely to have had severepolio.  The PPS patients are *much* more likely to complain of pain.They also tend to score higher on depression scales ofneuropsychologic tests.My take on this (I'm sure some will disagree):  after recovery fromsevere polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles, tendons,ligaments, bones, and joints, that leads to inflammatory and/ordegenerative conditions affecting these structures.  The increasingpain, superimposed on the chronic (but unchanging) weakness, leadsto progressive impairment of motor performance and ADL.  I amperhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a PPSpatient who was not limited in some way by pain.  I do not believethat PPS patients have more rapid deterioration of motor units thannon-PPS patients (i.e., those with old polio of similar severity butwithout PPS complaints).--- . SLMR 2.1 .

As usual, you are missing the whole point, Russell, because you are notwilling to even consider questionning your basic article of faith, whichis that science is merely a matter of methodology and that the highestpurpose of science is to avoid making mistakes.  This is like saying that the most important aspect of business managementis accurate bookkeeping.  If science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes, itwould be a poor thing indeed.  What was the methodology of Darwin?  Whatwas the methodology of Einstein?  What was, for that matter, themethodology of Jenner and Pasteur?  In an earlier article, Russell Turpin writes:  >None of the foregoing should be read as meaning that we should>open the door to practitioners of quackery and psuedo-science.>Modern advocates of homeopathy, chiropracty, and traditional>Chinese medicine receive little respect because, for the most>part, they use methods and reasoning that the kind of research>Lee Lady recommends has shown to be terribly faulty.  (This does>*not* imply that all their treatments are ineffective.  It *does*>imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are>incapable of discovering *which* treatments are effective and>which are not.)First of all, I think you are arguing against a straw man, because Idon't think that anyone here is arguing that quackery, pseudo-science,homeopathy, chiropracty, and traditional Chinese medicine should beaccepted as science.  I, in particular, think the basic ideas ofhomeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky.  What some of us do believe, however, is that some of these things(including some of the flaky ideas) are deserving of serious scientificattention.  If in fact it were true, as you have stated above, that those who do notuse the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what iseffective and what is not, then science today would not exist.  For allof current science is based on the past work of scientists whosemethodology, by current standards, was seriously flawed.  It is certainly true that as methodology improves, we need to re-examinethose results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies.  It isalso true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on those early methodologies needs to be re-examined in a more rigorous fashion by those qualified to do so credibly.  But to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double-blind studies iscapable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that noideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possiblybe worthy of serious investigation ... this truly marks one's attitude asdoctrinaire, cultist.  This attitude is not compatible with a belief inreason.  --In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet

"Treating people with AZT alone doesn't  happen in the real world anymore," said Dr. Mark Jacobson of the  University of California--San Francisco.

The network is expected to cost between $75 million and $125 million but is  an essential part of the Clinton administration's health reform  plan, according to the CDC and outside experts.  The plan will  require the CDC to enhance surveillance of disease in the United  States and establish about 15 facilities across the world to  track disease.      =====================================================================                                  April 13, 1993      =====================================================================  "NIH Plans to Begin AIDS Drug Trials at Earlier Stage" Nature (04/01/93) Vol. 362, No. 6419, P. 382  (Macilwain, Colin) HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 42Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993     The National Institutes of Health has announced it will start  treating HIV-positive patients as soon as possible after  seroconversion, resulting from recent findings that show HIV is  active in the body in large numbers much earlier than was  previously believed.  Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S.  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  said, "We must address the question of how to treat people as  early as we possibly can with drugs that are safe enough to give  people for years and that will get around microbial resistance."  He said any delay would signify questions over safety and  resistance rather than a lack of funds.  Fauci, who co-authored  one of the two papers published last week in Nature, rejects the  argument by one of his co-authors, Cecil Fox, that the new  discovery indicates that "$1 billion spent on vaccine trials" has been "a waste of time and money" because the trials were started  too long after the patients were infected and were ended too  quickly.  John Tew of the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument for  early treatment of HIV-infected patients.  AIDS activists  welcomed the new information but said the scientific community  has been slow to understand the significance of infection of the  lymph tissue.  "We've known about this for five years, but we're  glad it is now in the public domain," said Jesse Dobson of the  California-based Project Inform.  But Peter Duesberg, who  believes that AIDS is independent of HIV and is a result of drug  abuse in the West, said, "We are several paradoxes away from an  explanation of AIDS--even if these papers are right."     ======================================================================                                   April 14, 1993     ======================================================================   "Risk of AIDS Virus From Doctors Found to Be Minimal" Washington Post (04/14/93), P. A9      The risk of HIV being transmitted from infected health-care  professionals to patients is minimal, according to new research  published in today's Journal of the American Medical Association  (JAMA).  This finding supports previous conclusions by health  experts that the chance of contracting HIV from a health care  worker is remote.  Three studies in the JAMA demonstrate that  thousands of patients were treated by two HIV-positive surgeons  and dentists without becoming infected with the virus.  The  studies were conducted by separate research teams in New  Hampshire, Maryland, and Florida.  Each study started with an  HIV-positive doctor or dentist and tested all patients willing to participate.  The New Hampshire study found that none of the  1,174 patients who had undergone invasive procedures by an  HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon contracted HIV.  In Maryland, 413 of 1,131 patients operated on by a breast surgery specialist at  Johns Hopkins Hospital were found to be HIV-negative.

The Florida researchers, led by Gordon  M. Dickinson of the University of Miami School of Medicine, said, "This study indicates that the risk for transmission of HIV from  a general dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting in  which universal precautions are strictly observed."

The OAM is a small division of the NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10 billion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available research grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be available this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for Natural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid to become involved in AIDS.  "They have to look successful and there is no easy answer in AIDS," she said.    There is also a common perception that the OAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening, such as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an advisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS community was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists' general lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic will be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, "The OAM advisory panel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It  will take them several years to accept the nature of research."   Nevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigator at the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, "Here is a wonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.  It's only fair to give the Office time to gel, but  it's up to the public to insist that it's much, much more [than  public relations]." ======================================================================   "Herpesvirus Decimates Immune-cell Soldiers" Science News (04/03/93) Vol. 143, No. 14, P. 215   (Fackelmann, Kathy A.)      Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus-6 can attack the human immune system's natural killer cells.  This attack causes the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component in the immune system's fight  against diseases.  Also, the herpesvirus-6 may be a factor in  immune diseases, such as AIDS.  In 1989, Paolo Lusso's research  found that herpesvirus-6 attacks another white cell, the CD4  T-lymphocyte, which is the primary target of HIV.  Lusso also  found that herpesvirus-6 can HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 44Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993kill natural killer cells.   Scientists previously knew that the natural killer cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso's  research represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural killer cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony L. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube findings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the body.  Lusso's  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor  molecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface receptor, making them vulnerable to HIV's attack.   Researchers concluded that herpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV.     ======================================================================                                   April 15, 1993      ====================================================================   "AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: To the Editor" Journal of the American Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Gellert, George and Nordenberg, Dale F.)      All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only ensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health problems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert and Dale F. Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency, Santa Ana, Calif., and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta, Ga.,  respectively.  Dr. Berkley's editorial on why American doctors  should care about the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for the concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should be noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it is not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many  respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.  Berkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have on many developing countries, and the increased need for international assistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political aggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach to international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS in particular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book "Earth in the Balance" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable international development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child survival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the developing  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically  change the future of worldwide health. ====================================================================   "AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply" Journal of the American HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth)      Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible before the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less attention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller Foundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and Nordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as malaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited  economic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention than they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is receiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most developing countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic diseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another year  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS and its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden but financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a rampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley says he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and  economic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he concludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the United States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries with high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic  has been the rule.HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 46Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::                               AIDS/HIV Articles::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::            First HIV Vaccine Trial Begins in HIV-Infected Children                                H H S   N E W S     ********************************************************************                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES                                March 29, 1993        First HIV Vaccine Therapy Trial Begins In HIV-Infected ChildrenThe National Institutes of Health has opened the first trial of experimental HIV vaccines in children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. The trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90 children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Volunteers must be HIV-infected but have no symptoms of HIV disease. HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as "a hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected children who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS." Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial "is the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay disease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick."  If these vaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their therapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in the United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World Health Organization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide. The study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  NIAID, which funds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network, anticipates conducting the trial at nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in the ACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows that certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses and HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993stimulate new ones.  It will be several years, however, before researchers know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease. The results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined closely for other reasons as well.  "This trial will provide the first insight into how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines," said Daniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID's division of AIDS.  "We need this information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent HIV infection in children." In the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city areas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic. Nearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during pregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection drug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding increase in the numbers of infected children. HIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.  The most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV develop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of childhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays. At least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older participants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no symptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen liver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune-regulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study. Study chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical School, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School of Medicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medical officer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID's division of AIDS. "We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children for any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or fevers, for example, than another," said Dr. McNamara.  "We'll also look at whether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other significant laboratory or clinical effects."   He emphasized that the small study size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 48Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993products. The trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from recombinant HIV proteins.  These so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically engineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved well-tolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults. One vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--a protein  that gives rise to HIV's surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant.  Adjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  Presently, alum is the only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug Administration. Both of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco and the other by Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, in Emeryville, Calif.--contain the major HIV surface protein, gp120, plus adjuvant.  The Genentech vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine vaccine contains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in other Phase I vaccine trials in adults. A low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15 children.  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the experimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone, considered the placebo.  Neither the health care workers nor the children will be told what they receive. If the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of the experimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will begin. Each child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for six months--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.

They report that HIV itself, not an opportunistic infection, caused scaling skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for HIV.  Although the HIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals' immunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV itself caused the skin disease. Our findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease without affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues described their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses. Developing animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most animals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this problem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for HIV as well as their own genetic material. NIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters contained both normal and transgenic animals. Institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV genetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon after birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an incomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer. Some of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their necks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin lesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No skin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates. Studies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can cause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the animals. Tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the presence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993Evidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were "turned on," or active, said Dr. Kopp. The scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the mice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common infections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals' immune systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the skin lesions, Dr. Kopp said. Further proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.  Papilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the genes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light. The transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter Dickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Collaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs. Nickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR; Dr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney, formerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 51Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993               Clinical Consultation Telephone Service for AIDS                                H H S   N E W S                 ********************************************                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES                                 March 4, 1993     HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala today announced the first nationwide clinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care professionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV infection or AIDS.      The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a physician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. It provides information on drugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service is funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of San Francisco General Hospital.      Secretary Shalala said, "One goal of this project is to share expertise so patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health care providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and community social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients with HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience."      Secretary Shalala said, "This clinical expertise should be especially helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in communities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available."      The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and it is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST) Monday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer questions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and health care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be answered as quickly as possible.      Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question related to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment information, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral, literature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health care professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate sources of information or materials.      When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken by either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse practitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and inpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant asks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current medications, sex, age and the patient's HIV history.      This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 52Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993responded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern California.  The initial project was funded by HRSA's Bureau of Health Professions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and by the American Academy of Family Physicians.      "When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of care they are able to provide to their patients," said HRSA Administrator Robert G. Harmon. M.D., M.P.H.  "This project will be a great resource for health care professionals and the HIV/AIDS patients they serve."      "This service has opened a new means of communication between health care professionals and experts on HIV care management," said HRSA's associate administrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health Resources Development, G.

As a rule, patients with CPH have no clinical signs of liver disease.

Yes, its great to be involved in a process were I can walk into thelab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of it(as long as my advisor doesn't catch me - which is easy enough to do), but stamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant review committees and the peer review process in general.  In today's world that's what determines what science is: what gets funded.  And a damn good thing to.Flights of fantasy just don't have much chance of producing anything, at least not in biomedical research.  The surest way for a graduate student toruin their life is to work in a lab where the boss is more concerned with fleshing out his/her fantasies than with having the student work on a projectthat actually has a good chance of producing some results.  MD's seem to be particularly prone to this aberrant behavior.  >(Simple example: Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA>electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments.

I've read alot of theAlu and middle repetitive sequence work and it's really very interesting, good work with implications for many fields in molecular genetics.  It's really an example of how a well reasoned project turned up interesting results that were unexpected.Mike

She'd been reluctant to have treatment for thehyperthyroidism for many years and apparently started to show exaustionfrom it. I understand that she may still be testing high in thyroid levelbut she's isn't being treated by an endocrinologist. Her previousendocrinologist bowed out when she entered the hospital. She entered thehospital because of the Sweet's syndrome symptoms (skin lesions).I've looked through the last two years of Medline and didn't find anabstract mentioning a correlation between thyroid and Sweets. . I checked a handbook which said that Sweet's was associated with leukemia.I'd like a reccomndation for experts who are in New York City or who travelto New York City. For the sweets and perhaps for the endocrinology.Any information that might help. Apparently there hasn't been muchimprovement in her condition over the past several months. -Jackie-

The psoriasis is undercontrol but the arthritis part of the illness is not.Ansaid (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) worked pretty well for three years butisn't helping much now.  My friend is now taking Meclomen (another NSAID) butthis isn't helping control the pain at all.  In the past two months my friendhas also started taking Azulfadine along with the NSAID medicines, but theeffects of the combined drugs aren't supposed to be realized for several months.As a result of the pain, my friend is having problems sleeping.  Staying inone position too long is an ordeal.  Another major contributor to pain is thattendonitis has now developed (left thumb and hand with numbness at the base ofthe palm; bottom of feet; shoulders and outer thighs).  The tendonitis isquite painful yet my friend's doctor has not recommended any form of treatmentto relieve it.The latest twist is that the doctor has dropped the anti-inflammatories and isnow recommending Prednisone.  The hope is that the Prednisone will relieve someof the pain from the tendonitis.My friend is a 41 year old male who feels like he's 80 (his words, not mine).If anyone is aware of any new treatments for Psoriatic Arthritis, alternativecourses of action, support groups or literature on it, I would be extremelygrateful if you could e-mail to me.

Ordinary massageis intended to make a person feel better, especially if they have muscularor joint problems.  But -- like chiropracty -- there are some practitionerswho take the technique to a far extreme, invoking what seems to me to bequack science to justify their technique.In the case of massage, there is a technique called "deep abdominal massage"in which the masseur is literally attempting to massage the intestines!The notion is that undigested food adheres to the inner surface of theintestines and putrifies, releasing poisons which cause various diseasesyndromes.  By this vigorous and painful procedure, it is alleged thatthese deposits can be loosened up and passed out.I just can't believe this idea has any truth behind it!  The human intestineis not a New York City sewer pipe!  And even if it were, you eat half ofa small box of Triscuits, and there ain't gonna be nothin' sticking to theinner surface of your intestine  :-)

We're talking prudent policy in>infant nutrition here, yet you're misrepresenting it as received wisdom.Who said anything about 'received wisdom'? There is no question thatorally administered doses of MSG are capable of destroying nearly allneurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the medianeminence. These areas are responsible for the production ofhormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normaldevelopment of the vertabrate organism. Humans are vertebrates. Nowwhat, pray tell, do you think will happen when the area of the brainnecessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing?Are you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary,ANH, and ME, of that part of the brain that is responsible forcontrolling the realease (albeit indirectly) of estradiol and testosterone? How do you expect anyone to do the studies on this? It's unethical to"sacrifice" humans to check out what effects chronic, acute, etc dosesof these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans.  The foodindustry knows this. That's why the animal model is used in medicineand psych.  If you're talking about straight sensitivity, it would beuseful to define the term.  There are plenty of studies onpsychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude andphysiology.I suspect we may be arguing about separate things; *only* adult sensitivities(You), and late-occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and itsimplication for adults (me).  Certainlythe doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger thanfor the young, but the additivity of Glu and Asp, and their copiousand increased presence in modern processed foods (jointly), and theirhidden presence in HVP, necessitates extreme caution. Why would anyonewant to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb theendocrine system in adults?  The main point is *blood levels*attained, and oral doses would likely have to be greater than SC. >>Between who? Over what? I would be most interested in seeing you>>provide peer-reviewed non-food-industry-funded citations to articles>>disputing that MSG has no effects whatsoever. >>You mean "asserting".  You're being intellectually dishonest (or just>plain confused), because you're conflating reports which do not necessarily>have anything to do with each other.  Olney's reports would argue a potential>for problems in human infants, but that's not to say that this says anything>whatsoever about the use of MSG in most foods, nor does he provide any>studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects (for obvious>reasons.)  It says nothing about MSG's contribtion to the phenomenon>of the "Chinese Restaurant Syndrome".  It says nothing about the frequent>inability to replicate anecdotal reports of MSG sensitivity in the lab.Olney's work provides a putative causal mechanism for somesensitivities. Terry, Epelbaum and Martin have shown that orallyadministered MSG causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormonefluctutations in adults. Glu also was found to induce immediate and persistantsupression of rhythmic GH secretion, and to induce rapid and transientrelease of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to MSG. GH isresponsible not only for control of growth during development, butalso converts glycogen into glucose. Could this be the cause ofheadaches? I don't know.>>>dyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com >>Hmm.

Just afterI completed my 4th set of deep squats.  Today was my weight trainingday and I was just beginning my routine.  All of a sudden at the end ofthe 4th set my arm felt like it had gone to sleep.  It was cold, turned pale,and lost 60% of its strength.  The weight I used for squats wasn't thatheavy, I was working hard but not at 100% effort.  I waited for a few minutes, trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued withchest exercises (flyes) with lighter dumbells than I normally use.  ButI dropped the left dumbell during the first set, and experienced continuedarm weakness into the second.  So I quit training and decided not to do myusual hour on the ski machine either.  I'll take it easy for the rest ofthe day.My arm is *still* somewhat numb and significantly weaker than normal --my hand still tingles a bit down to the thumb. Color has returned to normaland it is no longer cold. Horrid thoughts of chunks of plaque blocking a major artery course throughmy brain.  I'm 34, vegetarian, and pretty fit from my daily exerciseregimen.  So that can't be it.  Could a pinched nerve from the barcause these symptoms (I hope)?Has this happened to anyone else?Nothing like this has ever happened to me before.

In cats, the protozoan multiplies in theintestinal cells and eggs are shed in the cat's feces.  The protozoa cancross the placenta to infect the fetus.  The disease may be asymptomaticafter the baby is born, or it may be very severe.  Toxo may cause blindnessand mental retardation.Having a cat in the same apartment should not be a problem; however, pregnantwomen should not scoop or change the cat's litterbox.

We are now mapping the human genome.  We will ;then start to work on manipulation of that genome.  Using genetic;engineering, we will be able to insert whatever genes we want.;No breeding, no "hybrids", etc.  The ethical question is, should;we? Two past problems with eugenics have been 1) reducing the gene pool and 2) defining the status of the eugenized. Inserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the insertedgenes later became transmissible to progeny. Then they may be able tocrowd out "garbage genes." This may in the future become possible. Even ifit does, awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefullymean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handylater. Evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial Africaand for diabetes in the Hopi *promoted* survival in some conditions. Wedon't really know what the future may hold for our environment. Thereduced wilderness- and disease-survival capacity of our relatively inbreddomesticated animals comes to mind. Vulcanism, nuclear winter, ice age,meteor impact, new microbiological threats, famine, global warming, etc.,etc., are all conceivable. Therefore, having as many genes as possibleavailable is a good strategy for species survival.  Of course, the status of genetically altered individuals would start outas no different than anyone else's. But if we could make"philosopher-kings" with great bodies and long lives, would we (or they)want to give them elevated status? We could. The Romans did it with theirkings *without* the benefits of such eugenics. The race eventuallyrealized and dealt with the problems which that caused, but for a while,it was a problem. Orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happento persons genetically altered for more menial tasks. But there is nothingnew under the sun. We treated slaves the same way for millennia before"1984."    I see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 2problems. Humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom touse any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time. Thathasn't stopped the race as a whole yet. Many are the civilizations whichhave died from inability to adapt to environmental change. However, alsomany are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their ownpower. The ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from thefates of others, and have survived by making better choices when theirturns came. Not that I don't think that this gene altering power couldn't wipe us offthe face of the earth or cause endless suffering. Nuclear power or globalwarming or whatever could and may still do that, too.  The real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue. I personally don't thinkman has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off anybetter than he did the for last few. We, as eugenists, may make it, an wemay not. If we don't, I hope there are reservoirs of "garbage" people outin some backwater with otherwise long discarded "garbage" genes which willpull us through.  I believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same.Man needs to accept input from the great spirit of God to overcome hislacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has. Some men have,and I believe all men may, listen to and obey the still small voice of Godin their hearts. This is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtueneeded to escape the problems consequent to poor choices. Peoples havedied out for many reasons. The societies which failed to accept enoughinput from God to safely use the power they had developed have destroyedthemselves, and often others in the process. It is self-evident that theones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the Spiritto use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakesthus far, or else haven't had enough power for long enough.  In summary, I would say that the question of whether to use this newtechnology is really an ancient one. And the answer, in some ways hard, insome ways easy, is the same ancient answer. It isn't the power, it is theSpirit. Sorry for the long post. Got carried away. Bob (ruegg@med.unc.edu)

Prescribing controlled substances to patients with no    demonstrated need(other than a drug addition) for the medication.2. Prescribing thyroid preps for patients with normal thyroid    function for the purpose of quick weight loss.3. Using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has    been shown to be ineffective and dangerous(cyanide release) by    the NCI.These are errors of commission that competently trained physicians should not committ but sometimes do.  There are also errors of omission(some of which result in malpractice suits).  I don't think that using anti-fungal agents to try to relieve discomfort in a patient who you suspect may be having a problem with candida(or another fungal growth) is an error of commission or omission.  Healers have had a long history of trying to relieve human suffering.  Some have stuck to standard, approved procedures,others have been willing to try any reasonable treatment if there is a chance that it will help the patient.  The key has to be tied to the healer's oath, "I will do no harm".  But you know David that very few treatments involve no risk to the patient.  The job of the physician is a very difficult one when risk versus benefit has to be weighed.  Each physician deals with this risk/benefit paradox a little differently.  Some are very conservative while others are more agressive.  An agressive approach may be more costly to the patient and carry more risk but as long as the motive is improving the patient's health and not an attempt to rake in lots of money(through some of the schemes that have been uncovered in the medicare fraud cases), I don't see the need to label these healers as quacks or even unethical.What do I reserve the term quack for?  Pseudo-medical professionals.  These people lurk on the fringes of the health care system waiting for the frustrated patient to fall into their lair.  Some of these individuals are really doing a pretty good job of providing "alternative" medicine.  But many lack any formal training and are in the "business" simply to make a few fast bucks.   While a patient can be reasonably assured of getting competent care when a liscenced physician is consulted, this alternative care area is really a buyer's beware arena.  If you are lucky, you may find someone who can help you.  If you are unlucky, you can loose a lot of money and develop severe disease because of the inability of these pseudo-medical professional to diagnose disease(which is the fortay of the liscened physicians).I hope that this clears things up David.Marty B.

Determined to find out the cause of my first reaction, Iwent back to the Chinese restuarant and ordered the same dish.  Thesame thing happened.

Here are some observations gained frompainful experience:  1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.     Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more     sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.  2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear     that these things will itch for months.  3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of     it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,     since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could     find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC's special     collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is     required to get it.  4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old     folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work.  I recall     reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers     burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I     think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some     sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.  5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.     A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally     applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is     another preparation called "Chig Away" that is a combination of     sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was     prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In     the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get     up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where we     live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They     apparently don't like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur     as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)  6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget     the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment     that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone     creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine     (relieves the itch).  I won't tell you all the things I've tried.     Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this     counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think     it gains nothing).  7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved     by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery     as well.Doctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburbandoctors apparently don't encounter them much.  And the rural doctorsseem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  Isuspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggerswould make a *lot* of money.-- Gary H.

Although not many patients with Hep B go on tochronic hepatitis, it does still occur in a good number (20%?) and issomething to keep in mind.  Hepatitis C (was: non-A, non-B Hep) muchmore frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis.  There is also anautimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women whichalso leads to cirrhosis.  Of course, cirrhosis is a most unkind disease.  The most dangerouseffects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function. Patients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas,among many other problems, as a result of disturbances in hepaticcirculation.  Less ominously, they can exhibit the effects ofhyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis. These effects include telangiactasias (small red skin lesions) and, inmen, gynecomastia (breast development).  The only real treatment forcirrhosis is liver transplant.Keep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected, at least statistically, inyour friend's case.  Nevertheless you might want to bring up thesubject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor.  Hopefully heor she can then carefully explain these sequelae of Hep B infection toyou, and offer you support.Simon.

The drastic change of environmentwill often unmask how marginally they have been coping at home. Evenyoung people find the change unsettling.Though we have thought that this decrement in function after - say -anaesthesia and surgery for a fractured hip (a common event in theelderly) was due to anaesthesia there is good evidence that thechange of situation is much more important. Some hospitals havetried a 'rapid transit' system for hip fractures, aiming to have thepatient back at home within 24 hours of admission. The selection ofthe anaesthetic has no effect on the ability to discharge thesepatients early.Anaesthetists who work with the elderly (which is almost all of us)generally take care to tailor the choice and dose of drugs used tothe individual patient. Even so, there is some evidence that fullmental recovery may take a surprisingly long time to return. This isthe sort of thing which is detected by setting quite difficulttasks, not the gross change that the original poster noted.Haloperidol (Haldol TM) is a long acting drug. The plasma half lifeof the drug is up to 35 hours. If the decanoate (a sort of slowrelease formulation) is used it may be weeks. The elderly aresensitive to haloperidol for a number of reasons. Without knowingmore it is hard to comment.Don Mackie - his opinionsesiology will disavow...

As many knowledgeable people have pointed out, msg is a naturally occurring substance in a lot, if not most, foods.  When food manufacturers add it to a preparation, they do so because it's a known flavor enhancer. Your wife's theory, that MSG is added to food to stimulate appetite, may well be true.  But I don't believe it's ALWAYS the reason it's added.

I couldn't remember doing anything that would havecaused it.  That is, I hadn't been lifting more than other people do,and in fact probably somewhat less.  Eventually the thing became morepainful and I had the repair operation.This year I developed a pain on the other side.  This turned out to beanother inguinal hernia.  So I go back to the hospital Monday foranother fun 8-) operation.I don't know of anything I'm doing to cause this to happen.  I'm 38years old and I don't think I'm old enough for things to start fallingapart like this.  The surgeon who is doing the operation seems tosuspect a congenital weakness, but if so, why did it suddenly appearwhen I was 37 and not really as active as I was when I was younger?Does anyone know how to prevent a hernia, other than not liftinganything?

I am hoping that the arrival of (1)Spring Break, and (2) College Acceptance Letters, will help.  *UNFORTUNATELY*she was wait-listed at the college she most dearly wanted to attend, so itseems as though that stressor may just continue for a while.  :-(Meanwhile she is going on a camping trip with her religious youth group forspring break, which seems like a good stress-reliever to me.Thanks again for everybody's help/advice/suggestions/ideas.------------------------Ruth Ginzberg <rginzberg@eagle.wesleyan.edu>Philosophy Department;Wesleyan University;USA

Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized "jargon",necessary for precise communication within their field (which I'm fullycognizant of since I, too, speak "jargonese" when with my peers).  For thesituation in sci.med, many times the words or phrases used by doctors canhave a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in theworld at large, causing significant miscommunication.  One example word,and very relevant to the yeast discussion, is the exact meaning of "systemic".It is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific, muchmore so than its meaning to a non-doctor.  There is also the observation ofthis newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentiallyequal terms, which, when combined with the jargon issue, can further fanthe flames.  This is probably the first time that practicing doctors getreally "beat up" by non-doctors for their views on medicine, which theyotherwise don't see much of in their practice except for the occasional"difficult" patient.Point 2:I understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will notprescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatmentshave been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructedclinical trials (usually double-blind), or that such treatments/therapies arepart of an approved and funded clinical trial.  To these doctors, to do anydifferently would, in this belief system, be unethical practice.  And itfollows that any therapy not on the "accepted" list is therefore a non-therapy - it does not even exist, nor does the underlying hypothesis ortheory have any validity, even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolationof what is currently known.  Anecdotal evidence has no value, either, froma treatment point-of-view.And by and large, as a scientist myself, I am glad that medical practice/science takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment.  However, asalso being a human being (last I checked), and having been one of those peoplethat has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment, where"standard" medicine was not able to help me, has caused me to sit back andwonder if holding such an extreme and rigid "scientific" viewpoint is initself unethical from humanitarian considerations.  After all, the underlyingintent of the "scientific" approach to medicine is to protect the health ofthe patient by providing the best possible care for the patient, so thepatient should come first when considering treatment.What we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies boththe "scientific" and the "humanitarian" viewpoints.  In an earlier post Ioutlined a crazy idea for doing just that.  The gist of it was to give anyphysician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribealternate, not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidence)for patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted(and not until then).  The patient would be fully informed that suchtherapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and thatthere are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derivedfrom them.This approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor.  It also satisfiesthe humanitarian needs of the patient.  And the reality is that many patientswho have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using acceptedmedicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community:  either to thedoctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losingtheir license, or worse, to non-doctors who have not had the proper medicaltraining.  This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the controlmore within orthodox medicine, with the benefits that the information gleanedcould help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the mostproductive way.  Everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - I'msure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presentedmore as a strawman to stimulate discussion.Hopefully what I write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as towhy I am "open" to alternative therapies, as well as why I have realdifficulty (read "apparent hostility") with the "coldness" of the 99.9% pure"scientific" approach to medicine.  I believe the best approach to medicaltreatment is one where both the "humanitarian" aspects are balanced with andby the "scientific" aspects.  Anything else is just not good medicine, imho.Just my 'NF' leanings, I guess.  :^)Comments?Jon Noring-- Charter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.If you're dying to know what INFJ means, be brave, e-mail me, I'll send info.=============================================================================| Jon Noring          | noring@netcom.com        |                          || JKN International   | IP    : 192.100.81.100   | FRED'S GOURMET CHOCOLATE || 1312 Carlton Place  | Phone : (510) 294-8153   | CHIPS - World's Best!    || Livermore, CA 94550 | V-Mail: (510) 417-4101   |                          |=============================================================================Who are you?

Inparticular, Dr. Bernard Jenssen in his book "Colon Cleansing forHealth and Longevity" -- the title actually escapes me, but it is verysimilar to that -- claims that regular self-administered colonics,along with certain orally ingested "debris-loosening agents", booststhe immune system to a significant degree.He also plugs a unique appliance called the "Colema Board", whichfacilitates the self-administration of colonics.  It sells for over$100 from a California-based company.  He also plugs Vitra-Toxproducts as his chemical agents of choice: these include volcanic ash,supposedly for its electrical charge, and psyllium powder, for itsbulkiness.If anyone knows anything about colon cleansing theory, itsparticulars, or the Colema Board and related products, I'd be veryinterested to hear about research and personal experience.This article is crossposted to alt.magick as the issue touches uponfasting and cleansing through a "ritual" system of purification.-- Eli-- /-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\![wiesel@cs.yale.edu] Elisha Wiesel, Davenport College '94 Yale University!    ![wiesel@minerva.cis.yale.edu] (203) 436-1338<-School (212) 371-2756<-Home!\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------/

[...]B >  Marty B. Marty, I personally wouldn't be so quick and take that NEJM article  on kidney stones as gospel. First of all, I would want to know who sponsored that study. I have seen too many "nutrition" bulletins over the years from local newspapers, magazines, to TV-guide, with disclaimers on the bottom informing us that this great health news was brought to us compliments of the Dairy Industries. There are of course numerous other interest groups now that thrive financially on the media hype created from the supposedly enormous  benefits of increasing one's calcium intake. Secondly, were ALL the kidney stones of the test subjects involved  in that project analysed for their chemical composition?  The study didn't say that, it only claimed that "most kidney stones are large- ly calcium." Perhaps it won't be long before another study comes up with the exact opposite findings. A curious phenomenon with researchers is that they are oftentimes just plain wrong. It wouldn't be the first time.  Sodium/magnesium/calcium/phosphorus ratios are, in my opinion, still  the most reliable indicators for the cause, treatment, and prevention  of kidney stones. I, for one, will continue to recommend the most logical changes in one's diet or through supplementation to counteract or prevent kidney stones of either type; and they definitely won't include an INCREASE in calcium if the stones have been identified as being of the calcium type and people's chemical analysis confirms that they would benefit from a PHOSPHORUS-raising approach instead!

[Some kinds might work better that others.]               (2) Divide the sample into two groups of equal weight                    and number.               (3) Sprout one group in distilled water on filter paper                    for three or four weeks.               (4) Separately incinerate both groups.               (5) Weigh the residue from each group.  [The residue of                    the sprouted group will usually weigh at least                    SEVERAL PERCENT MORE than the other group.]               (6) Analyze quantitatively the residue of each group for                    mineral content.  [Some of the mineral atoms of the                    sprouted group have been TRANSMUTED into heavier                    mineral elements by FUSING with atoms of oxygen,                    hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, etc..]                         BIOLOGICAL TRANSMUTATIONS occur ROUTINELY, even in our           own bodies.                          Ingesting a source of organic silicon (silicon with           carbon, such as "horsetail" extract, or radishes) can SPEED           HEALING OF BROKEN BONES via the reaction Si + C --> Ca, (much           faster than by merely ingesting the calcium directly).                           Some MINERAL DEPOSITS in the ground are formed by micro-          organisms FUSING together atoms of silicon, carbon, nitrogen,           oxygen, hydrogen, etc..                          The two reactions Si + C <--> Ca, by micro-organisms,           cause "STONE SICKNESS" in statues, building bricks, etc..                           The reaction N2 --> CO, catalysed by very hot iron,           creates a CARBON-MONOXIDE POISON HAZARD for welder operators           and people near woodstoves (even properly sealed ones).

Serious business.  They wanted to doa lumbar puncture, for which a CT scan is a prerequisite.I arrived in her hospital room about an hour after she had returnedfrom the CT.   She was in tears.  Evidently the technicians in the CTlab had been very unpleasant to her.To begin with, they put her on the apparatus that moves you into themachine itself, and just pushed a button to slide her straight into themachine, without any explanation.  Imagine this.  You worried you mayhave a deadly disease, and next thing you know you're being put intothis big scary machine, without a word of explanation about what isgoing to happen to you.  I believe this is inexcusable.   She waved herhand as if to say what are you doing to me, and they responded withannoyance and anger.  Next they inserted, or tried to insert, an IVcatheter.  Apparently she has a lot of trouble with these and complainedof the pain.  The technician just stopped and fixed her with a glarewithout any words of explanation.Is there anything I can do about these pigs ?I realize that these technicians do this sort of job day in and dayout.  And that some patients can be very irritating and uncooperative.But this is simply no excuse.  Their purpose for existing is to helpsick people, and there is no excuse for this sort of behavior.Fortunately my friend is fine.  But I imagine a large proportion of thepeople who get CT scans are not fine at all.  They have cancer and thatsort of thing.  They don't need this kind of shit.Also, since I named the hospital involved, I should also point out thatneither she nor I have any complaints about the competence or compassionof any of the other personnel at NCMH.Thanks for listening,John Eylesjge@cs.unc.edu

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port        2. X terminals        3. NeXT        4. Silicon Graphics        5. IBM RS/60006. Other stuff    1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial portIf you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard(Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time findinga vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstationruns the X window system, you're in luck.  You can buy a cheap usedPC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cableto your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to readthe serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.The two main programs I've found to do this are KT and A2X.a2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, andeven moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a serverextension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if yourserver can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these stringsappear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn't have this,you may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,or bugging your vendor.kt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.Another program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven't seen it.Both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.    2. X terminalsAlso, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) usePC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be allset.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through thetrouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals addextra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard aroundfor the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.    3. NeXTNeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple DesktopBus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced theywere cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind ofupgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!    4. Silicon GraphicsSilicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 andbeyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don'tbelieve this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It's notpossible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except byupgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for moredetails.    5. IBM RS/6000IBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||Unfortunately, you can't just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||cable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||smaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||it or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||works.  However, they don't want me to redistribute it.  I've been  ||told Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn ||anything new, please send me e-mail.    ||        6. Other stuffSome vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)support some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to yourqueries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you canget sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (eitherfrom the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be inluck.  Contact the companies for more details.Apple Adjustable Keyboard    Apple Computer, Inc.    Sales offices all over the place.    Availability: February, 1993    Price: $219    Supports: Mac only    Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard.  The    keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate    backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The keys are    arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion.    The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard.    A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.    The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not    directly attachable to the keyboard.    As soon as soda comes back up, I'll have a detailed blurb from    TidBITS available there.FlexPro Keyboard    Key Tronic    Phone: 800-262-6006    Possible contact: Denise Razzeto, 509-927-5299    Sold by many clone vendors and PC shops    Availability: Spring, 1993 (?)    Price: $489 (?)    Supports: PC only (highly likely)    Keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at Comdex.  It's    another split-design.  One thumb-wheel controls the tilt of both    the left and right-hand sides of the main alphanumeric section.    The arrow keys and keypad resemble a normal 101-key PC keyboard.    Keytronic makes standard PC keyboards, also, so this product will    probably be sold through their standard distribution channels.DragonDictate-30K (and numerous other Dragon products)    Dragon Systems, Inc.    320 Nevada Street    Newton, MA  02160    Phone: 800-TALK-TYP or 617-965-5200    Fax: 617-527-0372    Shipping: Now.

The program is called a2x, and isavailable via anonymous ftp:soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/a2x.tar.Zexport.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/a2x.tar.Z (most current)If you want to use your Dragon product with X windows, you may wantto ask for Peter Cohen, an salesman at Dragon who knows more aboutthis sort of thing.    Dragon Systems sells a number of voice recognition products.    Most (if not all) of them seem to run on PC's and compatibles    (including PS/2's and other MicroChannel boxes).  They sell you    a hardware board and software which sits in front of a number    of popular word processors and spreadsheets.    Each user `trains' the system to their voice, and there are provisions    to correct the system when it makes mistakes, on the fly.  Multiple    people can use it, but you have to load a different personality file    for each person.  You still get the use of your normal keyboard, too.    On the DragonDictate-30K you need to pause 1/10th sec between    words.  Dragon claims typical input speeds of 30-40 words per minute.    I don't have specs on the DragonWriter 1000.    The DragonDictate-30K can recognize 30,000 words at a time.    The DragonWriter 1000 can recognize (you guessed it) 1000 words at a time.

Despite appearances, the key layout resembles    QWERTY, and is reported to be no big deal to adapt to.  The idea is    that your hands never have to move to use the keyboard.  The whole pod    tilts in its base, to act as a mouse.

The hardware design is relativelyeasy for the company to re-configure.    Price: $690, including one system "personality module".    ||    The idea is that one keyboard works with everything.  You purchase    "compatibility modules", a new cord, and possibly new keycaps, and    then you can move your one keyboard around among different machines.    It's a three-piece folding keyboard.  The layout resembles the    standard 101-key keyboard, except sliced into three sections.  Each    section is on a "custom telescoping universal mount."  Each section    independently adjusts to an infinite number of positions allowing each    individual to type in a natural posture.  You can rearrange the three    sections, too (have the keypad in the middle if you want).  Each    section is otherwise normal-shaped (i.e.: you put all three sections    flat, and you have what looks like a normal 101-key keyboard).Kinesis Ergonomic Keyboard   206-455-9220    206-455-9233 (fax)    Kinesis Corporation    15245 Pacific Highway South,    Seattle, Washington 98188, U.S.A.

The $690 includes one footpedal, one set of adhesive wrist pads, and a TypingTutor program.An additional foot pedal and other accessories are extra.    The layout has a large blank space in the middle, even though the    keyboard is about the size of a normal PC keyboard -- slightly    smaller.  Each hand has its own set of keys, laid out to minimize    finger travel.  Thumb buttons handle many major functions (enter,    backspace, etc.).    You can remap the keyboard in firmware (very nice when software won't    allow the reconfig).    Foot pedals are also available, and can be mapped to any key on the    keyboard (shift, control, whatever).Maltron(+44) 081 398 3265 (United Kingdom)    P.C.D.

Soft rubber keys, which rock    forward and backward (each key has three states), make chords for    typing keys.  Learning time is estimated to be 2-3 hours, for getting    started, and maybe two weeks to get used to it.    Currently, the thumbs don't do anything, although a thumb-trackball    is in the works.     The company claims it takes about a week of work to support a    new computer.

When in "mouse" mode, tilting the Twiddler moves the mouse, and mouse    buttons are on your fingers.    The cabling leaves your normal keyboard available, also.

Letting one's mind roamfreely and giving rein to one's intuition can be a useful way of comingup with new ideas, but only when one has done a lot of rational analysisof the problem first.  Scientific intuition is not something one is born with.  It is somethingthat one learns.  Maybe we don't understand completely how it is learned,but training in systematic scientific thinking is certainly one of the key elements in developing it.  Informal exploration is also often an important element in finding newscientific ideas.  One thinks, for instance, of Darwin's naturalisticstudies in the Galapagos islands, which led him to the ideas for the theory of evolution.  This is why I am offended by a definition of science that emphasizesempirical verification and does not recognize thinking and informalexploration as important scientific work.  I agree that mere speculationdoes not deserve to be called science.  I also think that mere empiricalstudies not directed by good scientific thinking are at best a verypoor kind of science.

Burzynski says that his work has met with hostility in the United States, despite the favorable responses of his subjects during clinical trials.What is the generally accepted opinion of Dr. Burzynski's research?  He paints himself as a lone researcher with a new breakthrough battling an intolerant medical establishment, but I have no basis from which to judge his claims.  Two weeks ago, however, I read that the NIH's Department of Alternative Medicine has decided to focus their attention on Burzynski's work.

It may beimpossible to know much about Toricelli's thoughts; that's too bad ifit is so.  One of Root-Bernstein's services to science is that he has gonerooting about in Pasteur's and Fleming's (and other people's) notes, and hasdiscovered some surprising clues about their motivations.  Pasteur neverpublicly admitted his plan to create mirror-image life, but the dreams areright there in his notebooks (finally public after many years), ready foranyone to read.  And I and my friends often have the most ridiculousreasons for pursuing results; one of my best came because I was mad ata colleague for a poorly-written claim (I disproved the claim).Of course, Toricelli's case may be an example of a rarety: where thefantasy not only motivates the experiment, but turns out to be rightin the end.Mark-- Mark A.

One problem isthat cells in the sample continue to metabolize glucose after thesample is drawn, reducing the apparent level.

She would touch her head and strands of hair wouldjust fall right out. (by the way, she is 29 or 30 years old).  It continued to occur until she had a bald spot about thesize of a half dollar.  Since that time, she  has gotten twomore bald spots of the same size.  Other symptoms she'sdescribed include:  several months of an irregular menstrualcycle (which is strange for her, because she has always beenextremely regular); laryngitis every few days -- she will wakeup one morning and have almost no voice, and then the next dayit's fine; dizzy spells -- she claims that she's had 4 or 5very bad dizzy spells early in the morning, including one thatknocked her to the ground; and general fatigue.She went to a dermatologist first who couldn't find any reasonfor the symptoms and sent her to an internist who suspectedthyroid problems.  He did the blood work and claims that everythingcame back normal.  She's very concerned and very confused.  Does anyone have anyideas or suggestions?  I told her that I thought she shouldsee an endocrinologist.  Does that sound like the right idea?** By the way, in case you are going to ask...no, she has recentlytaken any medications that would cause these symptoms...no, she hasn'trecently changed her hair products and she hasn't gotten a perm, coloring, or other chemical process that might cause hair to fallout.Thanks in advance for any help!

A single dose of acetaminophen of 10 grams or greatercan cause hepatotoxicity, and doses of 25 grams or more arepotentially fatal from hepatic necrosis.  If I recallcorrectly, the metabolism of acetaminophen at high dosesinvolves N-hydroxylation to N-acetyl-benzoquinoneimine, whichis a highly reactive intermediate, which then reacts withsulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione.  When hepaticglutathione is used up, this intermediate then startsattacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepaticnecrosis.  The insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is thedelay (2-4 days) between ingestion and clinical signs of liverdamage.  This is NOT a nice way to die.As to taking 20-30 of these tablets, that comes to 5-7.5 gramsof acetaminophen.  In a normal adult, this would probablycause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite.Bob Schmieg

Med. Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did not exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.  Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicians who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go from doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and then when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling quack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn't help Elaine or Jonbut somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be a quack.  I've been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten years now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were raised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to entering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is about 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition either tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That's okay because I know that some of what I'm teaching is going to stick and there will be at least a few "enlightened" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It's really too bad that most U.S. medical schools don't cover nutrition because if they did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the medical profession.In animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with "good" bacteria after antibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not have a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with "good" bacteria is needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all kinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune system is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up residence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling Elaine's doctor a quack.Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly called, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsiblefor this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a yeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis.Candidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it requires that the host immune system be severly depressed.  Candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposingfactor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral course of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain much higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in it's food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In diabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little buggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to the candida or not isn't certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on the skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to "treat" it.If it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty nondiscript.  Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless they broach the mucus membrane "barrier".  If they do, an inflammatory response will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A from their diets.  About 30% of all American's die with less Vitamin A than they were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane barrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom.  While diabetics can suffer from a candida "bloom" the  most common cause of this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main competition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.But even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by the excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of the problem is addressed(lack of a "good" bacterial flora in the body and/or poor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective therapy for candida overgrowth.  From it's name, it is an acid loving organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not grow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is the predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum antibiotics).  In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the bloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology occurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first place.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong but her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant basis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it's nice to know that I don't have colon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.Candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline during a woman's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina. Vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal problems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of Lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of the purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting scripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had the same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some digging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she used in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex returned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his patients is a non-existent syndrome.The nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.  If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through aresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes.But before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system needs to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and some of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans are not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent disorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy). Some of the above material was obtained from "Natural Healing" by Mark Bricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human nutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in the future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely important role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida blooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI system is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it's not going to out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and fatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check once carbohydrate is returned to the gut.If Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post, fine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitamin A and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice from newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content.  If you saved your venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly seeking help alone, I wouldn't have a problem with your behavior.

I stated that psychotherapy (meaning talking therapy and so on) was used     to treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, which though sometimes true is     misleading.  It is not often found effective, particularly by itself.    Primary treatment today usually consists at least in part of drug    therapy.  The most current theories of this condition attribute     it to more to biological causes than psychological, in places where this    distinction becomes important.2.  I mentioned that the DSM-IIIR mentions 'impulses' as a possible diagnostic marker.  However, this might look like somethingpeople associate with psychotic conditions, uncontrollable orunpredictable behaviors, which is NOT the case with OCD.  One of the diagnostic criteria of OCD is that the individualcan and does suppress some of their 'impulses,' although theyare an unending source of anxiety.  The obsessive thoughts and ritualistic actions usually associated with OCD are most frequently very mundane and predictable, closer toa superstitious nature than a dangerous nature for the most part.Some references (one non-technical and several technical)that someone was kind enough to supply for mebut was unable to post themself :|"The boy who couldn't stop washing" by judith rapaport.   ***(technical refs) :|pharmacotherapy of o-c disorder|donna m jermain and lynn crismon|pharmacotherapy 1990; 10(3):175-198|epidemiology of ocd|seteven a rasmussen and jane eisen|j clin psychiatry 1990;51(2, suppl.):10-13|the waking nightmare: an overview of ocd|judith l rapoport|j clin psychiatry 1990; 51(11, suppl.):25-28|absence of placebo response in ocd|matig r mavissakalian, bruce jones, stephen olson|j nerv ment disease 1990 vol 178 no. 4And thanks very much to those who supplied constructive  criticism to my first post on OCD.

The following is from a critique of a "60 Minutes" presentation on MSG   which was aired on November 3rd, 1991.  The critique comes from THE TUFTS   DIET AND NUTRITION LETTER, February 1992.  [...edited for brevity...]"Chances are good that if you watched '60 Minutes' last November3rd [1991], you came away feeling MSG is bad for you. [...] Inthe segment entitled 'No MSG,' for instance, show host Ed Bradleymakes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them('millions are suffering a host of symptoms, and some get violentlysick'); peppers his report with sensational but clinically unprovenpersonal testimony...; and speaks of studies on MSG that make thesubstance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive those studies are.Consider his making reference at the beginning of the program toa study conducted at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in orderto back up his comment that there is 'a lot of evidence' that MSG,a flavor enhancer in Chinese and other Asian cuisines as well asin many supermarket items, causes headaches.  What he does NOTmake reference to is the fact that the study was performed not onhumans but on rabbits.One of the researchers who conducted the study, pharmacologistPatricia Williams, Ph.D., says it certainly is conceivable thata small minority of people are sensitive enough to MSG to get headaches from it.  'But,' she explains, 'the show probably overemphasized the extent of the problem.'A second lapse comes with mention of Dr. John Olney, a professorat the Washington University School of Medicine who, Mr. Bradleyremarks, 'says that his 20 years of research with laboratoryanimals shows MSG is a hazard for developing youngsters' becauseit poses a threat of irreversible brain damage.  Dr. Olney'sresearch with lab animals does not 'show' anything about humanyoungsters.In fact, only under extreme circumsrtances did Dr. Olney's experiments ever bring about any brain damage: when he injectedextremely high doses of MSG into rodents, completely bypassing their digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly,and when he used tubes to force-feed huge amounts of the substanceto very young animals on an empty stomach.  Of course, neitherof those procedures occurs with humans; they simply take in MSG with food.  And most of what they take in is broken down byenzymes in the wall of the small intestine, so that very littlereaches the bloodstream -- much to little, in fact, for humanblood levels of MSG to come anywhere near the high concentrationsfound in Dr. Olney's lab animals.....The World Health Organization appears to be very much aware ofthat fact.  And so does the European Communities' ScientificCommittee for Food....Both, after examining numerous studies,have concluded that MSG is safe.Their determination makes sense, considering that MSG has neverbeen proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributedto it -- headaches, swelling, a tightness in the chest, and aburning sensation, among others.  In fact, the most fail-safeof clinical studies, the double-blind study..., has consistentlyexonerated the much-maligned substance.That's quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component ofmonosodium glutamate, glutamate, enters our systems wheneverwe eat any food that contains protein.  The reason is that oneof the amino acids that make up protein, glutamic acid, is brokendown into glutamate during digestion.It's a breakdown that occurs frequently.  Glutamic acid is themost abundant of the 20 or so amino acids in the diet.  It makesup about 15 percent of the protein in flesh foods, 20 percent inmilk, 25 percent in corn, and 29 percent in whole wheat.That doesn't mean it's entirely unimaginable that a small numberof people have trouble metabolizing MSG properly and are thereforesensitive to it...The consensus reached by large, internationalprofessional organizations [is that MSG is safe], the same consensusreached by the FDA and the biomedical community at large."-Rich Young (These are not Kodak's opinions.)

If her current physicianis unwilling to do this, find one who will.  Either check the phone book for a physician who specializes in geriatric medicine or gerontology, or contact a physician referral line or the American Medical Society.By finding a geriatric specialist, he (she) will more likely be in tunewith the special needs of elderly adults and maybe can help.

Too much can block theexternal auditory canal (the hole in the outside of the ear) and cause some hearing problems.  It is very simple, and safe, to remove excess wax on yourown, or at your physician's office.  You can take a syringe (no needles!) andfill it with 50% warm water (cold can cause fainting) and 50% OTC hydrogenperoxide.  Then point the ear towards the ceiling ( about 45 degrees up)and insert the tip of the syringe (helps to have someone else do this!) and  firmly expell the solution.  Depending on the size of the syringe and thetenacity of the wax, this could take several rinses.  If you place a bowl under the ear to catch the water, it will be much drier :-).  You can buya syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy, or just use whateveryou may have.  If wax is old, it will be harder, and darker.  You can tryadding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften upthe wax.  Do this for a couple days, then try syringing again.  It is alsosafe to point your ear up at the shower head, and allow the water to rinseit out.Good Luck-heather

Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.  It runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett Packard Scanners.  When initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options; (1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3) automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image. I like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which parts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.Once an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The software gives you two "errors" at this point.  Blue which are words that were converted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.  Yellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn't think it converted correctly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more credit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue, you can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal dictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited, considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary. After a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word processor formats.  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a seperate TIFF or PCX file format.I was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.  I use HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993an Intel Satisfaxtion card, which stores incoming faxs in a PCX/DCX format.  While most of my faxes were received in "standard" mode (200x100 dpi), the accuracy of Wordscan Plus was excellent. Overall, a very impressive product.  The only fault I could find is the limitations of the size of the user dictionary.  200 specialized words is just too small. If anyone has any specific questions, please do not hesitate to send me email.HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  2Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::               Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - MMWR::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::                         Emerging Infectious Diseases                         ============================                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(14)   DATE: Apr 16, 1993                                 Introduction     Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would soon be eliminated as a public health problem (1), infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the United States. Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., Escherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, Legionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, malaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore, control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, salmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those in institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and minority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of emerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs (3).      This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, "Emerging Infectious Diseases." Future articles will address these diseases, as well as surveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and public health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation of an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4). References1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

This report summarizes the findings from an ongoing investigation (1) that identified a multistate outbreak resulting from consumption of hamburgers from one restaurant chain. Washington      On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of Health a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an increase in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a case-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or postdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls implicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset (matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January 18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants was initiated.      As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January-February 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the state health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case definition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS (Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of symptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A restaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients who recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating a regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17 through January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30 developed HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years (range: 0-74 years). Idaho      Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December 11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were hospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13 (93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California      In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was notified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died. Active surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with E. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993. Four of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993four at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was reported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27% increase in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January 1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with onset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993.      Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The outbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen persons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median age of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of the first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched OR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients who ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular-sized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3). Chain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada      On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten at a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District issued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea contact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness with a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with onset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local laboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools for E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After SMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of one patient 38 days after illness onset.      Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine were hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range: 0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex-matched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during the week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients also implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7-49.8). Other Investigation Findings      During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases primarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November 19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in "jumbo" patties produced on November 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11 lots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed to restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672 (20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall.      A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the United States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993contaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing the likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter plants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one slaughter plant or farm was identified as the source.      Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in families and child day care settings is ongoing.

Editorial Note: E. coli O157:H7 is a pathogenic gram-negative bacterium first identified as a cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers (2). This pathogen has since emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common cause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other food vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been implicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7 that organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10 participating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a higher rate than for any other pathogen.      Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993SMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses associated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea (often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and complications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients develop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%.      This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite the magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington (1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from persons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5). When infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported to local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public health action to prevent further cases.      E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can contaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service to identify critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce the likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply. Because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with pathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens from the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be internally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices are clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played an important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to 155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993).      Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of outbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections caused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E. coli O157:H7.

Long-term use of smokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of oral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who currently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1). To monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products, CDC's 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease Prevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing tobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This report summarizes findings from this survey.      The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked "Have you used snuff at least 20 times in your entire life?" and "Do you use snuff now?" Similar questions were asked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of smokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco use at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the time of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having used snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the time of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and former users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at least 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as those who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not smoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on smokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or equal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide national estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using standard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (3).      In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users of smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%) women. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was highest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was highest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan Natives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American Indians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of smokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was substantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in rural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993men and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only for women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1).      Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those aged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of chewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although women rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years.      An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being former smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were former smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons aged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users (56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95% CI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users was similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5% 95% CI=68.9-78.1).      Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0) currently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95% CI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95% CI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco.      Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3% 95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6-49.6). Reported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National Center for Health Statistics, CDC. Editorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless tobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in particular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that link smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for nicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4).      Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among racial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require further explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6).      In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current smokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco users than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous study among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993occasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked reported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to stop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health implications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use.      The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special population target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year 2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more than 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless tobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts, enforcing laws that restrict minors' access to tobacco, making excise taxes commensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to routinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based prevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit tobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5).

While most work in hospitals and clinics, many major cities will have RD's who are in "private practice" so to speak.  Many physicans will refer their patients with Crohn's disease to RD's for dietary help.  If you can get your friend's physician to make a referral, medical insurance should pay for the RD's services just like the services of a physical therapist.  The better medical insurance plans will cover this but even if your friend's plan doesn't, it would be well worth the cost to get on a good diet to control the intestinal discomfort and help the intestinal lining heal.Crohn's disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestinal lining and lipoxygenase inhibitors may help by decreasing leukotriene formation but I'm not aware of tea or turmeric containing lipoxygenase inhibitors.  For bad inflammation, steroids are used but for a mild case, the side effects are not worth the small benefit gained by steroid use.  Upjohn is developing a new lipoxygenase inhibitor that should greatly help deal with inflammatory diseases but it's not available yet.Marty B.

Would that many patients be able to tell whatcauses them problems.  The digestive processing idea is changing, butif a food causes problems, avoid them.  Be sure that the foods are tested a second time to be sure the food is a real cause.  Crohn'scommonly causes intermittent symptoms and some patients end up withseverly restricted diets that take months to renormalize.There was a good article in the CCFA newsletter recently that discussedthe issue of dietary restriction of fiber.  It would be worth readingto anyone with an interest in Crohn's.And, as I always say when dealing with Crohn's, as does Spencer, Good Luck!Steve Holland

Med. Nutrition and I'm posting my answer here.  Only 22 medical schools in the U.S. teach courses on human nutrition.  We have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can do when candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical community.I think that the best example of where U.S. medicine is really missing the mark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is PMS.  So many women(and their husbands) suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal that most physicians in the U.S. are not taught that PMS is primarily caused by diet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening.  Before shooting your flames, read the entire article and then decide if flaming is justified.From A Poster In Sci. Medi. Nutrition:> In a psychological anthropology course I am taking, we got > sidetracked onto a short conversation about PMS.  Some rumors shared> by several of the students included ideas that vitamin levels, sugar> intake, and caffeine intake might affect PMS symptoms.> Is there any data on this, or is it just so much hooey?> > Many thanks,> > Michael, I've wanted to reply to this post ever since I saw it but I got side-tracked with candida.  PMS is a lot like Candida blooms, most physicians don't recognize it as a specific "disease" entity.  Here is everything that you would ever want to know about PMS.Premenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups:PMT-A(Anxiety)PMT-D(depression)anxietydepressionirritabilityforgetfulnessinsomniaconfusiondepressionlethargyPMT-C(Craving)PMT-H(Hyperhydration)craving for sweetsweight gainincreased appetitebreast congestion and tendernesssugar ingestion causes: abdominal bloating and tenderness 1. headacheedema of the face and extremities 2. palpitations 3. fatigue or fainting PMT-A is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low progesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women's cycle.PMT-C is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple carbohydrates.  During the luteal phase of a women's cycle, there is increased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose challenge.  The metabolic findings believed to be responsible for PMT-C are a low magnesium and a low prostaglandin E1.  This condition of hypoglycemia is not unique to PMS but there are a number of different causes of hypoglycemia, magnesium and PGE1 seem to be specific to PMS hypoglycemia.A. Am. J. Psychiatry 147(4):477-80(1990).Unrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar, magnesium supplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementation(increased to 5-6% of the total calories) using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sources of alpha linoleic acid.PMT-D is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal phase of a women's cycle.  Another cause of PMT-D has been found to be lead toxicity(in women without elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal phase). "Effect of metal ions on the binding of estridol to human endometrial cystol" Fertil. Steril. 28:312-18(1972).PMT-H is associated with water and salt retention along with an elevated serum aldosterone level.  Salt restriction, B6, magnesium and vitamin E for breast tenderness have all been effective in treating PMT-HThis general discussion of the PMS syndromes came form:A. "Management of the premenstrual tension sundromes: Rational for     a nutritional approach". 1986, A Year in Nutritional Medicine.     J. Bland, Ed. Keats, Publishing, 1986.B. "Nutritional factors in the etiology of premenstrual tension     syndromes", J. Reprod. Med.28(7):446-64(1983).C. "Premenstrual tension", Prob. Obstet. Gynecol. 3(12):1-39(1980)Treatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you can find a doctor who will treat you for PMS(just about as hard as finding one that will treat you for candida blooms).  While progesterone will work, supplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better.  There really has been an awful lot of research done on PMS(much more than candida blooms).  Many of these studies have been what are called experimental controlled studies(the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to see done).Here are a few of these studies:CARBOHYDRATE: Experimental Controlled Study, "Effect of a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy" Lancet 2:128-32(1988).  21 pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy of at least 5 years duration were randomly selected to receive specific training to reduce dietary fat to 15% of total calories and increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary advise with no training.  After 6 months, there was a significant reduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in the trained group as reported by self-reported symptoms as well as physical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling, tenderness and nodularity.VITAMIN A: Experimental Controlled Study, "The use of Vitamin A in premenstrual tension" Acta Obstet. Gynecol Scand. 39:586-92(1960).  218 pts with severe recurring PMS received 200,000 to 300,000IU vitamin A daily or a placebo.  Serum retinol levels were monitored and high dose supplementation was discontinued when evidence of toxicity occured(serum retinol above 450ug/ml).  The intent of the study was to load the liver up with vitamin A and get a normal pool size(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU) and then see if this normal vitamin A pool could prevent PMS.  48% getting the high dose vitamin A had complete remission of the symptoms of PMS.  Only 10% getting the placebo reported getting complete relief of PMS sysmptoms.  10% of the vitamin A treated group reported no improvement in PMS symptoms.Experimental Controlled Study, "Premenstrual tension treated with vitamin A" J. Clinical Endocrinology 10:1579-89(1950). 30 pts received 200,000IU of vitamin A daily starting on day 15 of their cycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of PMS symptoms.  After 2-6 months, all 30 pts reported a significant improvement in PMS symptoms.  Vitamin A supplementation was stopped once evidence of toxicity was demonstrated and all 30 pts were followed for one year after high dose vitamin A supplementation was stopped.  PMS symptoms did not reoccur in any of these 30 pts for upto one year after the vitamin A supplementation was stopped.Most Americans do not have a normal store of vitamin A in their liver.  These studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal store of vitamin A into the liver could eliminate PMS.  Of all the vitamins given for PMS(vitamin A, B6, and vitamin E), vitamin A has shown the best single effect.  This is probably because vitamin A is involved in steroid (estrogen/progesterone) metabolism in the liver.  Getting your liver full of vitamin A seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent the symptoms of PMS.  But vitamin A is toxic and you don't want to be trying to do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin A toxicity.VITAMIN B6: Experimental Double-blind Crossoverr Study, "Pyridoxine(vitamin B6) and the premenstrual syndrome: A randomized crossover trial"J.R. Coll. Gen. Pract. 39:364-68(1989).  32 women aged 18-49 with moderate to severe PMS randomly received 50mg B6 daily or placebo.  After 3 months the groups were switched and followed for another 3 months.  B6 had a significant effect on the emotional aspects of PMS(depression, irritability and tiredness).  Other symptoms of PMS were not significanttly affected by B6 supplementation.Experimental Double-blind Study, "The efects of vitamin B6 supplementation on premenstrual sysmptoms" Obstet. Gynecol 70(2):145-49(1987).  55 pts with moderate to severe PMS received 150mg B6 daily or placebo for 2 months.  Analysis of convergence showed that B6 significantly improved premenstrual symptoms related to the autonomic nervous system(dizziness and vomiting) as well as behavior changes(poor mental performance, decreased social interaction)  Anxiety, depression and water retention were not improved by B6 supplementation.Vitamin B6 is below the RDA for both American men and women.  Birth control pills and over 40 different drugs increase the B6 requirement in man.  Women on birth control pills should be supplemented with 10-15 mg of B6 per day.  The dose should be increased if symptoms of PMS appear.  Dr. David R. Rubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of NIMH was quoted in Clin. Psychiatry News, December, 1987 as stating that B6 should be considered the "first-line" drug for PMS(over progesterone) and if the patient does not respond, then other treatments should be tried.  Vitamin B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if consumed in doses of 500mg or more each day. VITAMIN E: Experimental Double-blind Study, "Efficacy of alpha-tocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome" J. Reprod. Med. 32(6):400-04(1987). 35 pts received 400IU vitamin E daily for 3 cycles or a placebo.  Vitamin E treated pts had 33% who reported a significant reduction in physical symptoms(weight gain and breast tenderness) while the placebo group had 14% who reported a significant reduction in physical symptoms. The vitamin E group reported that 38% had a significant reduction in anxiety versus 12% for the placebo group.  For depression, the vitamin E group had 27% with a significantdecrease in depression compared with 8% for the placebo group.Experimental Double-blind Study, "The effect of alpha-tocopherol on premenstrual symptomalogy: A double blind study" J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 2(2):115-122(1983). 75pts with benign breast disease and PMT randomly received vitamin E at 75IU, 150IU, or 300IU daily or placebo.  After 2 months of supplementation, 150IU of vitamin E or higher significantly improved PMT-A and PMT-C.  The 300IU dose was needed to significantly improve PMT-D.  No dose of vitamin E significantly improved PMT-H(other studies have shown that a higher vitamin E doses will relieve PMT-H symptoms).MAGNESIUM: Experimental Double-blind Study, "Magnesium prophylaxis of menstrual migraine: effects on itracellular magnesium" Headache 31:298-304(1991). 20 pts with perimenstrual headache received 360 mg daily of magnesium as magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a placebo.  Treatment was started on the 15th day of the cycle and continued until menstruation. After 2 months, the Pain Total Index was significantly lower in the magnesium group.  Magnesium treatment was also assocoiated with a significant reduction in the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire scores.  Pretreatment magnesium levels in  lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were significantly lower in this group of 20 pts compared to control women who did not suffer from PMS.  After treatment, magnesium levels in these cells was raised into the normal range.Experimental Double-blind Study, "Oral Magnesium successfully relieves premenstrual mood changes" Obstet. Gynecol 78(2):177-81(1991). 32pts aged 24-39 randomly received either magnesium carboxylic acid 360mg of Mg per day or a placebo from the 15th day of the cycle to the onset of the menstrual flow.  After 2 cycles, both groups received magnesium.  The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster pain was significantly reduced during the second cycle(month) for the magnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were switched to magnesium supplementation.  In addition, the total score on the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire was significantly decreased by magnesium supplementation.  The authors suggest that magnesium supplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes that occur during PMS.There are numerous observational studies that have been published in the medical literature which also suggest that PMS is primarily a disorder that arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature.  But since observational studies are considered by most physicians in Sci. Med. to be anecdotal in nature, I have not bothered to cite them.  There are also over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on multivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent PMS.  I've chosen the best specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out that PMS is primarily a nutritional disorder.  But doctors don't recognize nutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology(beri-beri, pellagra, scruvy, etc.).  PMS is probably the best reason why every doctor being trained in the U.S. should get a good course on human nutrition.  PMS is really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritional disorders.  It's time that medicine woke up and smelled the roses.Here's some studies which show the importance in multivitamin/mineral supplementation and/or diet change in preventing PMS.Experimental Study, "Effect of a nutritional programme on premenstrual syndrome: a retrospective analysis", Complement. Med. Res.5(1):8-11(1991).  200pts were given dietary instructions and supplemented with Optivite(R) plus additional vitamin C, vitamin E, magnesium, zinc and primrose oil.  The dietary instructions were to take the supplements and switch to a low fat, complex carbohydrate diet.  On a retrospective analysis, 96.5% of the 200pts reported an improvement in their PMS symptoms with 30% of the sample stating that they no longer suffered from PMS. Experimental Double-blind Study, "Role of Nutrition in managing premenstrual tension syndromes", J Reprod. Med. 32(6):405-22(1987).  A low fat, high complex carbohydrate diet along with Optivite supplementation significantly decreased PMS scores compared with diet change and placebo.  After 6 months on the experimental program, the vitamin/mineral supplementated group had significantly decreased estradiol and increased progesterone in serum during the midlutel phase of their cycle.Experimental Double-blind Study, "Clinical and biochemical effects of nutritional supplementation on the premenstrual syndrome", J. Reprod. Med. 32(6):435-41(1987). 119pts randomly given Optivite(12 tablets per day) or a placebo.  The treated groups showed a significant decrease in PMS symptoms compared to the placebo.  Another group of 104pts got Optivite(4 tablets per day) or placebo.  For this second group of patients, no significant effect of supplementation on PMS symptoms was observed.Martin Banschbach, Ph.D.Professor of Biochemistry and ChairmanDepartment of Biochemistry and MicrobiologyOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine1111 W. 17th St.Tulsa, Ok 74107"Without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there is no learning, without learning, there is only ignorance"

I'm thinking   that education suppliers for schools might have a appartus for   sale, but I don't know any of the companies. Any info is greatly   appreciated.   In case you don't know, Krillean Photography, to the best of my   knowledge, involves taking pictures of an (most of the time) organic   object between charged plates. The picture will show energy patterns   or spikes around the object photographed, and depending on what type   of object it is, the spikes or energy patterns will vary. One might   extrapolate here and say that this proves that every object within   the universe (as we know it) has its own energy signature.There have been a number of scientific papers (in peer-reviewed journals)published about Kirlian photography in the early 1970s.  Sorry I can't bemore specific but it is a long time since I read them.  They would describewhat is needed and how to set up the apparatus.  These papers demonstrate that the auras obtained by Kirlian photography canbe completely explained by the effect of the electric currents used on themoisture in the object being photographed.  It has nothing to do with the"energy signature" of organic objects.I did a science project on Kirlian photography when I was in high school.I was able to obtain wonderful auras from rocks and pebbles and the like byfirst dunking them in water.Barbara----bls101@syseng.anu.edu.au"I generally avoid temptation unless I can't resist it."                 - Mae West

Gordon Rubenfeld did a Medline search and also sent me the same reference through e-mail.  Since commercial yogurt does not always have a good Lactobacillus a. or bulgaricus culture, a negative finding would not have been too informative.This is often the reason why Lactobacillus acidophilus tablets are recommended rather than yogurt.I guess the next question is why would this introduction of "good" bacteria back into the gut decrease the incidence of vaginal candida blooms if the anus was not serving as a candida reservoir(a fact that Gordon R. vehementydenys)?  I see two possible theories.  One, the L. acidophilus, which is a facultatively anaerobic bacterium, could make it through the gut and colonize the rectal area to overgrow the candida.  This would not explain the reoccurance of candida blooms in the vagina after the yogurt ingestion was stopped though.  The other is that the additional bacteria in the intestinal tract remove most of the glucose from the feces and candida looses it's major food source.Getting Lactobacillus acidophilus to colonize the vaginal tract(where it is normally found) would have a much better effect on the recurrance of vaginal yeast blooms though.  An acetic acid, Lactobacillus acidophilus douche has been used to get this effect but I've not seen any such treatment reported in the medical literature.  This would be an example of physicians conducting their own clinical trials to try to come up with treatments that help their patients.  When this is done in private practice, the results are rarely, if ever published.  It was the hallmark of medicine until the modern age emerged with clinical trials.  It really raises a big question.  Does the medical profession cast out the adventerous few who try new treatments to help patients or does it look the other way.This particular issue is really a very simple one since no real dangerous therapy is involved(even the anti-fungals are not all that dangerous).  But there are some areas(like EDTA chelation therapy), where the fire is pretty hot and somebody could get burned.  It's really tough.  Do I follow only well established protocols and then give up if they don't work that well or do it try something that looks like it will work but hasn't been proven to work yet?My stand is to consider other treatment possibilities, especially if they involve little or no risk to the patient.  Getting good bacteria back into the gut after antibiotic treatment is one treatment possibility.  The other is getting L. acidophilus into the vaginal tract of a woman who is having a problem with recurring yeast infections.Marty B.

Researchers have found that eating a cup of yogurt a day drastically    reduces a woman's chances of getting vaginal candida, a yeast infection.  For the year-long study, researchers at Long Island Jewish Medical    Center in New Hyde Park, New York, recruited 13 women who suffered from chronic yeast infections. For the first 6 months, the women each day ate8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. For the second 6 months, the women did not eat yogurt. The researchers examined the    women each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection were significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.     The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm.  It is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The   researchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some    brands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus         thermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used  in commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a         protective effect against Candida albicans, however. Women who want to  try yogurt as a preventive measure should choose a brand that lists     acidophilus in its contents.                                            --- end ---                                            ===================================InfoTrac - Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92  THE MATERIAL CONTAINED IN Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92 IS PROVIDED  ONLY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS  MEDICAL ADVICE OR INSTRUCTION.

All I can say is that I will not consume it.  Aspartame is the methyl ester of a dipeptide, so a product of itshydrolysis is going to be methanol, which can then be oxidized toformaldehyde.  The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion ofaspartame-containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise,since you're forming equally minute amounts of methanol from othercomponents of food all the time.  In studies involving administrationof high doses of the additive, blood methanol levels were undetectable.Methanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings,say 5ml and above.  This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehydeand formic acid, two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levelscan damage tissues like the retina and kidney, because at such high dosesthe body's detoxification system is overwhelmed.  Interestingly, onetreatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk onethyl alcohol--vodka or an equivalent.  That's because ethanol ismetabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver.If the methanol stays as methanol and isn't metabolized to formaldehyde,it is actually relatively non-toxic.-- Steve Dyerdyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer

This disease is universally and usually rapidly fatal.  After diagnosis in June 1992, the tumor was growing rapidly despite radiation and chemotherapy.  The forum member checked extensively on Dr. Burzynki's track record for this disease.  He spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years from glioblastoma following this treatment and to an NCI oncologist who had audited other such case histories and found them valid and impressive.  After the forum member's father began Dr. Burzynski's treatment in September, all subsequent scans performed under the auspices of his oncologist in Chicago have shown no tumor growth with possible signs of shrinkage or necrosis.The patient's oncologist, although telling him he would probably not live past December 1992, was vehemently opposed to his trying Dr. Burzynski's treatment.  Since the tumor stopped its rapid growth under Dr. Burzynski's treatment, she's since changed her attitude toward continuing these treatments, saying "if it ain't broke, don't fix it."Dr. Burzynski is an M.D., Ph.D. with a research background who found a protein that is at very low serum levels in cancer patients, synthesized it, and administers it to patients with certain cancer types.  There is little understanding of the actual mechanism of activity./*********************************************************************//*                      --- David E.

Is this just to get rid of the resultant migraine orwhatever, or does it actually suppress allergic reactions? (i.e. like anantihistamine does?)  As far as doctors over here are concerned, if you slip upand eat something you're allergic to (even if they won't test you to tell youwhat to avoid) then tough; if a _cheap_ medicine will alleviate your symptoms,then fine, otherwise you just suffer.  One doctor did prescribe me imigran (coststhe NHS #48 for 6 tablets) after having to rehydrate me because I'd been throwingup for four solid days and couldn't even drink water - but I got taken off itagain when I moved and had to change doctors.  Reasoning: they did not know whatthe side-effects were because it was new.  OK, fine - but it has passed thesafety tests to get on the prescription list, and anyway I was prepared to takethe risk to have quality of life now.  The only alternatives I have is to get itprescribed privately, which I cannot afford, or to pay a private allergyspecialist to test me and tell me what to avoid.  I am fairly certain I amallergic to more than one chemical additive, as a lot of things I can't eat havenothing in common except things I know are safe, so testing myself isn't reallyan option; there are too many permutations.> I'm not saying I NEVER consume ANYTHING with MSG.

Unions Point To Deadly Workplaces; AFSCME, Other UnionsCommemorate Workers Memorial Day To: National Desk, Labor Writer Contact: Janet Rivera of the American Federation of State, Countyand Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, 202-429-1130   WASHINGTON, April 23 -- The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and other unionsof the AFL-CIO on Wednesday, April 28, will commemorate the fifthannual Workers Memorial Day -- a day to pay homage to the 6million workers who are killed, injured, or diseased on the job.   This year, AFSCME will focus its Workers Memorial Day efforts anthe dangerous environment in which corrections officers must work.Earlier this month, an AFSCME corrections officer, RobertVallandingham, was killed by inmates who overtook the correctionsfacility in Lucasville, Ohio.   The law and order agenda of the 1980s has resulted in a steadyincrease in the prison population for the past five years.  OnJn. 1, 1992, the prison population was 709,587. Projectionsshow a continued increase in the number of inmates, with anexpected prison population of 811,253 in 1994.   The conditions which this burgeoning prison population hascreated for corrections officers is partially reflected in thenumber of assaults by inmates against staff.  Assaults againststaff increased dramatically between 1987 and 1989, and remainhigh.  In 1987, there were 808 assaults by inmates against staff,compared to 9,961 such assaults in 1991.   The increased number of inmates has brought on the dangerouscombination of overcrowding and understaffing.  For example in Ohioofficer-to-inmate ratio is 1 to 8.4 -- the second worst ratio inthe nation. The national average is 1 to 5.3.  Other health andsafety issues facing corrections officers include AIDS, HepatitisB, tuberculosis, stress, and chemical hazards.   AFSCME has more than 50,000 members who work in the nation'sfederal, state and local correctional facilities.   Correction officers are not alone in performing their jobs underlife-threatening conditions.  Every year, 10,000 American workersdie from job-related injuries, and tens of thousands more die fromoccupational disease.  Public employees do some of the nation'smost dangerous jobs. Perilous occupations include:   -- Highway Workers - Highway workers are often injured and      frequently killed by moving traffic because work zones are      not barricaded or don't have proper lighting.   -- Health Care Workers - Hospitals have the highest number of      job-related injuries and illnesses of any private sector      employer and nursing homes ranked fifth.  There were more      than 325,000 job-related illnesses and injuries in private      sector hospitals in 1991, up almost 10 percent over the      previous year.  It is generally believed that health care      workers employed at public sector hospitals and nursing homes      have a significantly higher rate of injuries and illnesses      than do their private sector counterparts.  Health and safety      issues facing health care workers include exposure to      tuberculosis and the HIV virus, back injuries, and high      levels of stress.   -- Social Workers - Social workers who work in mental health      institutions are often the victims of assaults and,      sometimes, fatal attacks.  For instance, last October, a man      carrying a semiautomatic handgun walked into the Schuyler      County Social Services Building in Watkins Glenn, N.Y.      and fatally shot social services workers, before turning the      gun on himself.  There are two basic problems.  First is a      growing lack of support services for people who don't have      the help they need.  Because workers are overworked, some      clients are not given the adequate amount of counselling.      Such conditions may cause clients to become more frustrated.      The "quality" of the clients is also becoming more violent,      as more are moved out of the institutions.   Nearly 2 million workers have been killed by workplace hazardssince OSHA was passed.  Moreover, as AFSCME President Gerald W.McEntee explains, OSHA does not provide workplace safetyprotections for public employees.   "More than 1,600 public employees are killed each year on thejob, yet 27 states still provide no federally-approved OSHAcoverage for public employees," said McEntee.  "This, despite thefact that public employees -- highway workers, health care workers,corrections officers, to name but a few -- do some of the mostdangerous work in our society.  This year we are fighting forpassage of OSHA reform legislation to give all workers greaterrights and protections, and finally guarantee all public employeessafe workplaces.  We need the public support to be successful."   Government workers suffer 25 percent more injuries than privatesector workers, and these injuries are almost 75 percent moresevere.   Public employees were exempted from OSHA when the law was passedin 1970 and today, public employees in more than half the stateshave no OSHA coverage. -30---Canada Remote Systems - Toronto, Ontario416-629-7000/629-7044

When I gotout of the hospital I read up on it a bit, and came across severalstudies investigating the role of EPA (an essentially FA) in reducinginflammation. The evidence was mixed. [Many of these studies arediscussed in "Inflammatory Bowel Disease," MacDermott, Stenson. 1992.]But if I recall correctly, there were some methodological bones to bepicked with the studies (both the ones w/pos. and w/neg. results). Inthe studies patients were given EPA (a few grams/day for most of thestudies), but, if I recall correctly, there was no restriction of the_other_ FAs that the patients could consume. From the informedlayperson's perspective, this seems mistaken. If lots of n-6 FAs areconsumed along with the EPA, then the ratio of "bad" prostanoidproducts to "good" prostanoid products could still be fairly "bad."Isn't this ratio the issue?What's the view of the gastro. community on EPA these days? EPAsupplements, along with a fairly severe restriction of other FAsappear to have helped me significantly (though it could just be thelow absolute amount of fat I eat -- 8-10% calories).-Brian <bmdelane@midway.uchicago.edu>

Med. Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production(toxic, kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as well because of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I got into Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation.  I'm going to state it again here.But the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6 supplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys).Vitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 grams per day).1. Review Article "Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney    stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C" Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev.   5(3):110-129(1985).But glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For both glycine and vitamin C, one of the best ways to drastically reduce this production is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine, but to increase your intake of vitamin B6.2. "Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in     patients with kidney stones" Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988)    200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary     excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program.3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria" Clin. Sci. 38   :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day    showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels.For gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is required for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for oxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C, the effect is quite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism.  The pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40% of the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variable and the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto 6 grams per day, not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic acid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day), more of the extra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In a very early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 85:190-92(1954), intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day increased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg per day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted was increased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram dose and 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion before supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average before supplementation.B6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  There are probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we don't know about yet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must have an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could then explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C challenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing your intake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you take vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficient in B6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate kidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets absorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:309-15,1980).  If 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increase in urinary oxalate excretion.Here are the high oxalate foods:1. Beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea.   Contain at least 25mg/100grams2. Beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale,    peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe.   Contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams.If the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lot of latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being absorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6, you shouldn't have to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for males and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake).B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more per day for an extended peroid(weeks to months).  The USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day for males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled with this low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6 requirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that either block B6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of B6, or promote B6 excretion in the urine.  Common ones are: birth control pills, alcohol,isoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids.  I tell my students to supplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that increase the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients taking birth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the other drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your dietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone formation should be given B6 supplements.One other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your Ca/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is calcium-oxalate.4. "The magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of patients with calcium oxalate calculi"Invest. Urol 10:147(1972)5. "Effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the crystallization of calcium in urine: changes producted by food-magnesium interaction"J. Urol. 143(2):248-51(1990).6.Review Article, "Magnesium in the physiopathology and treatment of renal calcium stones" J. Presse Med. 161(1):25-27(1987).There are actually about three times as many articles published in the medical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone formation than there are for B6.  I thought that I was being pretty safe in stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier post in this news group but good old John A. in Mass. jumped all over me. I guess that he doesn't read the medical literature.  Oh well, since kidney stones can be a real pain and a lot of people suffer from them, I thought I'd tell you how you can avoid the pain and stay out of the doctor's office.Martin Banschbach, Ph.D.Professor of Biochemistry and ChairmanDepartment of Biochemistry and MicrobiologyOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine1111 W. 17th StreetTulsa, Ok. 74107"Without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there is no learning, without learning, there is only ignorance".

It did a good job of reducing cholesterol (295down to around 214), as well as LDL and triglycerides.  Then, I gotpneumonia, and for some reason, the Lopid stopped working very well;cholesterol and triglycerides soared.  The levels might have stabilizedover time, but a new doctor had me quit, wait a month, then switchto Mevicore.  On Mevicore, my total cholesterol was down to 207,  LDL was 108, and HDL was 35; but the trig's were stillvery high, around 318, and my liver tests came back slightly abnormal, SGOT = 83 (N = 1-35),  GGTP(?hard to read copy) = 42 (N = 0 - 35).He said the liver numbers were not offbase enough to cause himconcern, and the triglycerides are not as important as the cholesterolfigures.  He had me stop the Mevicore to allow the liver to heal ("Justto be extra cautious, though I'm sure it's not a problem."),and wants me to go back on it after that.  I suggested maybe Lopid mightbe the better choice, and he said that he wouldn't object if that's whatI want to do.  But Lopid has one particular side effect I'm not fond of.Should the above liver and trig figures be feared?  What happens tofolks with high trig levels?  Is my liver in danger with the aboveresults?  Would I be better off on Lopid, despite its inconvenient side effect, or, perhaps, some other drug?  (Niacin affected my liver, too).

Being my anxiety level is peaking and youfolks have no clue who I am I may as well post the specifics and see whatyou people think regarding my previous post.To recap i applied to 20 schools total, 16 of which were MD and 4 DO.as it stands now i have had 13 rejects, 4 interviews( 2 MD and 2 DO), theresults of which are 2 waiting lists (1 MD and one DO)3 schools i heard nothing from at all.I have contacted all institutions other than the rejects and they have noinfo whatsoever to tell me.I have taken a good mix to apply to.. 2-3 top schools a bunch of middlesand a few "safety"  (funny that most of my safety schools were the firstto reject me)my index is at like a 3.5 mcats were R7 P9 B10 WQ and R7 P9 B11 WRI couldnt get the damn reading score up... i never stuff like arthistory, politics etc Ive done medical research at the undergrad level, done clinical lab workfor years now, but unfortunately i have no patient contact experience.I cant think of what else i left out... but thats the summary. Whatpercent of people are usually called from the waiting lists on an average?I felt that my interviews went quite well yet i dont have a firmacceptance in my hand... anyone have any suggestions as to calm themailbox anxiety?  If you premeds out there or med students have any questions or commentsfor me feel free to send them down...

Up to six capsulesa day was recommended, if I remember correctly.  It can also be prepared as a tea.Good luck,John

It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10.     It  was  commissioned by some whiny consumers  group  called Families USA.      The  poll tells us that the majority of  Americans  believe that doctors make too much money.     The  pollsters  also asked what a fair income would  be  for physicians.  Those polled said, oh, about $80,000 a year would be OK.     How generous.  How sporting.  How stupid.     Why is this poll stupid?   Because it is based on resentment and envy, two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign and are still simmering.     You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that earns $100,000-plus and get the same results.  Since the majority of Americans don't make those bucks,  they assume that those  who do are stealing it from them.     Maybe  the Berlin Wall came down,  but don't  kid  yourself.  Karl Marx lives.     It's also stupid because it didn't ask key  questions,  such as:  Do  you  know how much education and training  it  takes  to become a physician?     If those polled said no,  they didn't know, then they should have  been disqualified.   If they gave the wrong  answers,  they should have been dropped.   What good are their views on how much a doctor should earn if they don't know what it takes to become a doctor?     Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way:  "How much  should  a person earn if he or she must (a)  get  excellent grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in  order to (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years  taking courses heavy in math, physics, chemistry, and other lab work and maintain a 3.5 average or better,  and (c) spend four more  years of  grinding study in medical school,  with the third and  fourth years in clinical training,  working 80 to 100 hours a week,  and (d) spend another year as a low-pay,  hard-work intern,  and  (e) put  in  another  three to 10 years  of  post-graduate  training, depending  on  your specialty and (f) maybe wind up  $100,000  in debt  after  medical school and (g) then work an  average  of  60 hours  a week,  with many family doctors putting in 70  hours  or more until they retire or fall over?"     As  you have probably guessed by now,  I  have  considerably more  respect for doctors than does the law firm of  Clinton  and Clinton,  and all the lawyers and insurance executives they  have called together to remake America's health care.     Based  on what doctors contribute to society,  they are  far more useful than the power-happy,  ego-tripping, program-spewing, social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is to health what Clinton's first budget is to frugality.     But propaganda works.   And,  as the stupid poll  indicates, many Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are  the major cause of high medical costs.     Of  course doctors are well-compensated.   They  should  be.  Americans now live longer than ever.   But who is responsible for our longevity--lawyers,  Congress, or the guy flipping burgers in a McDonald's?     And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having  become a  nation  of  self-indulgent,   lard-butted,   TV-gaping   couch cabbages.     Ah,  that  is not something you heard President  Clinton  or Super  Spouse  talk  about during the  campaign  or  since.   But instead of trying to turn the medical profession into a  villain, they might have been more honest if they had said:     "Let  us  talk  about medical care and one  of  the  biggest problems we have.   That problem is you, my fellow American. Yes, you,  eating  too much and eating the wrong foods;  many  of  you guzzling  too  much hooch;  still puffing away at $2.50  a  pack; getting  your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to  the microwave to the couch; doing dope and bringing crack babies into the  world;  filling  the big city emergency rooms  with  gunshot victims;  engaging  in unsafe sex and catching a  deadly  disease while blaming the world for not finding an instant cure.     "You  and  your habits,  not the  doctors,  are  the  single biggest  health  problem in this country.   If  anything,  it  is amazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do.     "In fact,  I don't understand how they can stand looking  at your blubbery bods all day.     "So as your president,  I call upon you to stop whining  and start living cleanly.   Now I must go get myself a triple cheesy-greasy with double fries.  Do as I say, not as I do."     But  for those who truly believe that doctors are  overpaid, there is another solution: Don't use them.     That's right.   You don't feel well?   Then try one of those spine poppers,  needle twirlers, or have Rev. Bubba lay his hands upon your head and declare you fit.     Or  there is the do-it-yourself approach.   You  have  chest pains?   Then sit in front of a mirror,  make a slit here, a slit there, and pop in a couple of valves.     You're  going to have a kid?   Why throw your money at  that overpaid  sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger  house than  you  will  ever  have  (while  paying  more  in  taxes  and malpractice insurance than you will ever earn)?     Just have the kid the old-fashioned way.   Squat and do  it.  And if it survives,  you can go to the library and find a book on how to give it its shots.     By  the  way,  has  anyone  ever done a  poll  on  how  much pollsters should earn?Royko  is  a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for  Tribune  Media Services.____________________________________________________________________________--**********************************************Vinay J.

Our guest speaker will be Dr. Lewis Teperman.  Dr. Teperman trained in Pittsburgh under Dr. Starzl and is now the Assistant Director of the Liver Transplant Program at New York University Medical Center.  Dr. Teperman will discuss current trends in transplantation and treatment and will answer questions.  He is a long time friend of TRIO, surgeon to many of our members, and always a gracious and delightful guest.   It is sure to be a very informative, interesting and engaging evening.  Our hospitality committee,  Bette and Vito Suglia and Jim Spence will be well prepared, and at last the weather should be cooperative. We hope to see a very large gathering to welcome Dr. Teperman.           WEDNESDAY    APRIL 14  K of C   UNIONDALELAST MEETINGIt has been noted here before that the Long Island Chapter of TRIO has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather, being able to forecast rain, sleet and snow fully a month in advance.  No TV weatherman can match us. This time we not only scored again, but we were also able to disable the Long Island Railroad, making travel REALLY difficult.  None the less, many braved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good conversation.  Our scheduled speaker, Mrs. Elizabeth Linnehan, a professional nutritionist, had a family emergency and was not able to attend.  She hope she will be with us in the fall to discuss diet and medications.  However,  Ms. Jennifer Friedman, an image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient was kind enough to step in on very short notice.  Ms. Friedman gave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup, (even a bit for men) to help us look well and healthy and to minimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine and drugs we take.  We are most grateful to Jennifer and thank her for an entertaining evening.ANNUAL MEETINGIn addition to welcoming Dr. Teperman, the April meeting is also the Annual meeting of the Chapter.  This is the official notice of the meeting as required by our By-Laws. The main purpose of the meeting is to review the past year, solicit member views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs, and to elect members of the Board of Directors for the coming two year term.  The nominating committee has prepared the following slate for the Board.         Anne (Liver Recipient) and Don Treffeisen         Robert (Heart Recipient) and Eulene Smith         Vito (Kidney Recipient) and Bette Suglia         Kay Grenzig (Liver Recipient)         Jan Schichtel (Kidney Recipient)         Larry Juliano (Kidney Recipient)         David Bekofsky (Director Public Education LITP)Those remaining on the Board for another year are:         Robert Carroll (Liver, Kidney & Pancreas Recipient)         Jerry (Kidney Recipient) and Jeanne Eichhorn         Ron (Kidney Donor) and Marie Healy         Peter Smith (Bone Marrow Recipient)         Patricia Ann Yankus (Kidney and Pancreas Recipient)         Walter Ruzak (Kidney Recipient)This may seem to be a big Board, but many hands make light work and with our various medical uncertainties, it is good to have backups for all the jobs on the Board.  Therefore, in addition to the slate being presented for voting, nominations will also be accepted from the floor.  There is no set number of Board members and there is plenty of work. In addition,  brief treasurer's and membership reports will be given and the floor will be open for any new business, suggestions, or comments anyone would like to bring up.We will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the majority of the time with Dr. Teperman.FUTURE MEETINGSRemember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year.       May  12      Dr. Peter Shaprio, Chief of Psychiatry                  Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center     June  9      Dr. Felix Rappaport, Director of the Stony                   Brook Kidney Transplant Program. Plan on being with us the second Wednesday of each month.NOTDAWThe week of April 18-24 is National Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Week. NOTDAW. While we are planning news releases, speaking engagements and meetings with Supervisors Gullata and Gaffney, we have decided not to have our softball game   because of two year's experience with miserable weather. We all can help spread the word on donor awareness, however. We have found it effective to ask your pastor, or rabbi to publish a letter or announcement in the parish bulletin, allow you to address the congregation, or include mention of the gift of life in his sermon.  Attached to this Newsletter is a sample letter and fact sheet you can use.   Thank you.DR. STARZL TO BE HONORED The Long Island Chapter of the American Liver Foundation will hold its annual Auction and Dinner Dance on May 7th at the Fountainbleu  on Jericho Turnpike in Jericho.  Dr. Thomas Starzl will be the honored guest.  Tickets are $50 person and are going fast.  If you'd like to meet Dr. Starzl,  call Anne Treffeisen at (516) 421-3258 for details.MEMBERSHIP NEWS Congratulations to Al Reese.  Al received his heart transplant in Pittsburgh after waiting 3 1/2 years.  He is home and doing well after only 12 days in hospital.Arthur Michaels, liver recipient, is planning to run the Boston Marathon in April. What fantastic proof that transplantation works!  We hope the national press notices.      Bob McCormack, after a persistent bout with infection, had his transplanted kidney removed.  He is home now, back on dialysis and feeling better.  Nicole Healy, kidney recipient and daughter of Ron and Marie, spent the past several weeks in hospital in Miami with problems encountered on vacation.  Marie has been with her in Florida.  They are back in New York where Nicole's treatment will continue.  We wish Nicole a speedy recovery. Kay Grenzig, liver recipient, is mending now after a bad fall that resulted in a broken arm and a broken leg. Kay is a candidate for the Board so we need her well soon.

In this post on depression, I'm laying it all out.  I'll continue to post here because I think that I have some knowledge that could be useful.  Once you have read this post, you should know where I'm coming from when I post again in the future.In article <123552@netnews.upenn.edu>, lchaplyn@mail.sas.upenn.edu (Lida Chaplynsky) writes:> > A family member of mine is suffering from a severe depression brought on> by menopause as well as a mental break down.

Both my wife and I suffered from bouts of depression.  Her's was brought on by breast cancer and mine was a rebound stress reaction to her modified radical mastectomy and chemotherapy.  Lida, I used my knowledge of nutrition to get her through her six months of chemotherapy(with the approval of her oncologist).  When severe depression set in a few months after the chemo stopped, I tried to use supplements to bring her out of it.  I had "cured" her PMS using supplements and I really thought that I knew enough about the role of diet in depression to take care of her depression as well.  It didn't work and she was put on Prozac by her oncologist.  Two Winters ago(three years after by wife's breast cancer) I got hit with severe depression(pretty typical and one reason why many marriages break up after breast cancer or another stressor).  I tried to take care of it for several months with supplementation.  Didn't work.  My internist ended up putting me on Prozac. I was going to give you a list of several studies that have been done using B6, niacin, folate and B12 to "cure" depression.  I'm not going to do that because all you would be doing is flying blind like I was.Lida, I do believe that depression can have a dietary component.  But the problem is that you need to know exactly what the problem is and then use an approach which will "fix" the problem.  For chemotherapy, I knew exactly what drugs were going to be used and exactly what nutrients would be affected.  Same thing for PMS.  I was flying blind for both of these stressors but the literature that I used to devise a treatment program was pretty good.  Depression is just too complicated.  What you really need is a nutritional scan.  This is not a diet analysis but an analysis of your bodies nutrient reserves.  For every vitamin and mineral(except vitamin C), you have a reserve.  The RDA is not designed to give you enough of any nutrient to keep these reserves full, it is only designed to keep them from being emptied which would cause clinical pathology.  Stress will increase your need for many vitamins and minerals.  This is when your reserves become very important.Lida, without your permission, I'm going to use your post as a conduit to try to explain to the readers in this group and Sci. Med. where I'm coming from.  I have taught a course on human nutrition in one of the Osteopathic Medical schools for ten years now.  I've written my own textbook because none was available.  What I teach is not a rehash of biochemistry.  I preach nutrient reserves(yes my lectures in this course are referred to by my students as sermons).  Here is what I cover:Indroduction and Carbohydrates LipidsProteins IProteins IIEnergy BalanceEvaluation of NutritionalStatus I, A Clinical PerspectiveEvaluation of Nutritional Status II,            Evaluation of NutritionalA Biochemical PerspectiveStatus III, Homework Assignment Using the Nutritionist IV Diet and Fitness Analysis Software programWeight ControlFood Fads and FactsAge-Related Change in Nutrient RequirementsFood Additives, Contaminants and CancerDrug-Nutrient InteractionsMineral and Water BalanceSodium, Potassium and ChlorideCalcium, Magnesium and PhosphorusIronZinc and CopperIodine and FluorideOther Trace MineralsVitamin AVitamin EVitamins D and KVitamin CThiamin and NiacinRiboflavin and PyridoxinePantothenic and Folic acidsBiotin and B12Other Nutrient FactorsEnteral NutritionParenteral NutritionEvery three years I spend my entire Summer reviewing the Medical literature to find material that I can use in my nutrition textbook.  I last did this in the Summer of 1991.  I read everything that I can find and then sit down and rewrite my lecture handouts which are bound in three separate books that have 217, 237 and 122 pages.  Opposite each page of written text(which I write myself) I've pulled figures, tables and graphs from various copyrighted sources.  Since this material is only being used for educational purposes, I can get around the copyright laws (so far).  I can not send this material out to newsgroup readers(as I've been asked to do).I am now in the process of trying to get a grant to setup a nutrition assessment lab.  This is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that I need to make my education program complete.  This lab will let me measure the nutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known to be required in humans.  The Mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab to design supplement programs for their cancer patients.  Cancer Treatment Centers of America, which is a private for-profit organization with hospitals in Illinois and Oklahoma(Tulsa) also operates a nutritional assessment clinical lab.  I also believe that the Pritikin Clinic in California has a similiar lab setup.For physicians reading this post, I would suggest that you get the new Clinical Nutrition Textbook that has just been published(Feb) by Mosby.  I have been using Alpers Manual of Nutritional Therapeutics(a Little Brown series book) as a supplemental text for my course but Alpers is geared more to residency training.  Two M.D's have written this new Clinical Nutritiontextbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and it does a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess a patient's nutritional status.  Let me quote a few sentences from the Preface of this new text:"So-called nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists, hematologists, or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledge of nutrition as it related to their field of practice."  "Unfortunately, about two thirds of the medical schools in the United States require no formal instruction in nutrition.""But times and medical practice have changed.  More than half of the leading causes of death in this country are nutrition related.""... this monograph should accomplish the following two objectives: (1) it should complement your medical training by emphasizing the relevance of nutrition to your medical practice; and (2) it should heighten your awareness of nutrition as a medical speciality that is vitally important for both disease prevention and the treatment of diseases of essentially every organ system."Roland L. Weinsier, MD, DrPH Lida, my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to find a physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and minerals(yes even magnesium may play a role in depression) play in depression and who could get a nutritional profile run.  Menopause is often a time when women suffer depression.  There are a lot of hormonal changes that are occuring but they are not the same ones that occur during PMS.  A nutritionist may also be able to help.  Not too long ago a poster mentioned that his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a red cell glutathionine peroxidase test(the specific test for the selenium reserve).  Most clinical labs will not run this test and I advised him to try to make sure that the lab that did the test was certified.  There are also a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineral analysis but these labs are not regulated.  Checks of these labs using certified standards, and also those doing water lead analysis, showed some pretty shoddy testing was going on.  If you or anyone else finds someone who will run these speciality nutrition tests, make sure that they are using a lab that has been certified under CLIA(the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act).  A diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shown to correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food logging and software analysis(Nutritionist IV and other software programs).  But there are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do not show a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve status.Until we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in the U.S. and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritional profile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that uses diet changes and supplementation, anti-depressants will probably continue to be the best approach to depression.Martin Banschbach, Ph.D.Professor of Biochemistry and ChairmanDepartment of Biochemistry and MicrobiologyOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine"Without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there is no learning, without learning, there is only ignorance."

Very little acne as a teenager. Ididn't have any luck with clearasil. Even though my skin gets oily itreally only gets miserable pimples when it's dry. Frequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help. Getting the scalpthing under control might help (that could be as simple as submerging underthe bathwater till it's softened and washing it out). Taking a one a dayvitamin/mineral might help. I've heard iodine causes trouble and that it  is used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might bewhere the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from. I notice grease on my face, not immediately removed will cause acne (even from eatingmeat).Keeping hair rinse, mousse, dip, and spray off the face will help. Warmwater bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores willhelp prevent blackheads. Body oil is hydrophilic, loves water and itsoftens and washes off when it has a chance. That's why hair goes limp withoilyness. Becoming convinced that the best thing to do witha whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery. Anyprying of black or whiteheads can cause infections, the red spots ofpimples. Usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there won'tbe an infection afterwards.Tell him that it's normal to have some pimples but the cosmetic industrymakes it's money off of selling people on the idea that they are anincredible defect to be hidden at any cost (even that of causing more pimples). -Jackie-

Some people are concerned about the chemicals that the  body produces when it degrades nutrasweet.  It is thought to form formaldehyde and known tofor methanol in the degredation pathway that the body uses to eliminate substances.  The real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehydeproduced are high enough to cause significant damage, as both are toxic toliving cells.  All I can say is that I will not consume it.  Phenylalanine isnothing for you to worry about.  It is an amino acid, and everyone uses smallquantities of it for protein synthesis in the body.  Some people have a diseaseknown as phenylketoneurea, and they are missing the enzyme necessary to degrade this compound and eliminate it from the body.  For them, it will accumulate in the body, and in high levels this is toxic to growing nervecells.  Therefore, it is Only a major problem in young children (until aroundage 10 or so) or women who are pregnant and have this disorder.  It used tobe a leading cause of brain damage in infants, but now it can be easily detected at birth, and then one must simply avoid comsumption of phenylalanineas a child, or when pregnant.  -heather

I must assumethat my wife's answer is closer to the truth than I hoped it was.She believes that MSG is added to food to cause people to eat more of itand not quit when they shoud be sated.  To put it a different way, she believes that for some people MSG causes them to act toward food like an addict.  (Eat all the chips, chow down on several packages of noodle soup .... you get theidea! }  IF she is right, then the moral and ethical standards of the food, chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed!!!  Can MSGbe considered a conditioning substance (not addictive but sort of habitforming) ?This brings up a side question of mine.   I have noticed that cats (mychildren's and my parent's) seem to fixate on a particular brand of petfood. The cat will eat any product within one brand and not any otherbrand.  I have wondered if this is not a case of preference, but, somesort of chemical training or addiction. My questions, for the net, are:Does the FDA regulate the contents of pet food?  Is it allowed for petfood to contain addictive or conditioning substances?  Is MSG put in pet food?-----------------------------------I speak for myself and not Motorola----------------------------------- -- Walter Lundby

Generally, even if accidently inoculated, the normalimmune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant involved with acupuncture needle insertion. Most acupuncturists use disposable needles...use once and throw away. They      do this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of diseases via this route...so it's good business to advertise "disposable needlesused here." These needles tend to be of a lower quality however, being poorly manufactured and too "sharp" in my opinion. They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles.                                                                        If I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint, that patient will get their own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments.      The risk here for hepatitis, HIV, etc. transmission is that I could mistakenly use an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong              patient...but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates this risk. Better quality needles tend to "slide" past vessels and            nerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags..and hematomas...so I use them.                        Acupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses...but they are all solid when compared to their injection-style cousins. In China, herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into meridian points purported to have TCM physiologic effects and so require the same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine. This means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue, the diameter of the needle bore, will be injected into the body as it would  be in a typical "shot." when the skin is puntured. On the other hand when the solid acupuncture needle is inserted, the skin tends to "squeeze" the needle from the tip to the level of insertion such that any 'cooties' that haven't been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion, tend to remain on the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior. Of course in TCM...the body's exterior is protected by the Wei (Protective) Qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatory and immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture site.While I'm fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease transmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion, I would like to know for what complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know  if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful.

She said even common ear infections frequently seen inchildren are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment."Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious  diseaseswould soon be eliminated as a public health problem, infectious diseasesremain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illnessand death in the United States," the CDC said.It  cited  the  emergence since the 1970s of a "myriad" of newlyidentified pathogens and syndromes, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, adeadly bacterial infection; the hepatitis C virus; HIV, the virus thatcauses AIDS; Legionnaires disease; Lyme disease; and toxic shock syndrome."The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control,such as cholera, malaria and tuberculosis, have increased in many areas,"the CDC said.  It said efforts at control and prevention have beenundermined by drug resistance.=====*=====SOURCE:  WALL STREET JOURNALREFERENCE: 04/15/93, pB1HEADLINE: Lyme-Disease Ruling Raises Liability IssuesThe tick that causes Lyme disease may have found a new way to causedamage: legal liability.A federal judge's decision holding a property owner liable for notdoing enough to protect workers from Lyme disease is getting as muchattention as the latest medical study on the disease, a flu-likeillness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and inrare instances death. The decision last week has put property ownerson notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves fromthe ticks-they also may have to protect themselves from litigation ifsomeone becomes infected while on the property.The decision by U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward in New York cameafter a week-long trial in a case involving four track workers for theLong Island Railroad. Judge Ward found that the workers contracted thedisease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job. He orderedthe New York state-owned commuter line to pay the workers more than$560,000 to compensate for pain and suffering, in addition to medicalexpenses and lost wages.Summer camps, schools, companies with facilities in rural orsemirural areas, and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among thegroups that need to be worried about this ruling, says Stephen L.Kass, an attorney at New York law firm Berle, Kass & Case, who wrote alegal article three years ago warning property owners of the potentialliability. Even a family that invites friends over for a backyardbarbecue might be potentially liable.Lawsuits for insect bites, while rare, aren't unheard-of. A summervacationer in Southampton, N.Y., last year sued the owner of the homeshe rented, claiming that a tick on the property gave her RockyMountain spotted fever. In 1988, also on Long Island, a jury orderedan outdoor restaurant to pay more than $3 million to a patron who wasstung by a bee, causing an allergic reaction and permanentquadriplegia. The judge later threw out the award, citing no evidencethat a beehive was near the restaurant.But lawyers say that the attention to Lyme disease throughout thecountry -- it's most prevalent in New England, the Middle Atlanticstates, Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Northwest -- may make thisparticular insect bite a particularly litigious one.The illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in thecourtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers willcover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for notdiagnosing the disease.Lawyers say worker's-compensation claims related to Lyme diseasehave become common in some states in recent years. Payments inworker's-compensation cases, however, are limited to medical costs andlost earnings.The case before Judge Ward dealt with a potentially much morelucrative avenue for damages, because it involved the question ofnegligence. Unlike the worker's compensation process, the law governinginjuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and, as aresult, for additional payments for pain and suffering. Propertyowners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in manyother situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry thedisease.Ira M. Maurer, a partner at New York law firm Elkind, Flynn &Maurer, who represented the rail workers, says the decision will helpto establish "the duty of all sorts of property owners to protectagainst Lyme disease."Lawyers caution that despite Judge Ward's decision, winning alawsuit for damages caused by Lyme disease may prove difficult. Forone thing, victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down whenand where they got the tick bite. Judge Ward found that the plaintiffsin the railroad case got Lyme disease while working on property ownedby the railroad, even though none of the men remembered being bitten.The workers, who weren't outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere tothe insects, said they saw ticks in the high grass that surroundedsome work sites.A spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof thatthe four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad isconsidering an appeal. The railroad also disputes Judge Ward's findingthat it didn't do enough to protect employees. The spokeswoman saysthe railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and specialpants to protect against bug bites.Debate in the scientific community over Lyme disease could open upsome legal defenses for property owners, such as questioning whether avictim actually has the disease rather than some other illness.Earlier this week, the Journal of the American Medical Associationreported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having Lyme disease.And damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medicaldisputes over the degree of harm that Lyme disease causes.Because of health and safety concerns, some groups and companiesalready take special measures to protect against Lyme disease. Lastyear, at its headquarters in Franklin Lakes, N.J., Becton, Dickinson &Co. began using Damminix, a pesticide made by EcoHealth Inc. of Bostonthat is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease. The medical-supply company's headquarters include a 120-acre park, and the companywas worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation mightget infected.Ruth Lister, a spokeswoman for the American Camping Association inIndianapolis, says that many youth camps accredited by herorganization also have begun to check children for ticks. And CaroleKatz, a member of the board of the Fire Island Pines Property OwnersAssociation, says her group spends $30,000 each year to treat their100-acre site off the coast of New York with the tick-killingpesticide.=====*=====TITLE: Urinary dysfunction in Lyme disease.AUTHORS: Chancellor MB; McGinnis DE; Shenot PJ; Kiilholma P; Hirsch IH,Department of Urology, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas JeffersonUniversity, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.REFERENCE: J Urol 1993 Jan; 149 (1): 26-30Lyme disease, which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, isassociated with a variety of neurological sequelae.  We describe 7 patientswith neuro-borreliosis who also had lower urinary tract dysfunction.Urodynamic evaluation revealed detrusor hyperreflexia in 5 patients anddetrusor areflexia in 2.  Detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia was notnoted on electromyography in any patient.  We observed that the urinary tractmay be involved in 2 respects in the course of Lyme  disease: 1) voidingdysfunction may be part of neuro-borreliosis and 2) the spirochete maydirectly invade the urinary tract.  In 1 patient bladder infection by theLyme spirochete was documented on biopsy.  Neurological and urologicalsymptoms in all patients were slow to resolve and convalescence wasprotracted.  Relapses of active Lyme disease and residual neurologicaldeficits were common.  Urologists practicing in areas endemic for Lymedisease need to be aware of B. burgdorferi infection in the differentialdiagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction.  Conservative bladdermanagement including clean intermittent catheterization guided by urodynamicevaluation is recommended.IV. ***** QUESTIONS 'N' ANSWERS *****Note: If you have a response to this question, please forward it to theeditor.Sender: Terry Morse <morset@ccmail.orst.edu>Subject: Question on Lyme Vectors and Compost Piles  When I visited my sister on Long Island, NY, I was cautioned to avoid thecompost heap in her back yard, as she thinks this is where she becameinfected.

Children diagnosed with ADD   who are placed on this diet show no improvement in their intellectual and   social skills, which in fact continue to decline.  Of course, the parents   who are enthusiastic about this approach lap it up at the expense of their   children's development.  So much for the value of "interesting anecdotal   results".

I don't think itis a reaction to sugar or junk food per se since Kathryn has never shownany signs of hyperactivity or changes in behavior in response to food.She has always been very calm and dare I say, a neat, smart kid.The fact that this happened while eating two sugar coated cereals madeby Kellog's makes me think she might be having an allergic reaction tosomething in the coating or the cereals.  Of the four of us in ourimmediate family, Kathryn shows the least signs of the hay fever, runningnose, itchy eyes, etc. but we have a lot of allergies in our family historyincluding some weird food allergies - nuts, mushrooms. Anyway, our next trip is to an endocrinologist to check out the bodychemistry.  But so far, no more sugar coated cereals and no more seizureseither.

My brother got stung by a bee. I knowhe is allergic to bee stings, but that his reaction is severe localizedswelling, not anaphylactic shock. I could not convince the doctors of that,however, because that's not written in their little rule book.I would not be surprised in the least to find out the SOME people have badreactions to MSG, including headaches, stomachaches and even vomiting.

Do I assume correctly from the above aricle that your mother has a historyyof cancer?  I was just wondeing, since you mentioned thhat she has anoncologist.A bone scan is a nuclear scan.  Thperson receivving the scan is gven adose of a radioactive tracer, and an imaging device is used to track thedistribution of the tracer wwithin the body.  The tracer is usually givenintravenously.  (IV) This means that the physician or his assistant willinsert a needle into a vein and inject  medicine into the vein. After a few minutes has passed for the tracer to circulate through thebody, the person is scanned with an imaging device to detect high concentrations of the tracer.  The radiologist or doctor is looking forareas that take up more of the radioactive tracer or less of it.As far as pain, the only pain comes from the needle stick that is requiredto start the IV line.What the doctor is probably looking for are changes in the bones that mayhave resulted from cancer.  This is also why I was wondering if your motherhas had cancer, since cancer can spread from one site and wind up in theskeletal system.I hope I have answered some of your questions.  Feel free to e-mail me ifyou have more questions related to the bone scan or anything else relatedto your mother's care.

The author stated this with pride, as thoughit were some sort of virtue! Why am I sceptical about homeopathy?

You are making precisely one of the points I wanted to make.I fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between the*process* of science and the end result.  As an end result of science, one wants to get results that areobjectively verifiable.  But there is nothing objective about the*process* of science.  If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some meritto homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information.But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.  Thisis where you and I disagree with Turpin.  In order to have science, onemust have a theoretical structure that makes sense, not a merecollection of empirically validated random hypotheses.Experiment and empirical studies are an important part of science, butthey are merely the culmination of scientific research.  The mostimportant part of true scientific methodology is SCIENTIFIC THINKING.  Without this, one does not have any hypotheses worth testing.  (No,hypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data.Nor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you're shaving orlooking out the window.  At least not unless you've done a lot of reallygood thinking beforehand.)  The difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocrescientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology.  It depends on the quality of their THINKING.  It really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe thatthey are doing science merely because they are conducting empiricalstudies.  And it bothers me even more that there are many fields, such ascertain parts of psychology, where there seems to be no thinking at all, but mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses.  And I'm especially offended by Russell Turpin's repeated assertion thatscience amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes.  Simply avoidingmistakes doesn't get you anywhere.  --In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet

In normal condition, the concentration of glutamate in the cerebrospinal fluid is about 2 uM that is high enough to activate one type of glutamate receptor-the NMDAreceptor. But the question is Neuron and glial cell in the brain have a lots of transport to get glutamate into Neuron or glial. So no one know exact concentration of glutamate is around neurons. Glutamate is most important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. It is involved in not only in daily life like the controling of movement, it is alsoinvolved in develpoment, memory and learn (it is involved in Logn-term potentialtion that be thought is the basis of learning).

I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienceda seizure on November 3, 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog's FrostedFlakes.  She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything likethis before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of thefamily.  All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decisionwas made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again.Well, we were going along fine and the other morning, April 5, she hada bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal, Fruit Loops (I amembarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every oncein a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think "Oh, oh, this is thesame kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure."  Ten minutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposureto a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure.When I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason forthe seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea.  Nowafter this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, evenhe is scratching his head.  Once again her EEG looks normal which Iunderstand can happen even when a person has a seizure.Once again we are waiting. I have been thinking that it would be goodto get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has anyexperience with this kind of thing.  I know that members of the medicalcommunity are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet andfoods play in our general health and well-being.  Anyway, as you canguess, I am worried sick about this, and would appreciate any ideasanyone out there has.  Sorry to be so wordy but I wanted to really getacross what is going on here.Thanks.--Sharon Paulson                      s.s.paulson@larc.nasa.govNASA Langley Research CenterBldg. 1192D, Mailstop 156           Work: (804) 864-2241Hampton, Virginia.  23681           Home: (804) 596-2362

Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and Intensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin June 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours per day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.  Fellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact Steven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and TechnologyManagement Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number oraddress below.  ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.  ########################################################################################   New Program Announcement   ###############################################################################################            JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAMThe Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a newprogram jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon University.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and January 1994.PROGRAM OBJECTIVESThe program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the United States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managersexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities andlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to developlong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.PROGRAM DESIGNTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan andits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGESeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive coursesdesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in arelatively short time.2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTUREA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of thecultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,Sociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiumswill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or research facilities in the United States will be scheduled.3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPANUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japanwill generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.FELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL ASSTIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.

She has been to a doctor and taken the ordinary (?)tests and her values were regarded as low. The doctor (and my wife) arenot very interested in starting medication as this "deactivates" the gland, giving life-long dependency to the drug (hormone?). The last couple of monthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath (sp?) and been givensome drops to re-activate either her thyroidal gland and/or the 'message-center' in the brain (sorry about the approximate language,but I haven't got many clues to what the english terms are, but the brain-area is called the 'hypofyse' in norwegian.) My questions are: has anyone had/heard of success in using this approach?Her values have been (slowly but) steadily sinking, any comment on theprobability of improvement? Although the doctor has told her to 'eatnormally', my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feelsthat is part of keeping an edge over the illness/condition, may thisaffect the treatment, development?I can get the exact figures for her tests for anyone interested, and Iwill greatly value any information/opinion/experience on this topic.I don't intend this post to be either a flaming of the establishedmedical profession or a praise for alternatives, I am just relayingevents as they have happened.Sincerely,Erik A.

Nor am I prepared to give a general account ofrationality.  In terms of examples, there is some danger of beginning to quibbleover what a "surprising" experiment is, what counts as "surprising", etc.The same may be said about "logical grounds".  My point is that quite frequently(perhaps even most frequently) the roots of a new theory can be traced topreviously existing theories (or even to previously rejected hypotheses ofsome other theory or domain).  I would offer some rather well known examplessuch as Toricelli's Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his "sea of air"hypothesis.  Was this theory (and the resulting experimental test) "surprising"?Well, given the *prior* explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly mustbe counted as so.  Was the theory constructed (and the experiment designed)out of "perfectly rational grounds"?  Well, there was a pretty successful andwell know theory of fluids.  The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit.The novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid (but this was *quite* a noveltyat the time).  Was the theory interesting?  Yes.  Was it "new"?  Well, onecould argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a newdomain, but I think this begs certain questions.  We can debate that if youlike.-- Gary H.

Later,  when she (a youngwoman of unimpeachible virtue) was shown to be pregnant; the soldier didthe honorable thing of marrying her.  According to this story, they livedhappily ever after.  Perhaps the most famous of Mr. Rau's classes was the time he would comeinto class brandishing an aluminum turning mandrel  (tapering from about3/8" to 1/2" over a 10 inch length).  He would say, "Boys, do you knowwhat this is?  It's a medical instrument called a 'cock reamer' and it'sused to unclog your penis when you have VD.  They just ram it up therewithout an anesthetic!"  Needless to say this had a chilling effect.I didn't have lascivious thoughts for at least an hour.

The user interface is inEnglish, however the terms of medical specialties I was given are inFrench :-( I have no medical dictionary handy, mine is a technicaluniversity :-((I need to get the translation into English (when there is one) of thefollowing words. They refer to medical categories of operating rooms(theaters). I admit they may not be universally "used".1- sceptique2- orl3- brulure/brule'4- ne'onatal5- pre'natal6- pre'mature'7- neurochirurgie (neuro-surgery??)8- chirurgie ge'ne'rale9- chirurgie plastique10- urologie (urology??)Thank you for you help.Cheers,---------Berthe Y.

I had kind of an odd experience on a group hikerecently, becoming dehyrated after about 9 hours of rigoroushiking despite having brought 1 1/2 gallons of water (c. 6 liters).I drank close to twice as much as anyone else, and no one else wasdehydrated.  I don't think general physical condition was an issue,since I was in at least the middle of the pack in terms of generalstamina, so far as I could tell.It may be that I just plain need more water than most people.  But I amwondering if theophylline and/or ephedrine might be aggravating things.I took a couple of Primatene tablets during the hike to control asthma(24 mg. ephedrine, 100 mg. theophylline).  I gather that both thosedrugs are diuretics.  So now I'm wondering: does that mean they canreduce the body's ability to utilize available water?  Would it be aparticularly  stupid thing to take that medication during hot-weatherexercise?  (I always assumed diuresis just meant you urinated a lot, butthat wasn't the case yesterday.)

As I understand, these are all short term.I second what Spenser Aden said in reply.  Additionally, it is hard to saywhat type of response you ar3e having to prednisone since you did not sayhow long you have been on it.  Patients are generally kept on steroids formonths before thinking about tapering.  Alternatives to daily dosing are every other day dosing, in your case 20mg every other day would be a start.Another option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to startazathioprine.  Like Spenser said, you should generally be on another drugin addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine.  A lot of the specificsabout options, though, depends on severity, location, and duration of disease, as well as histology, so take advice off the net for what itis worth.  I treat patients with UC and Crohn's.  An educated patient is a good patient, but let your doctor know where the advice came from so thingscan be put in context.

Exploiting my lastname to discredit me on the issue is hitting below the belt.What I am interested in is the truth. Let me give you an excert froma recent FDA hearing:           ``There is no evidence orally consumed glutamate has any effecton the brain,'' said Dr. Richard Wurtman of Massachusetts Instituteof Technology. The anecdotal experiences of individuals is``superstition, not science,'' he said. ``I don't think glutamatehas made them sick.''And Dr. Robert Kenney of George Washington University conducted an doubleblind test in 1980 showing that the 35 people who reacted to MSG alsohad similar reaction when they thought they had MSG but actually not.Although there are many contradicting personal stories told in this group,some of them might have been due to other causes. But because the anti MSGemotion runs so high, that some blame it for anything and everything. My purpose is to present a balance view on the issue, although I am probably20-1 outnumbered.Jason Chen

Such "extra->rational" cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology.As has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_and _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it isdescribed in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replicationsdo indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should beaccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, andreasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.But people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazyreasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are alarge part of the history of science.There are a couple of negative points to make here:1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without directverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an acceptedpart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  Whatwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medicalreality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim couldlie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body ofexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.(I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.I don't think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much lessa theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And itis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of ratherdirectly verifying the existence of qi.)2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rationalexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, andinterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoreticalcontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,there is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,petty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and whichcomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the criticalfunction of science: results don't count unless they can be replicated.The whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generatepart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.Pasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;but even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;that when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotatepolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version wasindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur's irrational motivation hadled to a replicable, and important, result.This is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually noteven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.

Thanks for your assistance.Outbreaks of a chronic-mono-like entity were originally called EBS (orsome variant thereof) because most of the people with this disease hadelevated levels of antibodies to the EBV virus. But not all of themdid, which prompted an official renaming of the disease to ChronicFatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of InternalMedicine, Jan. 1988, I believe). Now it's also called Chronic Fatigueand Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), since it seems clear thatsome sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs.Astonishly, there are still docs who tell people with massivelyswollen glands, recurrent fevers and nightsweats, etc., that there'snothing wrong with them. This is not the same thing as saying that thesyndrome may have a (at least partly) psychological cause. Thedisagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centerson just what the cause is. No one knows, but theories include:psychological stress, some sort of virus (a retrovirus, say most --maybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses), environmentaltoxins, bacteria (and, yes, candida), genes, (and/)or some combo ofthese.There's no outright cure at the moment, but different docs trydifferent things, some of which seem to help.Massive amounts of info on the condition are available these days.Post your Q to alt.med.cfs, and you will be flooded w/facts.Note: There are lots of far better understood (and better treatable)diseases that look like CFIDS. Make sure these get ruled-out by a gooddoc.

My definitionis this: Science is the investigation of the empirical that avoidsmistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previouswork.  Lee Lady writes:> I don't think that science should be defined in a way that some > of the activities that lead to really important science --- namely> thinking and informal exploration --- are not recognized as> scientific work.  Unless one classifies "thinking and informal exploration" as amistake, they fall under my definition.  I hope no one wouldconsider speculation, thinking, and informal exploration asunscientific.

It is notclear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should betaken as describing what "science is mainly about."  Consider,for example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lackinga backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate andwhat is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you whatinvertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition andstill not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates,that invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, thatsome invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- areubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing thedefinition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are"mainly about."The misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficientcontext for people to understand my proposed definition.> Okay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees > of certainty.

I agree on both counts.  As an example of the second, it would onlytake a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinariansthat a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls.  As to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk about"absolute scientific truth."  I think it is more useful to talkabout the kinds of evidence that various claims have and thekinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past haveproven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter ofdegree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover therelevance of different kinds of evidence.  One of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea aspsuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportionregarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim,the kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and thehistorical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidenceare given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright tospeculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers thatspeculated left and right.  But the authors were careful toidentify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidencewas presently available for them, and to describe how researchcould proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or touncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paperof this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which theauthor sets the context and paves the way for future work.  (Itis in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail.)> The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to> make this simple test.

I think a lot of scientists steer away from things that --deserving or not -- garner a patina of kookiness.  Whenproponents of some practice see no value in more carefulinvestigation of that practice, that sets alarms ringing in manyresearchers' minds.  This is unfortunate, because there is undoubtedly someintersection between things that are worth investigating andthings that are advocated by those who seem careless orunreasonable in their advocacy.  On the other hand, I canunderstand why many scientists would just as soon select otherdirections for research.  As Gordon Banks has pointed out, no onewants to become this generation's Rhine.> One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely > unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't > been described in a scientific journal. ...I think this is absurd.  > Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done > (with favorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because> it's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.I wonder why the results were not published.  In my field,dissertation results are typically summarized in papers that aresubmitted to journals.  Often the papers are accepted forpublication before the dissertation is finished.  (This certainlyeases one's defense.)Finally, I hope Lee Lady will forgive me from commenting eitheron NLP or the discussion of it in sci.psychology.  I know littleabout either and so have nothing to offer.Russell

The demonstration to which you refer consists of placing a leaf betweenthe plates, and taking a Kirlian photograph of it.  You then cut off part ofthe leaf, put the top plate back on, and take another Kirlian photograph.  Yousee pretty much the same image in both cases.

"That particular photograph" ... ?  That'sright, the effect has been observed only once.  Even the writers ofthe book were inclined to disbelieve in it.  I conjecture that the maker of that photograph began by placinga whole leaf between two plates and taking its Kirlian photo.For his next experiment, he cut the leaf in half, put one half downbetween the same two plates, and took another K. p.  The"missing half" effect was created by water, oils, etc. left behind after the first photo.This explanation must be tentative, because after all I wasn't therewhen it happened.

My Internist, who diagnosed my AV block, slow heart rateand PVC's, told me something different. She says that heart rate isassociated with the electrical properties of the hear muscle, not itssize. Exercise lowers heart rate and increases stroke volume, but theeffects are unrelated except for their common source. The AV block, sheasserts, is another electrical effect, which is irreversable - even whenexercise is dicontinued. PVC's are also common in runners.

It is best to do nothing, besides taking some painmedication initially. Some patients don't like this and expect, or demand,to have something done. In these cases some physicians will "tape" the patient (put a lot of heavy adhesive tape around the chest), or prescribean elastic binder. All this does is make it harder to breath, but thepatient doesn't feel cheated, because soemthing is being done about theproblem. Either way, the end results are the same.==================================Howard Doyledoyle+@pitt.edu

I appliedto about 20 schools, got two interviews, got one offer, and am waiting tohear from the other school.Let me be honest about my experiences and impressions about the medicalschool admissions process.  Numbers (GPA, MCATs) are not everything, but they are probably more important than anything else.  In fact, someschools screen out applicants based on these numbers and never even lookat your other qualities.  Of course, when this happens, don't expect a refundon your $50 application fee.But, the fact that you got four interviews tells me that you have the numbersand are very well qualified academically.  You mentioned one response, was itan acceptance, denial, or wait-list?  If I assume the worst, that it was adenial, then you still have a great probability of acceptance somewhere.  Howdid your interviews go?As for how long you have to wait, I've called a few schools who never contactedme for anything.  Many of them told me that the interview season for them wasover and that if I haven't heard by now, I can assume a denial.  Many rejectionletters are not sent out until May or as late as June.  But some schools arestill interviewing. I really don't think you should worry.  Don't becomefixated on the mailbox, go out, have fun, be very proud of yourself.What do people think of the medical school admissions process?  I had a verymediocre GPA, but high MCAT scores, and I have been working as a softwareengineer for two years.  I majored in Computer Science at Stanford.  Still,I think the profile of the person who has the best chance of getting admittedis something like this:VERY IMPORTANT--------------GPA:3.5 or betterMCAT:   top 15% in all subjectMEDIUM IMPORTANCE-----------------Writing/Speaking abilityMaturityMotivation for going into medicineActivitiesLESS IMPORTANT--------------College or UniversityMajorWork experienceAnything else you want them to knowAnyway, you are in good shape.  I think admissions committees are bound inmany ways by the numbers, but would like very much to understand eachperson as an individual.  Sometimes thats just not practical.  But getting four interviews is an indicator that you have the numbers.  Hopefully, youwere able to impress them with your character.Good luck,Jeff

Persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical,biochemical, or histologic evidence of liver disease, or they may have chronicpersistent hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellularcarcinoma.Most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) are probably the result ofa viral infection, although in a good number of cases the cause cannot bedetermined. The diagnosis of CPH is made on the basis of liver biopsy. Itconsists of findings of portal inflammation, an intact periportal limitingplate, and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis. But in contrastto chronic active hepatitis (CAH) there is no periportal inflammation, bridging necrosis, or fibrosis. CPH has, indeed, an excellent prognosis. If I had to choose between CAH andCPH there is no question I would also choose CPH. However, as David pointedout, the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would haveit. The histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal, with biopsies showingareas compatible with both CPH and CAH. Maybe it is a sampling problem. Maybeit is a continuum. I don't know.=================================Howard Doyledoyle+@pitt.edu

While I was a student, I had doctors removerather surprising amounts of wax from my ears by flushing them out a coupletimes, usually because they were examining my ears for some other reason, andsaid something like "Gee, you've got a lot of wax in there".  In my case,removal of these large wax buildups did noticeably improve my hearing, andI've since gotten in the same habit as your wife of flushing them out withwarm water from a little rubber bulb every few months.  You can buy littlebulbs together with ear drops for this express purpose from the drug store -I don't notice that the drops accomplish much of anything.One question I do have - a doctor who flushed out my ears once also advocateda drop of rubbing alcohol in them afterwards to flush out any remainingtrapped water - said he told swimmers to do this after swimming, too.  Itworks, but it stings like the devil, so I've always been content to let anywater in my ears from swimming or flushing them out figure out how to getout by itself if shaking my head a few times won't do the trick.  Anycomments?

Although the doctor has told her to 'eat>normally', my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feels>that is part of keeping an edge over the illness/condition, may this>affect the treatment, development?>There are several different types of Thyroid diseases which would causea hypothyroid condition (reduction in the output of the thyroid, mainlythyroxin). Except for ones caused by infections, the treatment isgenerally thyroxin pills. Hypothyroid conditions caused by infectionsusually disappear when the infection does...this doesn't sound like thecase with your wife.Thyroxin orally does "shut down the thyroid" through a feedback loopinvolving the pituitary (I believe). The pituitary "thinks" that thecorrect amount of thyroxin is being produced so it doesn't have totell the thyroid to produce more. This process is reversable! I haveHashimoto's thyroiditis (an autoimmune condition) and was on thyroxinfor approx 6 mo when my endocrinologist suggested I not take the pillsfor 6 wks. When I was retested for thyroxin levels, they were normal.I still get tested every 6mo because the condition might reappear.The pills are safe and have very few side-affects (& those mostly atbeginning of treatment). Having a baby might be a problem and would atleast require closer monitoring of hormone levels.Thyroxin controls energy production which explains sleepiness, coldness,and weight gain. There is also water retention (possibly around heart),changes in vision, and coarser hair and skin among other things.I am not a doctor, so I'm sure I mistated something, but the importantthing is that thyroid problems are usually easily corrected and if theyaren't corrected can cause problems in the rest of the body. Get asecond opinion from a good endocrinologist and have him/her explainthings in detail to you and your wife.- Eileen Bauer
