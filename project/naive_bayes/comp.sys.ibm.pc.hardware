 26Hi to all you PC gurus!I'm new to these groups and so please forgive me if my questions are frequentlyasked, but I don't know the answer :) I've been recently having some problemswith my 386 computer with a Seagate 40 meg hard drive. I occasionally findcorrupted files, but most of the time programs work fine. Are there any utilitiesthat are easily available that can help me determine whether or not the problemis a result of the hard drive vs an ill-behaved program or some other hardwareitem? Are there utilites to determine whether or not the hard drive is properlyaligned etc? As might be expected, I would greatly appreciate any help on thismatter. I'm considering just reformatting the disk and reinstalling everything(and hoping that will fix the problem), but I would like to have some assuranceof what the problem cause is. Also, can someone give me an opinion on DOS 6.0? Are the compression anddefragmentation routines good enough to consider the upgrade if I don't havethose routines already (as opposed to buying them separately)? Much thanks in advance for any help.Mitchel Soltyssoltys@radonc.unc.edu
 21Hi,I've got a Victor PC/XT with a 20 MB harddisk in it. The controller isa Toshiba MFM controller, with an additional 9 pins connector.There are 2 busses from my harddisk to this controller. One with 9 wiresand another with 34 wires.The controller has two connectors for a 9 wire-bus and one for a 34 wirebus.Now I got a 20 MB harddisk from a friend of mine, and I wondered whetherI can connect this second harddisk to the same controller (there is roomfor a 9 wire-bus, but not for the 34 wire bus)How can I solve my problem, any suggestions?If you need more info, mail me, please (luttik@fwi.uva.nl).--Bas.

 128Nntp-Posting-Host: eniac.seas.upenn.eduHello.  I hope somebody out here can help me.  I am currently workingon a project where I am trying to communicate from an IBM 386 withPhoenix BIOS, using C++, to a board that I made with an Intel 8085 CPUwith UART chip.  The board works fine with the TRANSMIT command and Terminal Emulation mode of Kermit, but there seems to be something wrongwith the initialization or protocol used when I try C++.  I need toaccess the unit I built using C, because I have a sizable chunk of Ccode that I will be using to perform calculations and operations thatwill be very difficult to code in assembly language for the 8085.I have included the assembly code that I am running and the C++ codethat I am trying to use.  If anyone can show me something that Iam doing blatantly incorrectly or that I am missing because of my lackof knowledge about RS-232 serial communications, please e-mail me.I wrote the assembly language to wait for a character to be received andthen to check it against the 0x20 character, if a 0x20 is received, the LEDs will indicate this.  Two C++ programs that I have written donothing, but set up COM port 2 and send the 0x20 character.  One usesthe bioscom() function in bios.h the other uses the software interruptint86() function in dos.h.  I have triple checked the baud rate ( 2400 )the parity ( none ) the stop bits ( 1 ) the character length ( 8 bits )and the interrupt calls for ( 0x14 ).  Currently, I am at a loss asto what may be wrong.

Thanks.   A program in the archive keymap00.zip on simtel and mirror sites in the msdos/keyboard directory will do this.  It is written in assembler and it best if you have a compiler to create a new keyboard map.  It is possible, however, to use a binary editor to edit the provided compiled keyboard driver if you do not have a compiler.  I used hexed100.zip, also available on simtel.  Simply serach for the codes 00 01 02 03 to locate the biginning of the "normal" keyboard map.  Then swap the codes for the keys that you wish to swap.  See the keyboard directory of simtel for programs that report the scancode for each key to you (some bios programs also have this info).Good luck,- Pete____________________________________________________________________________| Peter J.

 16Nntp-Posting-Host: astro.ocis.temple.eduX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]This may be the dumbest question of the year, but is there away to 'piggyback' or expand a 6-slot motherboard (all 16-bit)to get the usual 8?  My case has slots for 8, and I'd like toget a scanner, but with all my other cards I'm already max'd out!I'm hoping that a simple solution exists, e.g. an adapter that turnsone slot into three.  I don't mind if it turns it into 8-bit slots,as I can put my I/O card, MIDI card, and Soundblaster card there.My other cards are 16 bit (IDE/Floppy, SVGA, modem).If there is such an expander, does that screw up performance ofeverything else?

The fact that the PPI worked okay for you is becauseit is setup more for the no nothing user that can't understand theinstruction and the commands to configure it to his/her system.When you find out things like the fact the the EC led that looks likeyou have connected to another EC modem, doesn't realy say that.But that it only tells you that you have EC turned on, on your modem.I think that these LED are nothing more that just light to hype upthe product. Just like I bet someone took home a few extra $$$in the last year for giving the PPI modems the PC-Magazine awardof the year. Not so for the stash (12) of them that I saw on my testbench. I could go on for hours at no end as to all of the problemsthat I found with the PPI modems but I will try to control myself.I will not even go into the 6 weeks it took PPI to credit my cardback for the modems after they had received them back...no I willnot go into that one nor will I go into talking to the parent co.co from Hayes. I'll just say I hope you like your new modem andmaybe someone that can understand how to setup a modem will getthe one that you sent back, maybe a good friend of mine I hope!-- Gosh..I think I just installed a virus..It was called MS DOS6...Don't copy that floppy..BURN IT...I just love Windows...CRASH...

COM3, for example, is simply the third equipped COMMport, not necessarily the one with I/O address 3E8.  The BIOS justsearches sequentially through a set of potential COMM port addresses.  Thefirst equipped port it finds will become COM1, etc.  If you're playing bythe rules, you can't have a COM4 unless you have a COM3 equipped.  The setof "standard" (whatever that means) port addresses merely reflects theorder in which the BIOS searches the I/O address space in its search forserial ports.So, what you have is indeed COM3 at the non-standard address 2E8.  Werethis address in the 4th table slot instead, programs which query the BIOSto determine the number of installed COMM ports would not find it, as thefield in the BIOS data area which contains this number would indicate thatthere are but 3 COMM ports installed.

 37HELP!!  This morning I turned on my computer..to be greated with a poppingnoise from the monitor.  I quickly looked thru the top right vent and tomy disbelief saw orange flame and smelled smoke!  Great...I opened it up to see what I could see (it's 4 years old, no warrenty for me).On one of the pc boards there was a resistor that had been majorlyfryed..burnt to a crisp..can't even tell what value it is.  This is theonly pjhysical damage I can find.  But to my knowledge, resistors don'tjust randomly blow.  What could have happened??  A voltage regulatorproblem..?  The fuses nearby are intact...great job.  I have 2 thoughts asto why it did this.  One, over the winter I was ruinning a humidifier forabout 6 weeks, although it was halfway across the room.  Could moisturedone this?  I last used it over a month ago.  Second, as most peopledo...I never use the power switches on the CPU or moinitor.  I haveeverything plugged into a surge protector and I turn the whole shebang onwith it.  Now, is this bad???  Should I quit doing it?  Is my systemgetting too much power or varrying power this way when activated?Now...before I take it to a repaoir shop I want to replace the resistor tosee what happens.  But I have no idea what value it is.  Or even if thatwould fix things..would it just blow again??  Right now, when I plug it inand turn it on I don't even get the power LED..a power supply prolem??Should I bother tracking down this resistor value or take it to a shop?? It is resistor R830.  It's near the metal shield thatshgields..something..near a large black electrolytic capacitor.  It's onthe right most pc board.  The monitor is an Imtec 1455N, from mid-1989.Does someone have schematics for this?  Or would someone be willing totake theirs apart and see what value R830 is???  Basically, what the hellshould I do to get this thing fixed for the cheapest amont in the least time.I have crosposted this article.  Please respond via email with any help orsuggestions.  Also, does anyone have Imtecs phone or address??  My manuallacks either from what I can see.  Please respons VIA EMAIL ONLY!!!Needless to say, with no computer I don't have the leisure of scanninggroups while bothering my friend to use his computer/modem.Help..this really bites and I need it working ASAP!!!
 36I am trying to help a friend of mine get the second serial port on his DTKI/O Plus II card working and it does not want to cooperate. The documentationis no help at all. As an example, it says 'The serial port can be changed toCOM2 from COM1 by moving jumpers.' but does not say what jumpers to move!! :-(There are 2 banks of jumpers. The first one is labeled as follows:C1C2S2P2P1GThe second bank is labeled "IRQ" and has the following labels:5C5S433S2C2SI have determined that the C1 & C2 jumpers tell it to address the firstserial port as COM1 or COM2. The P1,P2 jumpers tell it to use the printerport as LPT1 or LPT2. I am guessing that the "G" enables the game port andthe "S2" SHOULD enable the second serial port, but I can't get it to work. Ihave tried numerous setting on the IRQ bank without success. I assume thatthis bank must tell the card which IRQ's to use for both ports, but I don;tknow how.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!EBD-- Elliot Dierksen   "Is that a real poncho... I mean is that a Mexican poncho or                   is that a Sears  poncho?

 35I have a 486sx25 computer with a 105 Mg Seagate IDE drive and a controler  built into the motherboard. I want to add a SCSI drive (a quantum prodrive  425F 425 MG formatted). I have no documentation at all and I need your  help!As I understand it, here is the process of adding such a drive.  Could you  please tell me if I'm right..1- Buy a SCSI contoler.  Which one? I know Adaptec is good, but they are  kind of expensive.  Are there any good boards in the $100 region? I want  it to be compatible with OS2 and Unix if possible.  Also, I have seen on  the net that there are SCSI and SCSI2 drives. Is this true? Does the  adapter need to be the same as the drive? What type of drive is the  quantum?2- connect the drive to the adapter via a SCSI cable and the power cable.Do i have to worry about the power supply? I think I have 200 watts and  all I'm powering are two floppies and the seagate drive.3- Setup the BIOS to recognize the drive as the second drive.  What type  of drive is this? I don't have the numbers for this drive.4- Format and create partitions on the drive. Do I use format or fdisk? I  think that IDE drives can't be low-level formatted. Is it the same with  SCSI? How exactly does fdisk work? I have a reduced msdos 5.0 manual  (clone obliges) and there is no mention of fdisk.  Ideally, I would want  the drive partitioned in to two partitions D: and E: how do I do this?Well that seems to be all. Is there anythiing I'm forgetting? Any help is *really* appreciated, I'm lost...-Ericebosco@us.oracle.com

 25Help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My computer from Gateway is freezing up on me.Gateway tech support couldn't help me. They want more specifics on whenit freezes up.  I DID!  Anyway, here it is.  If the keyboard is left idlein Dos for more than 15 minutes, I can type on the command line, but as soon as I hit a carraige return, the computer locks up.  This will happenalmost every time, whether I've just booted up, reset, or finished using ados program.  Everything works fine if I don't let it sit.  Windows is adifferent story.  If I let the machine sit while in windows for 15 minutesor more, it does not freeze up.  However,  I do get frequent applicationerrors that kick me out of an application unexpectedly, losing my work.I just don't know if this is a hardware or software problem.  Any helpin diagnosis or things to try, would be greatly appreciated.  P.S.

Some PC use this set up too.SCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burstSCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burstSCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst By your OWN data the "Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI" is correctWith a SCSI-2 controller chip SCSI-1 can reach 10MB/s which is indeed"20% faster than IDE" {120% of 8.3 is 9.96}. ALL these SCSI facts have beenposted to this newsgroup in my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare[version #].txt (It should be 173 but 161 may still be there)}Part of this problem is both Mac and IBM PC are inconsiant about what SCSIis which.  Though it is WELL documented that the Quadra has a SCSI-2 chipan Apple salesperson said "it uses a fast SCSI-1 chip" {Not at a 6MB/s,10MB/s burst it does not. SCSI-1 is 5MB/s maximum synchronous and Quadrauses ANsynchronous SCSI which is SLOWER}  It seems that Mac and IBM seeSCSI-1 interface and think 'SCSI-1' when it maybe a SCSI-1 interface drivenin the machine by a SCSi-2 controller chip in 8-bit mode {Which is MUCHFASTER then true SCSI-1 can go}.Don't slam an article because you don't understand what is going on.One reference for the Quadra's SCSI-2 controller chip is (Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1)).

 9Hi fellow netters,does anybody have any info on Tseng Labs ET4000 VLB card:price, speed, compatibility with existing and up-comming softwares,performance compared to others cards ( is it an S3 based card ?)....Thank you..
 11I recently purchased the then current Pkg.# 486dx-33 for $2395 (but changedto NEC 3FGx monitor upgrade). Buy this Pkg. #3 now - for $100 more, you nowget a bigger HD - 340mb with @256 HD cache. 30 days ago, when I bought thispkg., it was 245mb with @132K HD cache. This is a great deal although it isgenerally recommended you at least upgrade to the 15' Zeos (CTX) monitor for$99 more I believe.  Whether you also upgrade to the Diamond Viper videocard is your choice. I stayed with the Diamond Speedstar Pro. Zeos TechSupport is really good - call after normal business hours to get the fastest access. The hardest part about buying a Zeos is the wait till it isdelivered - once you order you can hardly wait to get it! There are quite afew good mail order houses around - lots of bang for buck with Zeos.

I personally like the non-etched NEC with the OCLI filter and the tube on the 17 was not as nice.  The 17 had some uncorrectable pincusion and edge distortion problems.  Also, it would change brightness when I switched modes and I was constantly having to fiddle with the controls.  And the yoke was crooked and I had no way to compensate for the raster that tilted downhill.  On the postive side, although not as handsome as the NEC, the 17 had a smaller footprint and was not as heavy.I have heard that Panasonic owns Viewsonic and the model 17 is being sold through OEM channels with a Panasonic label on it.  If it's available that way at a lower cost I could get more serious about it.  For now the NEC has my vote but I'm searching for one of the new, cheaper, NEC 5FGe's to see if it's just as good as its older brother the 5FG before I decide which one to buy.I have no experience with the Nanao.  I can never keep the Nanao models straight and don't have any place I can walk in to get a good comparison of all models.-- Standard employer disclaimers apply-- Keith W.

 53Please help if you can with the following strange problem:  The Maxtor 340 drive in my 386 clone would from time to  time, for no obvious reason spin down completely (one can  tell by the sound) and simply refuse to be accessed. DOS  reacts with an error (Drive D: cannot be accessed or  something the like). Unfortunately, I cannot just reproduce  the error. Sometimes it occurs more often, sometimes  less. The last time it happened was when I wanted to   demonstrate some software to a colleague.    I would like to know if anybody has experienced similar  problems. I don't like to take the thing to the dealer  only to be told that there's nothing wrong with it. I  checked the other post in this group about Maxtor, and  I don't seem to be the only one who has problems. However,  no one describes the same problem, and I also have a   different configuration.

I agree that the article COULD have stated that the "20%faster then IDE" came off a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 chip.  Maybe itwas there and the EDITOR killed it because the article was dealing withSCSI-1 NOT SCSI-2 and he did not understand the effect of a SCSI-1 devicewith a SCSI-2 controller chip.SCSI-1 chips are limited to 5/MB max.  SCSI-1 devices with SCSI-2 chips{becoming common} produce up to 10Mb/s in 8-bit mode and 20MB/s in 16-bitmode {the fast version, SCSI-1 ports cannot use wide SCSI}.  Of courcethe prime piece of wierdness is that SCSI-1 devices HAVE SCSI-2 chips{or more accurately the machine does}. This allows the best of BOTHworlds: high SCSI-2 speeds and cheeper SCSI-1 costs {FULL SCSI-2 hardware(port, electronic controller, etc) is VERY expensive.  It ALSO createsa logistic NIGHTMARE as to how fast SCSI-1 goes.When one knows the FACTS behind the numbers then one realizes that thearticle knows what it is talking about {even if it does not tell HOW thefigures came about} while  DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu is throwing outranges that don't tell SQUAT {Since he IGNORES SCSI-1 devices withSCSI-2 chips his ranges tell even LESS then intended.} }

(There's a price list for used synthesizers onrec.music.makers.synth, but no equivalent list for computers...)This system is tailor-made for a MIDI musician.  Details follow:  * Atari 1040 ST      TOS 1.0      1 MB RAM      720K floppy drive  * SupraDrive 20 Mb external SCSI drive, 18 months old  * 12" Atari monochrome monitor  * Generic 2400 baud external modem  * Software: All software is registered and comes with manuals.      Passport's Master Tracks Pro, Version 2.5 (sequencing software)      Dr. T's Copyist Professional (scoring software)      First Word (word processor - *not* the PD version)      Megamax's Laser C, Version 2.0 (programming language)      VIP Professional (spreadsheet package - low-tech Lotus clone)      Partner ST (desk accessory with integrated calendar, cardfile, etc.)      Migraph's Easy Draw (an early, pre-Postscript release)      NeoDesk (improved desktop for Atari ST)      Universal III (improved file selector for Atari ST)      Miscellaneous software (including Uniterm communications software)        I will consider all prices above $900.  I am also willing totrade the Atari system for a quality (386 or 486) PC, including lap-tops.I own some PC hardware, so a complete system may not be necessary.-- == John J.

It can also do 640x480x16 mil. and800x600x16 bit at 90Hz, too bad I don't have such a high bandwidth monitor like yours ;) ;) (most of those modes need a 78khz monitor,otherwise you'll have to use a lower refresh rate)  If you want more info. about the coming Graphite VL, you shouldgo to the IBM hardware section on Compuserve (IBMHW), in thevideo sig.

Are there alignment screws that you can adjust?The --VERY VERY FIRST-- thing you do is make sure that --ALL-- files onthe floppies that you can currently read in the drive, which aren'talready on your HD or another floppy (if you have -two- floppy drives)get copied to your HD (and/or to a floppy in your other drive).If you don't do this before fixing the alignment problem you have kissdthose files goodbye.  (Well, you can -try- to re-misalign the drive backto read your floppies, but don't count on be able to do so!)Generally, head alignment is something I'd only trust to a good repairshop (though there are/have been DIY guides).+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ Nick FitzGerald, PC Applications Consultant, CSC, Uni of Canterbury, N.Z. n.fitzgerald@csc.canterbury.ac.nz  TEL:+64(3)364 2337, FAX:+64(3)364 2332

This is actually how it is done in the lowprofile cases - a standard motherboard, the 'T' connector in one slot, and the expansion cards plugged into the 'T'.  I guess you could do this at each end of the slots (1 & 8) to add even more.  The 'T' connectors are simply tracks with slots on them - no electronicson it.

Itworks very well under OS/2, so I know that the drive is not faulty.In my config.sys, I have aspi3dos.sys, aspidisk.sys, aspicd.sys.  In my autoexec.bat, I have MSCDEX, which came with DOS 6.0.  MSCDEX seems to findand install the drive as drive F:, but when I switch to that drive and try adir, I get an error message telling me the drive is not ready or somethinglike that.  The CDROM is locked too, and the adaptec utilities don't seem torecognize that I have a CDROM at that point.Has anyone ever had this problem?  Is there something abvious that Iam missing?  And finally, I was wondering if anyone using this setup could kindly post his/her config.sys and autoexec.bat.Thank you very much!******************************************************************************** imj1@cunixa.cc.columbia.edu    Imad "Hexabyte" Jureidini **     The Ultimate Knight, Grand Priest of the Secrets of the Undefined.      ********************************************************************************

 43In case anyone was wondering about upgrading their 386 or 486 class machinewithout spending a lot of money, I looked into replacing the processoron those machines and here are the facts (as I understand them).If you have a PS/2 Model 70 or Model 80, you can replace the i386 chip witheither 1) a Cyrix 486DLC chip for $130 which will increase your processingpower by about 60% for normal fuctions, and not at all for math functions.This chip will only run at your original clock speed, ie. if you have a 16MHzmachine the Cyrix 486DLC will run at 16MHz.note: Windows does not use the math functions, so it is a good upgrade ifyou are running Windows.Or, 2) you can get a Kingston 486/NOW platform for $450 with a 25MHz i486SXon it which will increase your normal processing power by about 100%, if youwere running at 25MHz originally. But again it will not increase the speedof your math fuctions.  I think that it will continue to run at 25MHz evenif your original processor runs at a slower speed.There is also 3) the Kingston 486/NOW platform for $750 with a 33MHz i486DXon it.  This might speed up your math functions as well, but I am not sure.If you have a PS/2 Model 70 B21 or other PS/2 machine with either an i486SXor a non-clock doubling i486DX (ie. it runs at either 25 or 33MHz) in it,then you can get an Intel Overdrive chip (which is really an i486DX2 chip) andreplace your chip with it.  You should get about 95% better preformance forboth normal and math functions.  The 25/50 Mhz version of the Overdrive chipcosts $450 and the 33/66MHz version costs $700.  The replacement for the25MHz 486SX chip is an espeacially good deal as it provides the mathcoprocessor which the 486SX does not have.  Note that the speed ratings on theOverdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can run.  If you have a20MHz 486SX, then the Overdrive chip will run at 20/40MHz, ie. 20MHz externallyand 40MHz internally.  There is no reason to buy an Overdrive chip which israted at faster then your machine, you will not get faster performance.You should be able to buy these chips from any of the microchip merchants thatadvertise at the back of PC Magazine or PC Week.  You might want to shoparound as prices do vary.  If you need a name/phone number for a source fora particular chip, e-mail me, and I will respond with a couple of sources.Lawrence Khoo-- khoo@husc3.harvard.edu       Lawrence Khoo       Computer Consultantkhoo@haavelmo.harvard.edu    (617) 496-8992    Econ.

 37Nntp-Posting-Host: mipgsun.mipg.upenn.eduI am trying to get my system to work with a Tandberg 3600 + FutureDomain TMC-1660 + Seagate ST-21M MFM controller. The system boots up if the Tandberg is disconnected from the system,and of course no SCSI devices found (I have no other SCSI devices).The system boots up if the Seagate MFM controller is removed from thesystem. The Future Domain card reports finding the Tandberg 3660 onthe SCSI bus. The system then of course stops booting because my MFMhard disks can't be found.The system hangs if all three (Tandberg, Future Domain TMC-1660 &Seagate MFM controller) are in the system. Looks like there is some conflict between the Seagate and FutureDomain card. But the funny thing is that it only hangs if the Tandbergis connected.I have checked that there are no conflict in BIOS addresses, IRQ & I/Oport. Have I missed anything?I am lost here. Any suggestions are most welcomed.

 24I have a 486 sx 25 and I recently added a SCSI drive to my system using an  Adaptec 1522 (non busmastering) controller. Yesterday I ran coretest to  find out drive performance and these are the values I gotSeagate 106 Meg: 875.1kb/Sec14.5ms avg seek   3.7ms track to track Quantum 400 Meg SCSI: 991.2 Kb/sec  12.7 avg seek 3.6 track to track.First off all are these good results? I don't know what typical values  are.What I'm wondering now is the following. My swap file is currently on the  IDE. I could move it to the SCSI which is 13% faster, but then I would not  be able to use 32-bit access which might actuall make it slower. So on  which drive should I put my swap file to get best results? Is there a swap  file speed test program out there?Finally, I also ran the above tests with the ASPI2DOS driver loaded and I  got no difference whatsoever in performance. Is there any reason at all  why I should load this driver?Thanks in advance, I will post a summary if I get enough responses.-Eric

I can tell you that mixing them between 'banks' ok, and I can't see why mixing in one bank is not unless they are of different speeds ( e.g. mixing of 60ns and 100ns SIMMs in one bank ).  The two only differ in the type of chips it uses.  Assuming that the SIMMS are 1Mx9 ( 9 bit wide ), here is the two equivalent configuration.  The 3-chip SIMM uses two 4-bit wide 4Mbit (1M of 4-bit nibbles ) and one 1-bit wide 1Mbit chip ( for a total of 9-bit wide 1Mbyte ).  The 9-bit SIMM uses nine 1-bit wide 1Mbit chips.  These are equivalent because of the way that it is 'pinned' on the SIMM board.  At the SIMM interface, they both act as 9-bit wide 1MByte SIMMS ( 2*4+1=9*1 ).  [sorry if too techie for ya].MG>> Similarly, one cannot plug in two 1MB SIMMs and one 4MB SIMMs to giMG>> the system a total of 6 MEG. Why is that so ?? If my system supportsMG>> of 8 MEG (it has 8 SIMM slots), can I plug in 4 4MB SIMMs to give myMG>> 16MB ??That sounds correct.  the problem is that if your computer takes 9-bit wide SIMMs, you can not mix different sizes in one bank.  Why you ask?  Simple,  if you understand why there is banks.  Assuming you have a 32-bit CPU ( 386DX or 486 ), the data bus (e.g. the mechanism to retrieve data from memory ) is 32-bits wide, so the computer expects to see 32 bits when it asks for data.  To get that bandwidth ( 32-bit wide ), the motherboard links 4 1Mx9 ( one bit is not data, but parity, so I will ignore that in this simple explaination ) to get 32bits [ (9-1)*4=32 bits ].  That means that a SIMM in a bank stores only 1/4 of the 32 bit wide data.  If you have a 16-bit bus, two 1Mx9 SIMMs are linked together to get 16-bit wide data, which is the reason why 286 banks are 2 SIMMs wide, and 32-bit banks are 4 SIMMs wide.  If your computer required 1Mx36 ( e.g. 32-bit wide data with 4 parity bits, used in some PS/2s and ASTs ), you could upgrade by one SIMM at a time.Hope that this message is not over your head, but the answer to your question was not simple.

[for MDs]>>By giving the 2.5"MO a floppy interface it could reduce the price of it and>make it easily installed in existing devices.This question is, to me, like asking "Why use SCSI at all?"- Due to the rather primitive standard DMA solution (which is used by almost all  floppy interfaces) of PCs, the speed is limited to approx 500 Kbytes/s.   I want a standard allowing higher performance.- With SCSI, the OS can issue a request to the disk and then go ahead with other  things. Later, when the controller has performed the search and physical read,  data can be transferred to main memory at "RAM speeds". Not very relevant with  MS-DOS, but MS-DOS is not made for the future.- I've *got* a SCSI interface. I've got a 5.25" and a 3.5" floppy, too, and I am  not going to throw them out. With SCSI I may add, for all practical purposes,  an "unlimited" number of disk units without sacrificing any of my old disks. - For my PC, I've got a 300 Mbyte SCSI disk adopted from a SUN machine, and I  can carry it over to a Mac, a Sparcstation, an Alpha machine... whatever I like  to, if I decide to turn my back to the PC. (I *do* know that I cannot expect  to move the data without reformatting!)There are probably numerous other reasons for SCSI as well.>After all it is a floppy replacement we are taking about. 128Mb isnt all that>much, so it isnt going to replace the need of a fast fixed disk.No, not replace, but supplement. And contrary to a floppy, a MD may be fast enoughto run programs (or access data) directly off the MD. So we'll have much higherexpectations/demands, which is much better supported by SCSI than the old floppyinterface. And the price of SCSI controllers is not that high any more - isn't itsomething like a dozen large pizzas, nowadays? :-)ka.

 44Message-ID: <1qn627$iv@darwin.sura.net>NNTP-Posting-Host: azathoth.sura.netRecently my cousin got a second internal IDE drive (a Seagate 210MB,I can look up the model number if it's important) and I've beentrying to help him install it.  [I've got a vested interest, sincemy machine's busted and I have to use his until I get mine fixed.]He already has a Seagate 85MB IDE HD (again, I forget the model numberbut I can find out.)Anyway, I can't seem to get the bloody thing up.  I've managed to getone or the other drive up (with the other disconnected), but not bothat the same time; whenever I try, the thing hangs during bootup -never gets past the system test.  The IDE controller's instructionsheet says it supports two drives; I think I've configured the CMOScorrectly; the power's plugged in properly; I even learned about themaster/slave relationship that two HDs are supposed to have (didn'tknow PCs were into S&M! 8^) and I think I configured the jumpersproperly (the 85MB one is the master, the new 210MB one is the slave).The only thing I can think of is maybe I'm doing the cabling wrong.  I'vetried several combinations:controller - master - slavecontroller - slave - mastermaster - controller - slaveNone of them worked.  Unfortunately, I can't think of any others.Another possibility is that the 85MB one is already partitioned intotwo seperate drives, C and D, and the CMOS asks for "C: drive" and "D:drive" setup info rather than "drive 1" and "drive 2" like most othersI've seen.  Could this be confusing things?So, I need HELP!  The drive came bereft of any docs, except for someinfo for the CMOS setup; the controller has a little piece of paperabout the size of an index card; I cannibalized the cable (it's oneof those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle, soit looks like a serial connection); now I be lost!Many, many thanks in advance!

 98Hi Netters,As promised, here are the summary of opinions on DoubleDisk Gold v.6.0.People seem to be quite happy with the product. There is no much ofopinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader Stacker 3.0.(Superstor Pro is not considered since it is slower than Stacker althoughjust as reliable - BYTE Magazine's conclusion ;-) ), so it's hard to makeany decision to go with Stacker or with DoubleDisk Gold v6.0. However, it seems that at $39.95, it is quite a buy.Buddy Christyonobuddy@optics.ece.wisc.edu-------------------------------------------------------------------------summary of replies-------------------------------------------------------------------------Hello Buddy,I do not have DD Gold 6.0 experience.  I just ordered it.  I currently haveDD 2.3 (the last version).  I am very pleased with its performance.Here is my suggestion...1)  If you do not have any compression software currently, I would go withDOS 6.0's compression.  All the discussion on the net indicates thatfor $50 you get the compression (built into the OS), plus the otherutilities that you would pay way more than $50 for.  Besides, you are now at DOS6.0 (whatever that means...)2)  If you have DoubleDisk 2.3 already (like I do), the cost is $29.95for the upgrade.  After thinking about it and asking the net, Idecided that I could not go wrong with the update cost!I have never suffered from performance of DD.  I have a 12ms HD withlarge SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format.  Itworks great.  Not delays.  I think the "A" is better than "B" arguements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance.I am looking forward to being able to "LOADHIGH" the DD sw.  Thathas been an annoyance.3)  If you have Stacker, et.al. currently, I would not see it worth theeffort to upgrade.Just my $.02 ...Regards,Mark Bagdy----------------------------------------------------------------Buddy,I got the same mailer. About 2 weeks ago I got DDG and installed it. Thedocumentation was, in my opinion, easy to follow. I used the automaticinstallation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly.There were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max& QEMM. DDG has an uninstall (unlike DOS6.0) if you need it. My system has a203Mb hard drive. before installing DDG I had ~5Mb free. After DDG I had~197Mb free. Pretty good statistics considering that my 8Mb permanent windowsswap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers andsuch).I have had no problems whatsoever. I have noticed no slowdown (other than ittakes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. So far I am a veryhappy camper.-Bruce--   Bruce F.

It was very easy to install.The only problem I had was with Castle Wolfenstein 3-D.  I assumed the gamewas trying to bypass DOS disk access and moved the game to the non-compressedregion of the disk.  Since then the game has never given me a problem. There was never any damage to the DoubleDisk drive.Compression performance for the whole disk has held steady around 1.8:1.  This is lower than expected but about 20% (size) of my files are compressed image files and some large zip files.

 15I have a 486DX33 ISA system with 4 meg.  I am using a Diamond Speedstar HiColorvideo card with 1 meg VRAM and a standard CTX 14-in SVGA monitor.  When I amrunning Windows, and I have overlapping windows (say an application overlappingthe program manager window), and I close the active application, window erasureis very slow.  The part of the window that is not overlapping is erased first,very slowly.  This also happens when I iconify an application.The HiColor card is advertised as a faster-than-standard video card, but itdoes not have an accelerator chip on it.  I am running at 800x600x32k.  Is thisslow speed simply to be expected without an accelerator chip, or is theresomething else that is bottlenecking the system that I am unaware of?Thanks.(You can mail to me directly if you wish, at genek@cs.ucsb.edu).

 25Hi.  Recently my svga monitor has been acting up by taking about3 minutes to warm up.  Previously, when I first start up my PC I can see all the CMOS messages (RAM test ...etc) but now I've got to wait for about 3min before the display shows anything andit starts up with a bright white flash.  This only happenswhen the system has been off for a long time (eg overnight).If it was only off for a couple of hours and then turned onagain, the display works as normal like before.Does anyone know what is causing this?  Is it a warning thatit will give up soon or just signs of aging (the system is a386sx and its about 3 yrs old).  I've used systems at work foryears and never seen this happen to a monitor yet.I'd really appreciated any help that you fellow netters can offer.Thanks a lot.Edwin-- -----------------------------------------------------* Edwin Ng (edwin@ccu1.aukuni.ac.nz)                ** E&E Engineering, University of Auckland           ** Private Bag 92019, Auckland, NEW ZEALAND          *

Based on the comments of others you might want to view the 3FGX vs the 4 series on a PC running windows at 1024x768.  The refresh rate appears ok for me, but you might feel differently.

 20> My solution was to switch the interrupt to IRQ 5, which is> unreserved in contemporary computers (using IRQ 5 for the> drives went out with the XT architechture ... )Not completly true.  For AT class and later machines, IRQ5 isreserved for LPT2.  Since it's rare to have a second parallelport in a PC, it's usually a good safe choice if you need aninterrupt.On the other hand, we just ran into a problem with that hereat work on a Gateway computer (4DX-33V).  It has a Modem on COM1,a Mouse on COM2, and the other serial port was set to COM3 (whichnormally uses the same interrupt as COM1).  We had a real fightwith a board when trying to use IRQ5, and discoverd the problemwas that Gateway had set it up such that COM3 used IRQ5.  As soonas we disabled COM3, our problems went away.  Grumble ... afterseveral days of trying to figure out why the interrupt didn't work.~ Mike  (sprague.wbst311@xerox.com)

 12Hi, all hardware netters,  I've seen recently on some magazines advertising a ?NEW? Tridentgraphics card call 8900CL. The ad said it's new and *faster*. How is itcompare to Tseng ET4000? BTW, which is the fastest *non-accelerated* SVGAon the market? Any info or benchmark are welcome. Thanks in advance.regards,Desmond LiLUT, UK.

The >battery is soldered to the bord, an all three machines is still under >guarentee so if that would have help we can't remove the batteries.As far as I know, there is no way to get around the BIOS password except by shorting out the power supply to the CMOS memory, thereby erasing it. This will remove the password, but it will also destroy all the previous BIOS settings, so then you'll have to go and set them all up again. On my 386, there is a jumper on the motherboard which is provided for the purpose of shorting the battery. You just short this jumper briefly, and it interrupts power to the CMOS long enough to erase it. I would imagine there is something like this on your board too. In the future, I would suggest that YOU set the password, and leave it on "Setup" only. That way, no-one else can go and reset it or set it to "Always" unless they know what password you used. They had to do this over here too when they got a bunch of new 386's, for just the same reason.-Dale /~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\|      DALE M.

I guess I might believe anything.>>Whats the scoop on this standalone "drive activity" every 20 sec?I can only comment on thermal recalibration in general. Some newdrives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of datawrites. Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to performa test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physicaltolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some*track drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. Thisbecomes especially critical at very high recording densities, andso was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but itseems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way ofboosting the drive's long-term reliability and MTBF ratings.I first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointedout that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times whendigitizing, say, audio or video to hard disk. Some manufacturersexplicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are NOTto be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes.Hope this helps.Victor

 33Today I recieved a in-warranty replacement for myDiamond Speedstar 24X.  On the card I've noticed a fewchanges; mostly there is a new jumper labeled JP5.(The card is revision 5A)My detective work has shown that this jumper simplyconnects/disconnects the BALE line on the 64-pin partof the ISA bus.The question I have is simple:To those people who own this revision of the Speedstar 24X,what does the manual claim that this jumper does?To anyone with an ISA-reference, what is the function of theBALE line?On a related note:Are there any FTP sites which contain a descriptive reference tothe ISA bus?  My motherboard manual has a simple pin-to-signal-namechart, but that is it.-Douglas_________________________________________________________ ________   ___    ___  |_   __  \\ |   |  |   |   Douglas R.

 37        I'm buying a new system this week to replace my brain dead 286, andcould use some feedback on a couple systems I'm looking at if anyone isfamiliar with them.         The system that looks the most interesting is the Budget 486/66 VLBtower.  For about $2343 (delivered) it offers VLB, 8MB, 200MB IDE, a MitsumiCD-ROM (with software bundle), Media Vision Sound board, 14" CTX 1468NI,128K Cache, and the usual drives, ports, & OS software.  Since my budget is$2350 for a system, it seems almost too good to be true (which may mean itIS too good to be true, of course). Among other things, I've never seen areview of the Budget systems (or their parent company, Micro Smart), or ofthe motherboard they are using (the Aetana). Any feedback would beappreciated.         In a similar vein, the second system I'm considering Midwest Micro'sElite VESA 486/66 tower with a Diamond Viper (2MB) & Midwest Micro 14" MImonitor is one I've never seen reviewed anywhere.  I'm familiar with thefirm but not the product line - and some idea of their quality would be abigbenefit here as well.         Any other suggestions in the price range would be appreciated - mygreatest needs are speed and graphics capabilities. Email response would be greatly appreciated.Thanks,--                        -=*=- -=*=- -=*=- -=*=- -=*=-            The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised      over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to      prevent harm to others.

 21Hello,I already tried our national news group without success.I tried to replace a friend's original IBM floppy disk in his PS/1-PCwith a normal TEAC drive.I already identified the power supply on pins 3 (5V) and 6 (12V), shortedpin 6 (5.25"/3.5" switch) and inserted pullup resistors (2K2) on pins8, 26, 28, 30, and 34.The computer doesn't complain about a missing FD, but the FD's lightstays on all the time. The drive spins up o.k. when I insert a disk,but I can't access it.The TEAC works fine in a normal PC.Are there any points I missed?Thank you.Volkmar---Volkmar.Grote@Stollmann.DE

There is a limitation/bug in the date roll-over software inPC's that means you have to be doing something like waiting for keyboard inputvia a DOS call rather than a BIOS call (as menus often use) otherwise the codeto update the date after midnight never gets called. Somebody might be able to correct the details in case I've mis-rememberredthem, but I think you have to change the menu program (if you have the sources)or add a TSR or system patch or something.  As far as I know the CMOS clockkeeps the right time (in fact about 7 seconds/day better than DOS's clock).Mark Aitchison, University of Canterbury.

 30Hello, I've been following discussions on 17" monitors in comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware and noted that the Nanao seems to get very goodreviews.  I'm interested in getting more information about Nanao's productsas well as some others that may fit the bill.   I would like a monitor that can handle high resolutions like 1024x1024 NI.I'm envisioning using this monitor on an Amiga 4000 or Amiga 2000 w/a graphicsboard like the Retina, and/or on a Sun like the SPARCstation LX.  BasicallyI want a high resolution versital monitor.  This monitor need not be large(=>17") if it meets the brief requirements as outlined above.  I've beenvery happy with a 16" on Suns and could probably cope with smaller at home.I'm interested if anyone has more details on high quality Sony and Hitatchimonitors since they seem to be used on Sun's fairly often and look prettygood (to me at least).  I haven't seem them brought up in c.s.i.p.h veryoften as are Mag and Viewsonic.Ok, stuff I'd like to find out:  How can I get ahold of Nanao?  What arethe products in their line?  What are the technical specs?  Esp. whatscan freq and max resolutions can they handle?  What's list and streetcost - if avail. from a third party, and where can I get ahold of them? Same info for Sony and Hitatchi.Thank you very much!! --  ,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`, ,`,`John Navitsky`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`johnn@eskimo.com,`,`,`, ,`,`Exercise a right today,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`, ,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,
 190Below is the list of large (at least 18 inches diagonal) monochromemonitors which Computer Shopper lists as PC compatible.  I've omittedRadius because Radius states that they no longer support the PC.You will notice that Nanao is the only one which supports a 31.5Khzhorizontal frequency, which is the frequency normally used by VGA cardsat boot up.  My guess is that all the other monitors come with theirown graphics cards.  I've left voice mail with Nanao asking them tosend me some literature, and will report back to the net after I'vestudied it.The prices given appear to be list prices and have little relationshipto reality.Kenneth Almquist--------------------------------- cut here ---------------------------------Cornerstone Technology1990 Concourse Dr.San Jose, CA 95131408-435-8900  DualPage 120:    Diagonal:        19 inches    Max Resolution:  1600x1280    Frequencies:     105Khz horizontal, 76Hz vertical    Dimensions:      19x18x17 inches    Price:           $1495    Compatible with: PC;PS/2  DualPage 150:    Diagonal:        19 inches    Max Resolution:  2048x1538    Frequencies:     105Khz horizontal, 67Hz vertical    Dimensions:      19x18x17 inches    Price:           $1595    Compatible with: PC;PS/2Ikegami Electronics (U.S.A.), Inc.37 Brook Ave.Maywood, NJ 07670201-368-9171  DM-2010AD:    Diagonal:        20 inches    Max Resolution:  1280x1024    Frequencies:     48-64Khz horizontal, 59-80Hz vertical    Price:           $995    Compatible with: PCImage Systems Corp.11595 K-TelHopkins, NM 55343800-462-4370 or 612-935-1171  M21LMAX:    Diagonal:        21 inches    Max Resolution:  2048x1536    Frequencies:     48-108Khz horizontal, 60-80Hz vertical    Dimensions:      17x20x19 inches    Price:           $1995    Compatible with: PC;PS/2;Mac  M21LV-65MAX:    Diagonal:        21 inches    Max Resolution:  1280x1024    Frequencies:     15-65Khz horizontal, 55-90Hz vertical    Price:           $4695    Compatible with: PC;PS/2;Mac  M21PMAX :    Diagonal:        21 inches    Max Resolution:  1280x1664    Frequencies:     48-108Khz horizontal, 60-80Hz vertical    Dimensions:      19x15x17 inches    Price:           $2500    Compatible with: PC;PS/2;Mac  M24PMAX :    Diagonal:        24 inches    Max Resolution:  1280x1664    Frequencies:     48-108Khz horizontal, 60-80Hz vertical    Dimensions:      22x18x18 inches    Price:           $2600    Compatible with: PC;PS/2;MacNanao USA Corp.23535 Telo Ave.Torrence, CA 90505310-325-5202  FlexScan 6500:    Diagonal:        21 inches    Max Resolution:  1664x1200    Frequencies:     31.5;56-80Khz horizontal, 55-90Hz vertical    Dimensions:      18x20x17 inches    Price:           $1989    Compatible with: PC;PS/2;MacRan-Ger Technologies, Inc.[Address unknown]  The Genuis Model 1920M:    Diagonal:        19 inches    Max Resolution:  1280x1024    Frequencies:     64Khz horizontal, 60Hz vertical    Dimensions:      17x19x17 inches    Price:           $950    Compatible with: PCSampo Corp. of AmericaP.

 9I have a Standard Computer 486DX2/66mhz EISA Tower with 16MB RAM, a Quantum 240MB Hard Drive, 1.2 and 1.44 MB floppies and a Colorado 250MB tape drive. I also have a Sound Blaster Pro and a 3COM Ethernet card (3C507) installed. The machine is completely stable in non-Turbo mode. In Turbo mode, Windows for Workgroups crashes or won't come up at all. If Windows does come up, I get General Protection Faults and Divide by Zero System Errors. Is there a problem with memory keeping up with the speed of the CPU on these machines?I have tried to reach Standard Computers, but their phones have been disconnected.Does anyone know what happened to this company?YAMOHS- Yet Another Mail Order Horror Story!I'd prefer e-mailed responses as I don't get to read this newsgroup often.

 77Sender: Mike J. BellDistribution: worldMessage-ID: <1qresvINN34i@elana01.acslab.umbc.edu>NNTP-Posting-Host: elana01.acslab.umbc.eduSummary: 486 box with NEXTSTEPFirst of all:  Thank you everyone who replied.  As you can wellimagine, I got nearly one hundred responses, so I figured I'd thankyou all here instead of individually.The tallies:I got one vote for A/UX, which runs on the Macintosh.I got several nays for Commodore's 3000UX system.Most people agreed that SGI's were nice, and very very expensive.Some (devoted) Sun users nearly insisted that I try to find a usedSun, say a 3/60 or 3/80.About a dozen people told me how they love their NeXT...only now NeXTis out of the hardware business (see below).And most of the other 85+ people said:  Get a 486 box, and run someversion of Unix that's available either in the Public Domain orcommercially.=============And so I weighed my options.  What stood out, in my opinion, was thatthere were several different versions of Unix available on one system:the 486 (PC) architecture.  If I bought a Sun, I'd have to use SunOS.If I bought a (used) NeXT, I'd have to use NeXTSTEP (see below).  Adnauseum.But with a PC, I can run Linux, which is a small user-friendly (?)flavor that uses shared libraries to cut down on volume, although Ihear its networking abilities aren't up to speed with 386bsd, anotherPD (==free) port (which takes up a lot more space).  I can purchaseBSD386 (commercial product) if I choose.  There are several othercommercial packages available.So, what I've found out (after pricing systems, etc.), is that I canget a really good Unix workstation for as little as ~$2500.  Includingsource code!Or, for ~$3500-4000, I can get an unbelievable EISA bus 486-66DX2system, fully blown, and run single user BSD386.What I'm really excited about, though, is NEXTSTEP for Intel.  NeXTchanged into a software company only, and they are releasing their OSfor PC's.  I've used NeXT's before, and I absolutely loved them.Everyone who wrote me about NeXT (or NEXTSTEP) commented on thedeveloper's environment, and how well designed the whole package is.===========So, my choice is to:1)  Wait for the mail on Monday, so I can read what NEXTSTEP's systemrequirements are2)  If I'm wowed on what they say, I'll buy a system that fits intotheir criteria    2a)  Get NEXTSTEP3)  If I'm wowed, but I can't afford it yet (most likely), I'll buy asystem that fits their criteria    3a)  Get Linux or 386bsd, as a temporary learning experience so Ican save up for NEXTSTEP4)  If I'm not sufficiently wowed (least likely), I'll buy a systemthat is slightly less blown out (like a 486DX 25, ISA) and put Linuxor 386bsd on it.================Again, thanks to everyone around the net.

The first attempt failed in the summerof 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31, 1992).  The voting rulesstate that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be startedafter a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993).This is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia andcomp.os.os2.bugs.This document contains:*  the background showing the need for these proposals*  the proposed charters for these proposals*  voting instructions*  a voting ballot*  some example ballots*  the voting rules*  the voting schedule*  the Mass AcknowledgementBackground:The creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2and emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurreda continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, suchas emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, andmuch more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x,allowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.Much of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, andlater, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, thenumber of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibilitywith their hardware increases, as does the questions on theavailability of drivers for their hardware, installationprocedures, etc.Multimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports WindowsMultimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM isincluding direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).Any non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.So far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks(e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, orfor free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- readcomp.os.os2.misc for details).Proposed Charters:(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)It will provide a forum for developers of ported software soas to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, andspur additional development.  The group will also covertopics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,Windows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in programportability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), andso forth.(b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)To keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchyorthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed tocomp.os.os2.programmer.misc.comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroupfor OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues andtechnical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.(c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)It will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including theavailability of device drivers, compatibility information,installation procedures, system requirements, and overallperformance optimization.(d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)It will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.(e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)It will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bugdiagnosis and work arounds, the availability of systempatches and corrective service disks, and so forth.[Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in othernewsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong incomp.os.os2.beta]How to Vote:To cast your vote, fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me.Many newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to thispost.

If you vote more than once, only the most  recent vote will be counted.* Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  Proxy voting,  forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted.* Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings  will be revealed only after the poll closes.* I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will  post the ACK twice (see Schedule below).* If you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how  voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site.

In other words, a proposal passes if:      YES - NO >= max (100, NO)  where max() returns the highest number given to it.Schedule:The voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was postedby David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).This third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV, but it also has theMass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those whohave already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.

 31It depends on what you'd like your joystick for.  I've seen Gravisjoysticks at Radio Shack.  They seemed flimsy and didn't fit well in myhand.  I have heard on c.s.i.p.games that they don't last well (less thana year) on flightsims.  One redeeming feature does seem to be the abilityto adjust the tension of the stick.I recently purchased a CH Flightstick.  There aren't any suction cups andno tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick. I'm currently using it for the Wing Commander series and Red Baron.  Worksquite well.  The large base does not require a steadying hand and soleaves it free.  The buttons provide good tactile response (you can hearand feel them well).  There are other models made by CH that can go up ordown in features.For price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for ~$35.00 herecompared to the $45.00 I paid for a CH Flightstick.  I think the extra$10.00 is worth it just in feel.  Best thing to do is to ask a salespersonto let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy.Just another note, analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or somethingthat needs sensitive touch.  If you're only playing games such as CastleWolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input (ie. only up,down, left, etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look intoa Gravis gamepad.  They look like a Nintendo control pad but I don't knowmuch beyond that.--      Will Christie       |    AATCHOO!      | PHILOSOPHY: the principles and  University of Manitoba  |    Uh-oh...      |  science of thought and reality  Winnipeg, MB, Canada   |   I'm leaking    | PHILOSOPHER: someone who thinkschrstie@ccu.UManitoba.CA | brain lubricant. |  they're useful to society
 79I just purchased a Viewsonic 17 and and Orchid P9000.  In short, I am happywith the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more timefutzing with the card, so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitoris pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17" Magnavox went away.  Itisn't as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs, I think).  So much for themonitor.  On to the bitch session and test results.In going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colorsin 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS programwhich uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA,Orchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Thoseare all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 usesa Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them).  The Hercules Graphitecard does seem to have these modes, but I didn't run the same test cases asI did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able toprint the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia, though, which the S3cards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.The supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz ifyou tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitorslisted plus 'Generic', and if you choose Generic you can't get any highrefreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to methat the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hzat 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolutionwas the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have,and it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well.The higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phonewith Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don't know what I have) he was unableto recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful ashe could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't havethe problem.  He didn't know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either.The board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the HerculesSpeedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the resultsin pixels/second.  I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card, but theywere close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz386, ISA, so the numbers aren't really comparable.  The following numberswere all obtained using a 486, 33 MHz, AIR motherboard (UMC chipset), with8 MB memory.  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as itcomputes them, and these tend to jump around a bit.K means thousand (not 1024), M means million, pixels per second             Orchid Fahrenheit VLB                  Orchid P9000Chip                 S3 805                          Weitek 9000DIB to Screen        182K - 190K                     228K - 240KMemory to Screen     5.9M - 6.2M                     8.4M - 8.9MScreen to Screen     14M - 14.8M                     29M - 30.8MVector, solid        2.4M                            2.8M - 2.9MVector, styled       55K - 58K                       449K - 473KPolygon, shaded      1.8M - 2.1M                     1.6M - 1.9MPolygon, hatched     6.9M - 7.9M                     1.3M - 1.7MTernary Rops         1.9M - 2.4M                     477K - 520KFont                 130K - 160K                     46K - 55K / 1.2MThe DIB to Screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfersit to the screen.  I have no idea what is being done internally as far asconversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it tothe screen, my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that canjust be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies thatface from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly, the solidvectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie,filled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.  Graphicsoperations like XORs maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000.  I give twonumbers for the 9000 fonts, because I think they are caching.When the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly --1/3 the speed of the OFVLB.  Then the speed increases dramatically.  Soundslike programming to a benchmark to me....I make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.  Its just whatI saw when I ran them on my computer.  I normally don't write disclaimers,but this time maybe I'd better.  My testing is totally unconnected with mywork (I program under UNIX on Decstations) is done completely without theknowledge, blessing, or equipment of my company.geoff sherwood

 28I recently bought an AMD 386/40.  The motherboard booklet saysthe board is a "391 WB/H."  I have 4 1x3 simms on board.  The machinealso uses a Super IDE I/O Card (model PT-604). (of course nietherthe motherboard or the I/O card booklet clearly state who the manufacurersare) I'm also using a Trident 8900C SVGA card.Anyway, that's all of the pertinent info I can think of.My problem is that the computer often freezes or displays "Parity Error --System Halted" messages depending on whether I set the Memory Parity ErrorChecking to "disabled" or "enabled" in the setup of the bios (makes sense).Its AMI bios (so it must be an AMI board?).I just took it back to the dealer and they replaced all of theSIMMS but I keep getting the same error (more frequently now).  It allworked at the dealer and didn't start screwing up 'till I got home (figures).I've tried to take out all of the SIMMS and even re-inserted themin reverse order, making sure that the connections were solid.My suspicion jumps to this damn all in one HD controller/serial/parallel/game-port I/O card, or to the motherboard (God forbid).CAN ANYONE HELP?Thanks, Peace,David Gellergelldav@elof.acc.iit.edu

 53FOR SALE:AT&T Dataport Internal 14.4K Fax/ModemThe modem is an internal AT/(E)ISA 8-bit card (just a little longerthan a half-card).  It has v.32bis for 14.4Kbps data / 9600 bps fax,v.42, v.42bis, and MNP5 for error-correction and data compression, soyou can get error-free links up to 57,600 bps on a conventional phoneline.  They will "fall back" to any speed (down to 1200bps) and evendisable compression and error-correction if necessary in order toconnect with slower and older modems.It has a 16550 buffered UART for better compatibility withmulti-tasking operating systems (Windows, OS/2, Unix, etc).They use a patented technology called Optical Line Interface (OLI)which reduces noise generated by the modem to assure the fastest andcleanest connection possible.These modems come with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime techsupport (and the call is free, too) from AT&T.They also include the lovely and talented QuickLink II for DOS and theNEW QuickLink II for Windows communications and fax software whichwill let you conveniently sent faxes from any DOS or Windowsapplication just by printing.  The Windows version will send faxes ofany font and can include graphics, etc.  The DOS version can faxgraphics and a limited set of fonts (I believe that there are 5 or so,as well as any HP Laser II resident fonts).I'm asking $210.00 for this modem (plus Utah tax).  This is at orbelow the prices of any other (reputable) manufacturer of anequivalent modem (including Zoom, US Robotics, etc).  And, it isbacked by a company that will never go away.This price will include delivery if you live within 20 miles ofdowntown SLC.  I can also arrange shipping, or you can stop by my hometo pick it up.  (If you're concerned about installing an internalmodem, let me know and we can discuss an arrangement for includinginstallation.)If you're interested, please let me know.  This is an excellent modemat an excellent price (they normally list for ~$500 and retail forabout ~$300).  I installed one of these last week and it is very nice.If you have questions about this, AT&T has an info number at (800) 554-4996, or you can email me and I will attemp to answer them.The modem will go to the highest bidder I get within the next week.Thanks.

When trying to format it (*no* low-levelformat, just FDISK and DOS FORMAT), I somehow messed up theparameters... I had entered FDISK /MBR not exactly knowingwhat this does.The suggested drive type 38 formats the drive only to 21MB.I tried type 25, but this gives only around 70MB and notthe nominal 80MB.Could I use user type 47?

I also know the "local service" scam that retail computer dealers liketo push when they're selling.  It's that same old song that car dealershaving been singing for years -- "Buy from me and you'll get goodservice. We always treat our customers right!  Buy from my competitionand you'll be sorry if you need service." Experienced mail order buyers know that there are some mail ordercompanies that give excellent service, including overnight replacement parts, on-site calls, etc. There are probably some local dealers that can give yougood service, too. But if you think all local dealers give consistenly good service, you are wrong.

 12The temp on my 486DX2/66 is over 96C (measured with a K-type thermocouple and Fluke 55 dig thermometer).  This is an "idle" temp - not doing lots ofbus i/o, not doing floating point, not doing 32-bit protected mode etc.  Thisis in a Micron computer, without heatsink.I recently put a heatsink/fan on the chip, but I might take the fan off.

(Actually, it already is running, it's just not getting allthe info I want it to yet...)  Anyway, I want to check for a mouse.  Ialready check for a mouse driver (using the code in Microsoft's Mousebook).  But there is no guarantee that the driver is loaded when myprogram runs, or that they ever load the driver.  Since I am interested in what hardware is attached to the machine, howdo I detect is a mouse is attached?  I know it can be done because themouse driver can do it.

I'vebeen calling around the local stores and everyone appearsto be only stocking the 386DX/33/40 or 386SX/25/33 motherboards.How difficult is it to modify a 386DX/40 motherboard to run at25 MHz?

 30>How do you do bus-mastering on the ISA bus?By initiating a DMA xfer.  :)Seriously, busmastering adapter have their own DMA ability, they don't usethe motherboards on-board DMA(which is *MUCH* slower).ISA has no bus arbitration, so if two busmastering cards in 1 ISA systemtry to do DMA xfers on the same DMA channel the system will lock or crash.(I forget)Their are 8 DMA channels in an ISA system. 0-7. 0-3 are 8-bit & 4-7 are16-bit.The system uses DMA 0, a SoundBlaster uses DMA 1.I could buy a busmastering XGA-2 video card & a busmastering SCSI HA.In order for them to work properly, I would have to find out what DMAchannel the XGA-2 card uses and then simply configure the SCSI HA touse a different DMA channel for its DMA xfers.I don't know if multiple DMA xfers can go on at the same time on ISA.I'm not sure if they can on EISA systems either.I do know that on EISA/MCA systems, you can allow BM cards to use thesame DMA channel.Thanks.

 25Quantum LPS240A hard disk phantom seeksI just purchased and installed a 240MB Quantum 3.5" hard drive, modelLPS240A, and have a concern about its behavior.Although the disk drive itself seems to behave properly with respect tofile I/O, it performs what I call phantom seeks.When the PC is absolutely idle, I can hear a spurt of activity in thedrive every 30-40 seconds, lasting 1-2 seconds. This activity seems tobe initiated strictly within the drive itself since the disk LED nevercomes on. [The disk LED is attached to the disk controller card, notthe drive.]My other hard disk, a Seagate ST3283A, does not have this kindbehavior.Can anyone comment on this strange phenomenon?-----------------------Steve Harroldswh@cup.hp.comHPG200/11(408) 447-5580---------------------

 14hello all- i have a problem with my micro solutions backpack- sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt.  i will either start a backup, or start a tape format, and at about 20 percent i get an error either sayingthe tape is bad or the backup/format has aborted for an unknown reason.if i turn everything off and wait a half hour it works fine.  is itbecause the tape backup is too warm?  has anyone had similar experiences?thanks,kevin

 24Howdy,Sorry if this has been covered before:One of my PC illiterate friends asked me to help him install DRDOS 6.0 on hisNEC Powermate SX (386SX 16).  Of course, I said "No problem" and went to work.Unfortunately, the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during installation, even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive usingthe old DOS.  After openning it up I discovered it was using an 8-bit Seagate SCSI controller on a ST-157N SCSI 40Mbtye drive.  I then booted with DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if I could access the drive.  Lo and behold the primary 46.5 Mbyte partition was intact (created by DOS 3.1 no less, I didn't think you could go over a32Mbyte partition in the older DOSes. I could be wrong...).  I then tried to remove the primary partition, which it wouldn't allow me to do.  I am unaware of anything special that has to be done with a SCSI drive (I kinda expected it to work just like an IDE/MFM/RLL drive for DOS installations).  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated (except for "Throw it in the garbage and buy a new PC")...Thanks in advance,Paul "Mr. SCSI... NOT!" Fincke

I can definitily say that you can use an RLL as Master and IDE as slave, asI have just upgraded my machine with a 200Mb IDE ( And custom ControllerMdl CI-1010 Extended IDE Controller ) While maintaining my RLL'd Wren asmaster Drive.  The trick is the controller which supports up to 4 IDE Driveswhile coexisting with existing Controllers ( MFM,RLL,ESDI,SCSI ).So according to the Documentation it should work with ESDI, and I can assureyou it works with RLL.Bruce Powellemail: bss_brucep@vd.seqeb.gov.au

I a single drive environment the drive is described as a Master.   In a dual drive environment the drives are described as a Master and aSlave. This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives when performing diagnostics.   There are four links, LK1, LK2, LK4 and LK5, adjacent to the 40 way interface connector. They have the following functions and are described in order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper described nearest the 40 way interface connector.LK2: LED      When fitted, this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the     interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An     external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with     the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will     be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130     Ohms ot 220 Ohms.LK1: Dual Drives     This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single     bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector,     indicating, to the Master drive, the presence of a Slave.LK4: Master     When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If     there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be     jumpered in this way.LK5: IOChRdy     When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive, it is      fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher     data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per     second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally      fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per     second.   There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s)may be jumpered:     Master, single drive with LED on interfaceLK2 & LK4 fitted.     Master, single drive without LED on interfaceLK4 only fitted.     Master, dual drive without LED on interfaceLK4 & LK1 fitted.     Slave, dual drive without LED on interfaceNo jumpers fitted.     Master, dual drive with LED on interfaceLK4, LK1 & LK2 fitted.     Slave, dual drive with LED on interfaceLK2 only fitted.   The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds toreduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used.   The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way connector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affectedby the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the drive for this LED driver.

 36Distribution: worldMessage-ID: <1qkv09INNn3s@senator-bedfellow.MIT.EDU>NNTP-Posting-Host: pesto.mit.eduHiI have an Orchid Fahrenheit VLB with 2MB of DRAM.  It is an S386c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing mysecond meg of DRAM for the video, and thanks to Orchid, I got a fixfrom their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in theordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered fromthem, so I guess I should be glad they didn't just say "Buy the memoryfrom us" or something like that.)The one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen orenlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MBof memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256.Just ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known, I wouldn't have bothered.  Iasked them why, and all I got was "Your point is well taken, butOrchid's software developers are busy with other projects."So, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I'd love toget another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the nextgeneration of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with mysystem and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they'rebroken.If you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805cards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB), at least until their developers are "lessbusy".  If the magazines are to believed, I've only seen one s3 86c805product thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?),although evenn that might be a misprint.Please, if there are generic or semi-generic drivers outthere, let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK, but Icoulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL.Thanks.donyee@athena.mit.edu

Rememberthose 21 Mb disks that look and feel like 3.5" floppies? These drivesare SCSI devices and can read and write both 720 Kb and 1.44/21 Mbdisks. Sounds to me to be one great product for the PC market. Are theprices really that unaffordable compared to CD-ROMs which are currentlynot rewritable? I know about the new rewritable CDs and expect SONY todevelop the first MDs for the computer. My question is: why isn't thereany substantial interest in developing the flopticals?Just a thought.Kin Chansparrow+@cmu.edu

 55Hi Netters!I'm looking at purchasing some sort of backup solution.  After you read aboutmy situation, I'd like your opinion.  Here's the scenario:1.  There are two computers in the house.  One is a small 286 (40MB IDE drive).    The other is a 386DX (213 SCSI drive w/ Adaptec 1522 controller).  Both     systems have PC TOOLS and will use Central Point Backup as the backup /     restore program.  Both systems have 3.5" and 5.25" floppies.2.  The computers are not networked (nor will they be anytime soon).From what I have seen so far, there appear to be at least 4 possiblesolutions (I'm sure there are others I haven't thought about).  For these options, I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has tried them or sees any flaws (drive type X won't coexist with device Y, etc.) in my thinking (I don't know very much about these beasts):1.  Put 2.88MB floppy drives (or a combination drive) on each system.    Can someone supply cost and brand information?  What's a good brand?    What do the floppies themselves cost?2.  Put an internal tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and    continue to back up the 286 with floppies.  Again, can someone recommend a    few manufacturers?  The only brand I remember is Colorado Memories.  Any    happy or unhappy users (I know about the compression controversy)? 3.  Connect an external tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and    (maybe?) connect it to the 286 somehow (any suggestions?)4.  Install a Floptical drive in each machine.  Again, any gotcha's or     recommendations for manufacturers?  I appreciate your help.  You may either post or send me e-mail.  I willsummarize all responses for the net.Thanks,George=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  George J.

 17They don't have a conflict because technically LPT1: does not useIRQ7!.     The Parallel printer processor (the actual number escapesme) contains a printer control register which enables the chipto transmit an interrupt to the interrupt controller as IRQ7,then onto the main processor as Int 0x0F. By default the parallelprinter processor does not enable it's interrupt line thereforeno Int 0x0F's will be sourced from the printer controller chip,thus enabling other devices to use the actual IRQ7.     Note, this applies to COM ports also which by default do notroute interrupts to the system bus, although COM's softwareusually enable this feature as it make monitoring COM portactivity easier than polling the serial UART, thus probablygetting the sound card slighty confused!.Windows may be a different story....
 47The last time I was in microprocessor lab was in 1980, using Z-80.So I don't know a lot of buzz terms in PC hardware.Now I need to purchase a 486, help me to ask the right questions.Motherboard:    I need 486-33 with 8 MB ram, with additonal slot for 8 more MB.    I would like to get two VESA Local Bus. One for video, not sure    what am I going to do with the other.     It must be able to run Unix.        What are other questions that I should ask to ensure getting a    quality stuff? What are other important features ?Monitor:    I want a 14" non interlaced svga, but not sure about what brand    to get. I can't afford NEC or SONY. What brands should I consider?    Acer? Touch?    What else should I ask?Video Card:     I would like to run Framemaker. So I need a fast video card. Is Western    Digital worth the $20 over Cirrus Logic?  Do I need more than 1M of     V-RAM?    One company wanted $50 more for a local bus video card. Is this normal?    Hard Drive:    Segate, Western Digital, Conner all have the same price. Which one is    more liable? which one has better performace?Case/power supply:    Given the choise of desktop and minitower, which one is better?    What is the adequate power supply?    Is cooling a general problem or a non-issue?    What features should I ask for?    Did I miss anything?I am sure that there are a lot of semi-PC-literates reading this group.Your help is greatly appreciated.Jason Chen

 28X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL9]A couple of months ago I tried out a Hercules Graphite card.  A pretty niceboard.  Fairly fast, and seemed quite compatible -- even seemed to handle theSVGA modes I have whined about here on occasion.  At the time I was justbuying a VLB system, so after checking out the card I sent it back.  I wanteda VLB card, and purchased a Fahrenheit VLB card.  This card is fairly fast,will do 70 Hz refresh at 1024x768, but is not compatible with my CD-ROMS(the SVGA thing -- I think; I have merely conjectured that is the cause ofan old graphics board being able to run in a higher resolution with thoseprograms than the modern boards I have tried.  I have not gotten a straightanswer out of anybody...).  The monitor I am using it with is a 17" Magnavox,which also tops out at 1024x768x70 Hz so its really a pretty good match.But...That is for my wife.  I just purchased a Viewsonic 17 for myself, and amlooking for a graphics card to drive it.  I want > 70Hz refresh,and would really like it to handle my CD-Roms.  I tried the Orchid P9000,which did neither of those things (though Robert at Wietek did say that the>70Hz was possible if I modifed the driver data base).  So my thoughts go backto Hercules.  They were supposed to be coming out with a VLB version of theGraphite around the end of March.  I have heard precisely ZERO about it sincethen.  Does anyone know if the card was actually released, and what capabilities(and price) it has?Any info would be most appreciated.Geoff Sherwood

 57Hello all,You, the Net, are my last resort, or I'll just change my job :-)This might be a FAQ (e.g. mixing controllers) but haven't seen any.Sys: 486/33, AMI BIOS, and your run-of-the mill multi-I/O card withserials/paral/floppies and - IDE controller "clone" Gw2760-EXthere are no jumpers affecting the HD or ctrller :-( - Quantum ProDrive LPS (3" 105M type 47: 755cyl, 16hds, 17spt).Pb: I want to bring in this (2nd hand, neat price):- Maxtor XT-B380E (~330M, <15ms, BIOS type 1, ctrller managesthe real geom: 1630cyl, 8hds, 52spt)- Western Digital WD1007V-SE1 ESDI ctrller: no floppies.(jumpers set IRQ 14/15, hw port addr 1F0/170,and BIOS addr CC00/C800, and other floppy/format stuff)Goal: have the WD ESDI as a secondary/controller and have both disks simultaneously working. Being able to boot from the ESDI too would be a nice bonus but is not expected.Ultimate goal: have room for Linux et al.Ex of scheme I have in mind: boot from IDE (HD or floppy) and mountthe ESDI as root. Not booting from ESDI, or even from HD, is acceptable.I have tried numerous (all!!) combinations to no avail. They work alone,or can coexist witout hang-ups but can't access the ESDI or the IDE, depending on setup/jumpers.Useful suggestions might be:- How do I tell the BIOS setup about two ctrllers (I guess the 2nd HDis expected to hang off the same ctrller as the 1st).- Do I need some driver to make it work?- --- " --- some new BIOS/chip for any of these cards?- do I have to buy another controller to make them HDs happy? IDEis cheaper; ESDI is hard to find and rather costly. I'm not rich or I wouldnt' try to scavenge around, so soft slns are preferred.- adapters of some sort; I can hold a soldering iron, and can changea chip or put a jumper!Also useful:- BBS or Hot-line of Western Digital.- ftp archives with relevant info.- expert stores in Toronto, Ontario area (that would be a miracle! haven'tseen any really knowledgeable ppl in a while)- any hints into inner workings of the system ... - anything else that helped you in similar situations (prayers :-) )Direct or posted replies are ok.Many thanks,Cat.--////// /// // / /  /  /   /   /    /     /      /      /        / Catalin Ivan - email: ivan@Iro.UMontreal.CA - tel:(416) 324.8704         Human-Computer   INTERACTION   Humain-Machine Universite de Montreal - Informatique et Recherche Operationelle

 54Thinking of buying from MidWest Micro of Ohio? Think *very* carefully.Unless you are absolutely sure you won't have any problems, you may wantto trade elsewhere.Despite the fact that they answer the phone, "Hi! I'm <whoever> and we'rehaving a GREAT Day!", they weren't quite so happy when I wanted to returna modem that didn't work as I expected it to.The details:I ordered one of their house brand "Infotel" 14.4/DF internal FAX modems.In reality, it was a Twincom Lightning FAX that had a paper sticker overthe name. Given the poor reports on the net about this modem, I would nothave ordered it, had I known this in advance.It arrived on time. The documentation stated that it would work (and waspreconfigured) as COM4, providing that COM2 was not in use at the same time.For several reasons, I have a serial card configured for COM1/COM2. At thetime I installed the modem, nothing was connected to COM2.Although the modem appeared to work, during every connection at 9600 or14.4, it would randomly break the connection and hang up the phone. Afterspending some time on the phone with MidWest's tech support, they suggesteddisabling the COM2 port.This appeared to solve the disconnect problem, but was an unacceptable longterm solution. I had to have COM1 and 2 available, even though they bothwould not be in use at the same time as the modem.I called back 20 minutes prior to their closing and waited in Voicemail hell, listening to repeated advertisements for MidWest Micro products. I was then promptly disconnected. Apparently it was quiting time and they didn't want to be bothered with callers that had been waiting on the line.I called the next day and asked the Customer Diservice agent for an RMAnumber. She promptly switched me to a "Tech Support" rep that implied thatit was my equipment at fault and that he wasn't going to give me an RMAnumber. He suggested I use some nonstandard IRQ settings, a solution Iwas not happy with. The modem should work as originally configured.Conclusion:I'm not sure the modem would work ok in a basic system, but it clearly doesnot work in a multi port system like mine. Since my time is worth more than the aggravation or the cost of the modem, I gave it to a localcharitable organization (with a description of my problem) and ordereda Practical Peripherals 14.4MT from PC Connection.For $30 more, I have a solid external modem built by a company I know will support their users and sold by a company (based on personalexperience) will treat me right if there is a problem. I should haveknown better...

The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapesthat did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out andhad closed the little marker hole.  It was only on a few tapes of a set.Did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels?If you have not yet, open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom ofthe tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base.  As you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more than you have to.  As you are doing it, look for a couple of little holes in the tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is at the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My bestguess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the secondmarker?  Anyhow, If the tape has the holes, then check to see if the mirror on the tapeis clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  Thetape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area wherethe reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by, the pickup detects the light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirtyor out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might havea problem detecting the end of the tape.If the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good, then eitherthe pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you openthe drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W headassembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way, then the drive mayneed to be serviced.  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensoris out.

So the lowly low-density original PC FDD card used DMA and the PC-ATHDD controller doesn't!?!?  That makes real sense.

 42I never thought I'd contribute to a Gateway thread, either pro or con, butmy spleen could use a little venting.  The scenario:1 - Ordered a DX2/50 w/ Ultrastor 34F Local Bus HD controller2 - Receive system 10 days after ordering (Happy)3 - Discover Ultrastor 14F ISA HD Controller inside (unhappy)4 - Call Gateway, receive the correct controller in 5 days (getting happier)5 - New controller doesn't work (unhappy again)6 - Call Gateway again, get another controller in 5 more days(cooling off, the end is in sight)7 - This controller doesn't work either, motherboard is bad(VERY unhappy)Gateway's solution:  They will order me a new motherboard (5 more days)and have on-site service install it for me.BUT, I have to take a day off of work because the service peopleonly work 9-5 M-f.  I say, no way I've already blown about 20 hourswith this, about 10 of them on hold and I don't have the time or $$to take a day off work.  Also, my 30 day return period is almost over andI've only been able to use the thin for about 10 minutes.  So, the whole thing is going back.    I was extremely upset when I began this post because the support rep told methat I would have to pay shipping not only for the returned system, but alsothe two hard drive controllers they had sent me.  Fortunately, I just spoketo customer service and they are going to have UPS come and pick everythingup gratis. The only downside is that now I have to order another computer.I would really like to try Gateway again, I'm just very turned off by theprospect of having to try and get through to Customer Service or Tech Supportagain...  I think their products are great for the most part, but I'mbeginning to wonder if the savings are worth the potential aggravation.Are other mail order companies as difficult to contact?  I know Gateway isbooming, and for good reason, but I don't know if I can take it again.Oh well, I feel better now...-- -----_____-----_____-----_____-----_____-----_____-----_____-----_____-----| Mark Devaney                     - Hear me now and believe me later     || Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta Georgia, 30332  || Internet: markd@cc.gatech.edu     |
 27This might be a silly question but I have to ask it anyway. I am inthe process of purchasing an EISA/VL Bus 486 DX2-66 computer and Ifound two places that sell machines that have what I want and have thesame price. The first is Ares and they use a Cache motherboard (that'sthe brand of the motherboard) with OPTI chip set, the other is Micron(formerly Edge Technology) and they use the Micronics EISA/VLBmotherboard.I said that this might be a silly question since I believe thatMicronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while I neverheard of Cache! I am however leaning towards the Ares machine becausemy impression is that they are known for building good, solid machinesand they have good tech support (24 hr, 7 days/wk), and a betterwarrantee (2 years).  Micron, on the other hand, seems to haverecently aquired Edge Technologies and I'm not sure how much I shouldtrust the company.I would REALLY appreciate any input on this. Is the Micron machine theclear choice?  Does anyone know anything positive or negative abouteither company? Has anyone ever heard of Cache motherboards? Should Igo with Micron just because it has the Micronics motherboard? etc.Thanks very much in advance for any information.--Mohammad Al-Ansari

 39Hi,    I've just replaced my existing DTC SCSI controller with an Adaptec 1542B,and am now having trouble restoring from a Jumbo 250 tape drive.    I had no trouble installing the Adaptec and DOS recognises both the SCSIdrive and an existing IDE drive - however when I went to restore the backupsfrom the Jumbo tape I found that it was extremely slow (estimated time 3 minsactual time 15 min!) I have no trouble restoring from the same tape to the IDEdrive.    I seem to remember reading that some settings had to be changed to enable the Jumbo drive and the Adaptec to work together but I can't find anymention of it in the manuals. My system config is:   i486DX/33 4Mb    Adaptec 1542B running 180Mb Fujitsu SCSI   IDE Controller running 200Mb IDE   Jumbo 250 running off floppy controller on IDE  Any help would be appreciated    Thanks,   Ron.

In the Mac {since SCSI is THEinteface for any non-card, non-modem, not-keyboard device} the id 7 is usedfor the floppy drive {called CPU in all identifiers.}  This allows crossdrive interfacing as fast as the OS, program, CPU, SCSI, and drive can handle it{this shows up best in the Quatra line}.In the IBM that uses SCSI for the FLOPPY drive this should happen as well.Also SCSI is NOT just drives but printers, scanners, expandsion cards {this showed up for the Plus as the NuBus 'Cage'}, CD-ROM, etc.IDE seems to be mainly hard drives.  As for specs nobody has GIVEN me anyand I can't find any.  Besides the advertizments call IDE the AT interface{Make of that what you will}SCSI is a jack of all trades and IDE is a master of ONE.This alone puts SCSI above IDE.  SCSI-2 blows IDE out of the water.Remember SCSI was used in high priced machines until about 18 months ago{When the Mac prices came down to Earth} so the Rule of Scale still playedand SCSI remained high cost{cheap seems to mean chezzy in the High endcomputer world at times and THIS more than anything else proably kept SCSIoff into the statosphere price wise}SCSI came FROM the high end computer world with multitasking OS were thestandard for the most part.  Of all the interface NeXT could have used itchoose SCSI.  In 16-bit and 32-bit mode SCSI is a multi-tasking OS desinedinterface while IDE and 8-bit SCSI are braindead run one program interfaces{at least the way mac use 8-bit SCSI.UGH}

If anyone knows what can be causing this, please let me know.Most likely reason is that your backup battery is failing - this battery maintains the contents of the CMOS memory when AC power is turned off, andif the battery is flakey then the contents of the CMOS will be lost and the checksum will be wrong (along with most other of the CMOS data). Try replacing the battery.If, however, your PC doesn't use a battery but a large capacitor to powerthe CMOS, you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a more normal lithium battery. If this isn't possible, make sure you leaveyour PC on for a half hour or hour each day; this will keep the capacitor charged. I'd opt for the battery change, though.It's also possible, but unlikely that a rogue problem or even a virus is corrupting the CMOS. If your battery seems okay, get a virus scanner andcheck out your system.

 22Hi world,                I want to buy a Spirit II 14400 Data/Fax modem (made in U.S.A.).Have anyone heard about it or using it? What is it's performance? Is itstable or not? Please give me some advice.         In addition, I heard a news from local distributor that a new28800baud CCITT ROM (the distributor said it will be the new CCITT standard.) for this modem will be produced at the end of this year. After replaced the old ROM by this 28800 ROM, this Spirit II cantransfer data at 28800baud without any hardware alternation. Is this new true and possible? Would the telephone line really able to transfer at such high speed? Please give me some advice.         At last, can anyone tell me how to contact with the central dealer QuickComm. Inc.? (I am not sure whether it in U.S.A. or not.)Please leave me a e-mail. Thank you very much. Leung (from Hong Kong University)
 15Hi,I'm looking to buy a 17" monitor soon, and it seems that I can't decide whatmonitor I should buy. I have a MAG 17S (this is a .25 dpi version and it usinga TRINITON tube) and a NANAO 560i in mind.Does anyone know of any specification or problems these monitor have?Actually, any related opinions at buying a 17" monitor will be welcomed.

Where do they get those numbers? I'll list the actualperformance ranges, which should convince anyone that such astatement is absurd:SCSI-I ranges from 0-5MB/s.SCSI-II ranges from 0-40MB/s.IDE ranges from 0-8.3MB/s.ESDI is always 1.25MB/s (although there are some non-standard versions)

It has 16Kof internal cache, which probably is where the saved silicon realestate went.

Of course, nothing prevents othercompanies from implementing a DX3/99, but nobody hasn't even come outwith a real 486DX (FPU and all) clone yet (although AMD soon will).--Segmented Memory Helps Structure Software

 30Fellow netters,I'm in the market for a hand scanner.  However, I don't know anyone who hasone.  I have my eye on two choices.Dexxa:  This scanner is available at Wal-Mart for $90.  It includes GrayWorkssoftware and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (I think).  The OCR softwareCatchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.Mustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales(according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169mail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE.I am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  Itis basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400dpi) and price ($149).  Basically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard thatLogitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is thebest buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HPLaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?  I am leaning toward theMustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms ofprices.  Which should I buy?If you have a hand scanner, please let me know whether or not you wouldrecommend it.  Also, if you know of another scanner within the price range(under $225) that would be a better deal, please E-Mail me.  Any and all helpwould be greatly appreciated.- Kevin Harter
 27Greetings,        Please forgive me if this is FAQ. If there is source on this kind of info, please let me know. I just got a 286 station (around 21*16.5*7 in dimension),and I am thinking about upgrade it to a 486 or 386.        The station has a power supply, two floppy disk drives, and the bigcase. I have SONY 1304 monitor, SyQuest drive (Mac), and maybe a cd-romreader (Mac) for it. Here are the questions I have so far:1) Is there a 486 motherboard at this dimension that I could use the case?2) The original owener has the controller for floppy drive and hard diskremoved. Can I use them to control these devices under 486? How much do Ihave to pay for a new controllers if the old ones won't work?3) How can I make SyQuest (SCSI) and cd-rom (SCSI) work on this station? I heard that there is a cheap sound board that has SCSI controller built-in?What's quality of this board? How much usually does a SCSI control cost?Is there any ftp sites that has SyQuest driver or cd-rom driver for the PC ifI can have everything hooked up OK?4) What I want is a 486 motherboard, a sound board to make it a MPC- quality station. How much would it cost to do that? Is it worth the husslethan just buy a new 486 station? BTW, I need to buy a keyboard for it too.Any input is welcome.Thank you.Peter Liu
 12This may be a dumb question, but I need to put a hard drive on my father'sPC/XT, either MFM, RLL, or IDE. I know how to hook it up, but how do I tellthe computer the geometry of the drive. On my 386, you set it in the BIOS, butI doubt that's how it's done on an XT. I thought it might be software withthe controller card, but the IDE card for XT's that I saw didn't come withany. Also, how do I low level format it once it's on the computer? (Assuminga drive which needs formatting)advTHANKSance,Robrxg3321@ultb.isc.rit.edu

 24About two months ago I purchased the Adaptec ASW-410 driver for use with aCD-ROM drive.  At the time this seemed the thing to do as the documentation Ihad with my Adaptec SCSI controller said that this is the driver to be used withCD-ROM drives.  Since then I have learn that this driver is out of date in amajor way and that Adaptec have an upgrade deal for going to the next driver(I think it's called EZI-SCSI or something).  I wasn't too fussed about thisuntil I upgraded by CD-ROM drive from a Sony CDU-541 to a Sony CDU-641.  I nowfind that the audio-mode will not work.  I assume it is not being handledcorrectly by the ASW-410 driver.So, should I chase Adaptec for an upgrade?  If so does anyone know theirFAX number?Any assistance appreciated.RegardsBTW: everything else works fine, certainly seems that Sony have caught up with     the rest with the 641.-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<  Nigel Harwood  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><< Post:  Coles Supermarkets, PO Box 480 Glen Iris 3146, Australia >><< Phone: +61 3 829 6090  E-mail: nigel@cnw01.storesys.coles.oz.au >><<   FAX: +61 3 829 6886                                           >>

I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly.I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.

But, you bought your PC forexpandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  Thefollowing are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE:A (partial?) list:1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them concurrently.2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a macand a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nicewith SCSI -- hook them up and away they go)3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  Forinstance, recently, I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It willwork no other way.  On SCSI, you set the address, check thetermination, plug it in, and away it goes.4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice thatthe time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: isquite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c:to d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS, this is verynoticable, as many things can be going on at once.One neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been theability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system withlittle problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I'veadded to my PC.  I've now got the interface full, but, it does allow me tohave 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg driveall on the same card.  Simply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.  No mysterious jumpers to figure out.Greg.-- _______________________________________________________________________________You can't go against nature, because when you do, Greg Shawgo against nature, it's part of nature too.shaw@feanor.xel.com Love & Rocketsuunet!csn!xel.com!shaw
 10The Quantum LPS 240AT is supposed to have a 256K cache on the IDEcontroller built into the card.  Yet when I do a DOS DIR commandon my system, the disk is always accessed (I can hear the mechanicalmovement of the heads).  Why is this happening?  Strangely, evenwhen I have smartdrive installed, every DIR command accesses thedisk.  Did I somehow de-activate the cache?  This is happening on each of two machines with an LPS 240AT drive.-- Will EstesInternet: westes@netcom.com

 43I have uploaded the most recent Windows drivers for the Cirrus GD5426 chip based display cards to the uploads directory at ftp.cica.indiana.edu (file is 5426dr13.zip). They're very recent, I downloaded them from the Cirrus BBS (570-226-2365) last night. If you are unable to get them there, email me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well.  I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them).I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version, improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88) although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on Cirrus's part but I don't think so.From Steve Gibson's (columnist for Info World) graphic card comparisons (also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) I extracted the following for the sake of comparison:Wintach             Winbn3.11WordSprshtCadPaintOverallSteve's system:486/33 VLB:ATI Graphics Ultra Pro  9.3310.34 20.788.2814.90 13.58my system -486sx/33 VLB:VL24 Bitblaster  9.88 8.65 11.7118.8415.40 13.65Its no Viper, but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of the ATI card and when compared to the other cards included in Gibson's review.Micron system owner's, I would be interested to hear your opinions on the DTC 2270VL local bus disk controller. My system came with a Maxtor 7120 drive (120 MB) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 Kb/s, I am now at 22 Kb/s. Is this about as good as it gets? I can't get a Norton'ssysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls, at least that was what the program said.Oliver Weatherbeeoliver@earthview

Again from my Mac & IBM infosheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in theinfo-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare173.txt}:ExpansionBoth Mac & IBMSCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM. Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card  expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Apple developed some  specifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controller  specifications {which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines}.   Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal  terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port  {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the  end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave} and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base.  16-bit SCSI-1 requires a SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2 which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}.SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it  needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be  very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst  {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices and reduced 8-bit or 16-bit {fast only} throughput due to the difference between SCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports.IBMHD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}:[...]IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics  currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized  drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.So at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 modeit blows poor IDE out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can.The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through putrates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOTthe interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use theSCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fullilingprophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, whichin turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce itscost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of theRule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the bruntthe cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost}SCSI-2 allows a drive mechanisims through put to be limited by the DRIVE whileIDE itself limits the through put.

 25Hi everyone,I have a question regarding my stack on my pc.  I am programming in Turbo C 3.0 and my program is rather large (model large too).  I keep getting errors that I am running out of memory after a while of running the program. When I compile the program, it says I have 4.45 meg of RAM so I can't seem to explain why it crashes.All it is doing is running in a loop while the operator is idle andafter a while of sitting, it will screw up all the variables. This leadsme to believe that my stack is filling up and overflowing.  Does the program take memory up when it is calling void functionsthat do not return anything??I have been working on this problem for days and I would reallyappreciate any responce.  If this is not the correct newsgroup, I willgladly re-post, but this is the only I could find.Thanks in advance,Sean MarsEmail mars@carroll1.cc.eduCarroll College Waukesha, WI

 46Experiences with Diamond Viper VLB video cardSeveral problems:1) The ad specified 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1MB   of VRAM, which is what I have. This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED   with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. A max of 65K   colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB   VRAM.2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations:   a) Under NDW, when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an      Open menu) and then is deselected, a faint vertical line often      remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to      be.   b) With Word for Windows, when you use shading in a table, the      display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example, if you      shade the cell as 10%, the display is 90% (the printout is OK).3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development   Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger   icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command), and the   debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed   to do). The screen goes haywire, and is largely unreadable. The   Turbo Debugger display is all garbled.   Through trial and error, I have found that when the disrupted screen   is displayed you should do [Alt-Spacebar] followed by the letter   "R". This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen, and it   does this satisfactorily. I wish I didn't have to do this.   The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers. The same disruptive   behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with   Windows. There must be something in the video card that mishandles   the VGA mode.      The problem is not my monitor. The same bug shows up when I use   another monitor in place of my usual one.I still like this video card, and am hoping its problems will beremedied (they do offer a 5 year warranty).---swh, 20apr93

That makes real sense.Actually, it does make a reasonable amount of sense. Fixed disksectors are buffered by the controller, and transferring them tomemory with a 'rep insw' (or whatever the instruction is called) isquite efficient (single instruction, goes as fast as thecontroller/cpu know how to use the bus). Since the 286 wasn't cached,the bus is likely a critical resource relative to CPU performance, andit's possible that DMA bus interference would cause as much or moreloss of CPU cycles (for 'computing') as does the 'rep insw' sequence.The floppy, on the other hand, is not buffered, so that using the CPUfor floppy data transfer (as was done on the PC Jr, by the way) reallydoes stink.Wally Bass

 18Just taken delivery of a 66MHz 486 DX2 machine, and very nice it is too.One query - the landmark speed when turbo is on is 230 or something MHz- thats not the problem. The problem is the speed when turbo is off. Its7 MHz. The equivalent in car terms is having a nice Porsche with a buttonthat turns it into a skateboard.Does anyone have a clue as to what determines the relative performance ofturbo vs non-turbo?? I would like to set it to give a landmark speed ofabout 30 or 40 MHz with turbo off.Cheers,--  +-- Nic Percival ----------+- "Well that was a piece of cake, eh K-9?" -----+ |   Micro Focus, Newbury.  |  "Piece of cake master?

 21Can any body tell me where the most significant bit of the total horizontalwidth hides out on the Tseng Labs ET4000 with a 15/16/24 bit dac?I am trying to use the 640x480x16M mode under unix (so i cant just call int 10h)I have a program which dumps the contents of the card registers under dos, but Iam not sure I trust it for the extended registers of the et4000.Anyway, the problem is that in this mode, the Horizontal Total Register(3d4h index0) is apparently set to 0x27, but 3d4h index 1 (the displayed clocks)is set to 0xEF, so 0x27 is nonsense. A resonable value would be 0x0127 - so isthere a high bit, and if so, where is it?Also, how does one set the video dot clock to the appropriate frequency ( andwhat would be an appropriate frequency?). The documentation isn't really veryclear (tseng.txt from  vgadoc2.zip from some ftp site) about this.My card is a MegaVga/1024 1Mb card. Seems to have a Tseng Labs Bios (ver 8.05 Ithink.) Works nicely under dos, and very well under unix (linux) in all thenon-hicolor modes. Great for running X-windows in up to 1152x900x256ni - if yourmonitor will take it (only just in my case).Please email the answer, as I can't read news very often.Thanks very much,David

 15 I have recently plunged into PC World. I have been using Amigas before. Trying to establish a network (LAN) here that could use 2 different printers. Panasonic KXP2124 for printing receipts and Okidata OL400 for letters etc. Is it at all possible in this world ? I know when using Unix etc I can specify which printer to print from.

I think it all depends on your motherboard and the cards you have in your system.  Your HD stopped boot probably because your HD controller can't handle the faster BUS speed.  I have a 486-33DX, I set my bus divider to CLK/2.5, that is close to 13MHz.  I can gain singificant performace increase on my Video card and harddisk transfer rate when I boost the bus speed.

 9I have an 8-bit serial card with two ports.  Each port has the option ofusing IRQ 2,3,4 or 5.  I also have two serial ports on a multi-I/O card,and the ports can be set to IRQ 3,4,5,7 or 9.

 81Hi:I need some advice (opinions?) regarding which PC would best suit my needs!I want to use this (proposed) beast for basically four things:       -Editing documents using WordPerfect 5.1 (under dos)     -Creating graphs/analyzing data using Sigmaplot V5.0 (under dos)     -Editing/playing with images using Aldus PhotoStyler, running under Windows 3.1 - these images can be large, say 2k x 2k, 24bits/pixel     -Using the PC as an Xterminal, running DesqView/X 1.1 and Sun PC-NFS, talking to our network of Sparcstation's - this is where a lot ofthe images/data come from, and is the most demanding of these tasks.I've read, read, read PC magazines, performed benchmarks, read this newsgroup,and decided that a "nice" system (price/performance) would be:486DX-50 256k cache, ISA, VLB, 16meg ramATI Graphics Ultra Pro, 2 meg ram, local bus15" monitor, 1280x1024 NI3Com Etherlink III 16bitMaxtor 240MB IDE hard driveHowever, the parts don't fit!  Our local retailer apparently put one of thesetogether, only to discover that the ATI card wouldn't run at 50MHz - surprisesurprise.  Actually, after reading this group, I'm surprised that they evenhave a 50MHz local bus running...I have a choice now between basically the above system but with a486DX2-66 with ISA and VLB,  or,   a 486DX-50 with EISA and no VLB (and thusthe non-local bus version of the ATI card).  Which is better, keeping in mindthat I'm primarily interested in the last two tasks?  Any help would be greatly appreciated!  (I need to decide quickly, so any speedy help would be appreciated even more!!)BTW: We have a system now to perform these tasks, it has the following configuration:486DX-33 64k cache, ISA, 8 meg ramATI Graphics Ultra+, 2 meg ram14" monitor, 1024x768 NISMC Ethercard 8 bitMaxtor 120MB IDE hard driveWe're quite happy with the ATI card - very fast, ONCE the data gets to it!!~Slow~ repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen, orbeen uncovered!  There doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqView/X!  Its sluggishrunning the local window manager.  Also, many functions under PhotoStyler takea long time (even when the images fit entirely in ram).There's not enough memory in the system - DesqView/X and a 1 meg SmartDrivedon't leave much room for other apps.  Photostyler will page to disk withmedium size images.I have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates.  Thismachine sustains only 120k/sec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain 600k/sec on the same network.  Going to the 16 bit version of the SMC card increasestransfer rates to 160k/sec - still very slow (especially when moving large images).  Is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming??

 16I have a Colorado Memory Systems Jumbo 250 tape backup unit in my Gateway486/33V Tower system. I have found the supplied backup capability to be fairly unreliable. In approx 3 cases out of 10, I have had the backup failat one point or another, often hanging in the middle of writing the tape.Seek errors, drive communication errors seem to be most common. I use theDOS backup software from Colorado Memory Systems. Should I return the drive,get some better backup software, reformat the tapes (am using CMS tapes)?Any hints would be appreciated - this stuff is to time-consuming to do overand over again until it cooperates...Steve Normansnorman@den.mmc.com

 30Hi,   I'm currently in the process of writing a number of PD programsfor the sound blaster. The first of which is a CMF voice editor whichis hopefully going to be available soon (as soon as I can get it to an FTP site).Anyway the next stage is to use the midi port to enter music and playthe FM synth remotely. The problem is that I have little or no infoon the SB midi port.I have tried using the Sound blaster freedom project routines, howeverthis just results in the port locking after a couple of accesses andloss the of note velocity data byte.I am using Turbo C and would be grateful for any info or source fragmentsmay help. When I was in Berlin this summer I saw a book which seemed tohave all this information, but my German is poor to say the least, if anyonehas this book could they please mail me.My second request for help concerns standard file formats (how can a file format be standard if you keep it secret ?) I need to know the file format for instrument bank files *.BNK and Roland music files *.ROL.Finally does anyone have a source for displaying PCX or GIF files to EGAor VGA monitors.Please Help, You know it makes sense.Colin

 33   I am DESPERATELY trying to find a PC based e-mail wide area network serviceor the necessary network software to establish one myself. While I am awarethere are various BBS's and other similar services avalible (like Compuserve,Canada Remote Systems etc.) I require fairly specific criteria. In approximate order of importance they are:1) The mail/files/news are read/written locally and batched to the network   server. (ie. no continuous on-line connection)(NOTE: all users are remote   and will use modems over conventional phone lines.)2) Simple. The users I have for the system have very little computer knowledge   have never heard of Unix, and have very little interest in learning. It is   essential that the client software is completely pain-free.3) Cheap. We would prefer not paying high connect fees to an established   commercial network, just so we can send large files between members of the   group - hence (1). In addition I would like the network server to be   something small, simple and inexpensive like a 486. (There are only about   40 people in the group, so it is not a huge network.)4) The capability for Internet access (for news/mail).5) Internet style id's (eg. pwood@math.uwaterloo.ca)   If anyone knows of a system similar to what I am describing, even if itdoesn't sastisfy all my criteria, and I don't care where it is, PLEASE PLEASEe-mail me and tell me about it. We are not adverse to making alterations toan existing system if necessary.Thanks.Peter Wood                        Internet id: pwood@math.uwaterloo.ca

Norton diskdoctor keeps marking some U and some C.  That FIXES it.  For about 5 minutes.Then next day when I run NDD on it again: NO DICE more uncorrectable andcorrectable sectors.  AHHHHHUUUURRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!  So I fugure: "Ok, NDD'sjust not being thurough enough, I'll use Spinrite, I heard that works well."What happens?  Spinrite goes and returns the clusters to active use!!!  AHHHUUUURRRRRRGGGGGHHHH!!!!  NDD undoes it of course.  The problem seams tobe getting worse and worse.  HOWEVER when the HDD is low level formattedagain the problem goes away for a while, only to return in a day or so.I'm so pissed off right now I'm considering buying another HDD, and I reallycan't afford it.I'm using SMARTDRIVE, and WINDOWS 3.1 (I'm not using the 32 bit disk accessthough, I know that can create problems).  The disk is using the secondoption to trick the controller into thinking it's got less then 1024 cyls,and everything else selected is standard, maybe I need to use a differenthead skew or something?

I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them).I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version, improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88) although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on Cirrus's part but I don't think so.From Steve Gibson's (columnist for Info World) graphic card comparisons (also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) I extracted the following for the sake of comparison:Wintach             Winbn3.11WordSprshtCadPaintOverallSteve's system:486/33 VLB:ATI Graphics Ultra Pro  9.3310.34 20.788.2814.90 13.58my system -486sx/33 VLB:VL24 Bitblaster  9.88 8.65 11.7118.8415.40 13.65Its no Viper, but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of the ATI card and when compared to the other cards included in Gibson's review.Micron system owner's, I would be interested to hear your opinions on the DTC 2270VL local bus disk controller. My system came with a Maxtor 7120 drive (120 MB) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 Kb/s, I am now at 22 Kb/s. Is this about as good as it gets? I can't get a Norton'ssysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls, at least that was what the program said.Oliver Weatherbeeoliver@earthview

 18The fan in my power supply, like most, is distractingly LOUD. Has anyone found a solution to running a pc with peace and quiet? Short of buying a notebook PC, I don't know what to do. Oh yeah, I did hear about a power supply called a "Silencer" - which is supposed to be more quiet. Has anyone had experience withthis? I was quoted a price of $225 (!) for a 270Watt Silencer.I've even considered stuffing my PC case in one of those acoustic "printer enclosures", but that wouldn't be the most elegant solution. Also, I'm guessing that would also cut the ventilation.Any other ideas?Thanks in advance for ANY suggestions!

But no problem so far.When I dismantled it, I discovered that it is really just a standardRGB monitor with built in modem/ROM software etc.Phillips kindly labelled the circuit board with the RGB inputs, so Iconnected it up as a monitor and he presto it worked - sort of.The problem is that I have no idea where to connect the Sync lines.The display rolls continuously, but does change modes (OK only toCGA - but useful for my laptop).Any of you wonderful people any knowledge of Phillips monitors?I've tried Phillips in the UK and a very helpful guy told me thathe has had several enquiries of this sort, but Phillips Computeris now under the auspices of DEC (at least in the UK).

When a BIOS recieve call is made, it asserts DTR andwaits for DSR to become true (times out after a while and returns with anerror if DSR never becomes true).  It requires CTS to be true for sendingAND recieving.  Most communications packages bypass this and replace itwith their own protocol.  The key is that each comm. package could verywell have different requirements.My favorite cable works in many cases: short RTS to CTS at each end, butalso run RTS through to DCD at the opposite end.  TD runs through to RDand DTR runs through to DSR from both DTE's and of course SG goes throughto SG.I have never had trouble with this null modem even though I have used itwith a comm. package that was expecting RTS to go to CTS instead of DCD.The advantage of this cable is that it also works with the IBM BIOS.Gordon Lang

 5Does anyone have enough experience to report whether disk datacompression has any effect on the optimal disk sector interleave?Offhand, I expect that the time required to decompress disk datawould increase the optimum disk sector interleave.                                              - Alan Hinds

In addition to the master/slave jumper on an IDE drive there is also   another jumper to indicate whether a slave is present.  Get it right!3. The cabling is not an issue as long as pin 1 goes to pin 1 goes to   pin 1.  No twisting or swapping on an IDE cable.  Be sure of pin 1   on all three components - do not make assumptions (guesses are ok   but assumptions are bad).4. If the cable and jumpers are correct, and the CMOS setup is correct,   then you may have to do an FDISK followed by a high level format.

 18Stupid question from a new IBM PC user:I'm going to be selling my Mac and getting a Gateway 2000.What is the difference between IDE HD and SCSI HD?The GW 486DX-33V comes with a 250MB Western Digital IDE drive.I asked how much more for the Seagate 500MB SCSI drive.The guy asked me "Why are you going with SCSI?".  I was lost for an answer.I just said "I know Seagate better as a company, from a satisfaction pointof view".Are SCSI drives faster than IDE?  I'm not buying my GW for another 4 monthsor so, but this is a question that has bugged me for a while.      - Tom N.

In Linux, for example, there are utilitiesthat will put the card in VESA mode before invoking X.  Of course,this means no fine tuning of Diamond cards, but at least thiswill allow those who're stuck with them to use Linux+X.I agree with Mark's suggestion:  If you are buying a video cardfor specialized free software, avoid Diamond.

Compliers maybe written to allow programs to take consitant advantage of the 68040's PCLK in the future.  As it is now, studies such as one in a Byte article {which showed 040/25 ~486/50 and roughly ~486dx2/50} are very dependent on the machine, OS, and programs tested and as such are not representative of general performance.*#Motorola claims (PC Week 09/07/92; 09/14/92).As the PowerPCs are to be in both IBM and Mac machines I have listed them separately to eliminate redundancy.

These chips may flounder against the cheaper (PC Week 3/08/93; 4/12/93; PC Mag 4/27/93:110), earlier released (PC Week 12/7/92; MacWeek 12/14/92; PC Week 2/08/93), less leat producing {160 degrees F for Pentium(PC Mag 4/27/93:118)}, and partly ported to PowerPC chips.} PowerPC   = PowerPC {This CPU line is planned to run programs from DOS, Windows 3.x, OS/2 and Mac OS on top of PowerOpen-A/UX 4.0 [UNIX] and later Pink [Taligent OS] by using emulators or, if necessary, the OSes themselves in a 'shell' a.k. how SoftPC or OS/2 does DOS.}Hardware {In an effort to remove the 'reconfiguring the system almost every time you add something' requirement for add-in cards, drivers, video, and operating systems in the IBM world, Intel, Microsoft and 12 other hardware and software developers are working out 'plug and play' standards (PC Week 03/08/93).}Color Support/Display Mac: 30.24 MHz Pixel Clock standard.  All present Macs support the use of 32-bit color through 32-bit color QuickDraw in ROM.  32-bit color QuickDraw allows an almost transparent capability to display and edit X-bit images in Y-bit color and retain ALL the colors of Y-bit color [Where X and Y independently are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32] regardless of monitor resolution {63 dpi [12" color] to 94 dpi [PaletteBook]} or monitor type {including autosynchronous VGA, MCGA and SVGA monitors with ranges including 66.7 hz vertically and 35 kHz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor (MacUser Aug 1992: 158-176).  Older machines that supported color {SE/30, II, IIX, and IIcx} had only 8-bit color in ROM and needed a software patch to use 32-bit color (MacUser Special 1993:28-29).  To keep costs down and speed up most Macs have only 8 or 16 bit display capability built-in, but most of those can be expanded to display 24-bit color.    Presently QuickDraw is optimized for 72 dpi display; QuickDraw QX will change this.In addition, QuickDraw allows, in Macs with a NuBus slot, more then one monitor to be used in any combination, from two monitors showing the same thing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree of overlap of the pictures.VRAM: Video RAM.  Standard for present non-PowerBook Mac's handling of  built-in video {from a 32-bit color palette}. VRAM provided runs a 8-bit color 640x480 display; expandable to 16-bit color or a 8-bit 832x624 display. Sound output:  Standard in all Macs since the 128K.  Stereo sound became  standard with the SE/30.IBM:  Even though PCs have ROM BIOS definitions of how the operating system interacts with the video hardware (Nan Zou), the use of drivers bypassing BIOS, video hareware inconsitancies {see Super VGA below} and nonstanderzationof clone BIOS have left resolution of video display hardware, OS and program interaction up to the OS and video hardware in question (Faisal Nameer Jawdat). In addition, IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a standard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is actually present (Matt Healy) nor a standardized screen-drawing toolbox {like Mac's QD}. As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes, especially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly {At present things are so dependent on the interaction of the program, OS, print driver and monitor card that editing 32-bit pictures regardless of color mode, OS, and monitor type/card combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with an IBM.  For example, one cannot edit a 32-bit color picture done on a OS/2 486 with a SVGA monitor on a 386 with VGA {18-bit color palette} and DOS 5.0 and still have ALL the colors one started out with}.Later IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators, faster processors, and modular upgradeability and may have built-in sound cards, CD ROM, and Ethernet (PC Week 12/14/92).  MDA: Monocrome Display Adapter original character-mapped video mode, no graphics, 80x25 text.CGA: Color Graphics Array 320x200 4 colors or 640x200 b/w, 16 color palette, bad for the eyes.EGA:  Enhanced Graphics Array 640x350 16 colors from 64 color palette [and some lower res]; some versions  could run at 256 colors, bearable on the eyes.VGA:  Video Graphics Array* 320x200 at 256 colors, 640x480 at 16 colors, and some others, these two are  the most commonly used.  All modes have a 256K CLUT, from a  18 to 24-bit {IBM} or a 32-bit {Mac} color palette.  25.175 MHz Pixel Clock (Mel Martinez).  Monitors use analog input, incompatible with TTL signals from EGA/CGA etc. MCGA:  Multi-Color Graphics Array* subset of VGA that provides all the features of MDA & CGA, but lacks some EGA  and VGA modes, like VGA 640x480x16 (Dictionary of Computer Terms-DCT).   Common on the initial PS/1 implementation from IBM and some PS/2 Models.SVGA:  Super VGA* This is not a standard in the way the others were, but instead was a 'catch  all' category for a group of video cards.  As such, with each manufacturer  using their own implementation scheme, SVGA was chaos with people debating as to what is SVGA and what is not.  In an effort to make SVGA more of a  standard VESA was established and is used in the newer units, but things are still a mess.  Video is either 512K [~1990] or 1M [today], resolution of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common, newer ones [since  1990] have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC, giving 15-bit 32,768 colors at 800x600,  some of the very newer ones [~6/92] can do 24 bits per pixel [usually  at 640x480].  Speedwise, too much variation, some very slow [Western Digital  Paradise based, for example], some very fast [S3 86C911 based, for example],  some are so-so [like Tseng ET4000, a very popular chipset].  Some limiting  factors overcome by 40MHz VL Bus & 386's linear address mapping were:  8.33 MHz ISA bus, AT architecture where the CPU looks at the card through a  64K "window", etc.Other non-SVGA standards: 8514/a: IBM's own standard, interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions  like linedraw, polygon fill, etc. in hardware. Some clone implementations  from ATI are the fastest video available today, though some clone models do  not have interlacing. TMS34010/34020: high end graphics co-processors, usually >$1000, some do 24-bit, speeds up vector-oriented graphics like CAD.XGA:  eXtended Graphics Array newer and faster than 8514/a, only available for MCA bus-based PS/2s, clones  are coming out soon.  Emulates VGA, EGA, and CGA (DCT).  Max resolution at  1024x768x8b, same as 8514/a, also some 16 bpp modes.XGA-2 Accelerates graphics functions up to 20 times faster than standard VGA in Windows and OS/2, including line draws, bit and pixel-block transfers, area fills, masking and X/Y addressing. Has an intelligent way to detect and co- exist with other XGA-2 cards, so multiple desktops like on the Mac may not be  far away.  Since this is an architecture, its resolution and color depth  isn't fixed {IBM implements only 16-bit [65,536] color, while other  companies can have 24-bit color through IBM technical licenses}. Refresh  rates up to 75 Hz, ensures flicker free, rock solid images to reduce visual  discomfort, and is VGA compatible. Up to 1280x1024 on OS/2.*some monitor types usable by Mac-See Mac section above for specific details.ExpansionBoth Mac & IBMSCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM. Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card  expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.   Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal  terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port  {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the  end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave} and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  Difference is due to SCSI-1 software drivers.  "Fast SCSI-1" is a misname for 8-bit SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode {see SCSI-2 for details}.SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully SCSI-1 compliant and 8-bit SCSI-2 tends to be implemented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in   hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2 do.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 can use SCSI-1 software drivers and hardware at 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds and as such is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called "fast SCSI-1".  16-bit fast SCSI-2 requires a SCSI-2 software driver and SCSI-2 electronics but can still use the SCSI-1 ports.  Wide 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require a different SCSI port, electronics, and software driver from SCSI-1 {Which makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}.Mac SCSI: asynchronous SCSI-1 built-in standard since the Plus.  Even though  Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers, the OS SCSI Manager needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI interfaces.  As a result present SCSI-2 Macs use 8-bit SCSI-2 as a fast  asynchronous SCSI-1.  Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI-2 controller chip built-in (Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1))  though they lack some other parts of the hardware, like the wide SCSI-2 port  interface.  Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI-2, older NuBus  Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU.  Rumor-some Cyclone Macs {June} will come with a wide & fast SCSI-2 port standard  and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager.IBM SCSI:  SCSI-1 is not too wide spread yet, generally not bundled with  systems, except as add-on {EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable}. Like the Mac, 8-bit SCSI-2 is used as a very fast SCSI-1 by most controllers out there.  Unlike the Mac, IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI.MacMemory expansion: with a few exceptions the Mac has used non-parity 30-pin  8-bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus.  While 32-pin 9-bit parity SIMMs could be used in these Macs, only special IIcis could make use of the parity  feature {By convension both SIMM types are called 32-pin SIMMs}.  The IIfx  used 64-pin parity SIMMs.  The LC III, C610/650 and Q800 all use a new  72-pin SIMM that is accessable by 32-bits at a time and is used in IBMs. The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every memory location; if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is. Since Macs made before Feb 15, 1993 managed memory baced on data path, SIMMs  had to be installed in pairs {16-bit} or in sets of 4 {32-bit}.  The Centris  650 and Quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that  allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time.  If the SIMMs are the same  size are used then the memory is 'interleaved' across the two SIMMs resulting  in a 10-15% performance boost on RAM access (MacWorld Apr 93: 108-109).Printers, ADBs, and modems: built-in interfaces standard.Monitor interface and sound input: built-in on most present macs. PDS: Available in SE & all present non-Powerbook Macs. 16-bit {SE,  Portable, LC, LC II, Classic line} and 32-bit.  Operates at CPU's MHz.   Maximum through put: data path in bytes*CPU's MHz {Q700/900 & C650:  4 * 25Mhz = 100MB/s; Q800 & Q950: 4 * 33Mhz = 132MB/s}. Standardized with the LC and 040 bus designs.  With an adapter one NuBus card can be used in  IIsi and C610.  Problem: some cards have timing dependency which slows  through put down.NuBus Mac II: 32-bit, 10 MHz bus clock, 1-to-1 transaction/bus cycle ratio, and contiguous, hand-shake transactions at ~10-20MB/s; theoretical peak: 40MB/s.  Built-in on all Modular Macs except the LC series, C610, and  Performa 400.  The SE/30 could be adapted to use this and there was even a  Mac Plus SCSI NuBus.  Supports every possible expansion from CPU to Ethernet  to DMA.NuBus 90: NuBus Mac II back compatable. 20MHz bus clock, avg throughput: ~30MB/s; burst mode: 80MB/s.  Future card designs will be 7" instead of the  old 12".QuickRing:  A peer-to-peer bus used in parallel with NuBus 90.  Apple's  VLBus - "Architecture is identical to that of VLBus" (Byte 10/92:128). Burst mode: 350MB/s (Byte 10/92:128). In development.CPU expansion: handled either through the PDS or the NuBus.  Unlike PDS,   Nubus CPU cards {example-Radius Rocket} allow use of multiple processors at  the same time.  This is like having two or more Macs in the same box able to  dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved {Each  NuBus card needs its own memory but most NuBus cards of this type come with  8MB RAM SIMMs on the card standard}.IBMMemory expansion:  parity SIMMs, non-parity SIMMs {some newer models do a Mac-like SIMM memory check}, or a dozen or so different types of memory boards.HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: MFM:  Modified Frequency Modulation, RLL:  Run Length Limited only used with smaller [ 60mb] hard drives.IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics  Asynchronous {~5MB/s max} and synchronous {8.3MB/s max} transfer. currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized  drives. Can have more than one hard drive. ESDI:  Enhanced Small Device Interface ~1.25MB/s throughput. generally considered better interface than SCSI-1 in many ways but not common enough for practical consideration.  Outside of hard drives, device choices are very limited compared to SCSI-1. BUS interfaces{New 'plug and play' ISA and EISA compatable cards may have problems working with old cards (InfoWorld; PC Week 03/08/93; Vaporware 4/93).}ISA 8 & 16-bit interfaces common. Has 24-bit data path limit {which produces a 16MB limit for which there are software workarounds} (PC Mag 4/27/93:105). 1.5 MB/s (Byte 3/93:132).  Uses edge-triggered interrupts, can't share them, hence comes the IRQ conflict.  Limited busmastering capabilities, some cards aren't bandwidth limited {COM  ports, LPT ports, game ports, MIDI card, etc.} while others are {video and disk controllers}.  Dominant factor, but it's showing its age.  Most ISA motherboard designs are 16-bit (PC World Feb 1993: 144-5)}.  MCA {Micro Channel} IBM's 16 and 32-bit bus; "allows use of more than one CPU in a computer"  (DCT) and anything can talk to anything, as fast as the two components  involved can handle it. Never took off because it was incompatible with ISA  and EISA.  Planned to be bus interface of IBM PowerPC 601 (Carl Jabido).EISA {NuBus Mac II is closest Mac equivalent} 32-bit, 8.33 MHz, burst mode: 33MB/s.  It also has the ability to  self-configure cards like MCA and allows multiple bus masters, sharable  interrupt and DMA channels and multiple CPU use.VESA Local Bus: VLB {Sometimes mistakenly refereed to as PDS} Local Bus standard. Runs at CPU clock rate,  Burst modes: ~130 MB/s{32-bit} 250 MB/s{64-bit} (Byte 10/92:128).  Limited to three slots but allows bus  mastering and will coexist with either ISA or EISA. Consitered ideal for  video and disk I/O.  DELL has filled a claim that this violates one of their patents (Mel Martinez).QuickRing: Apple's faster {350 MB/s burst} version of VLB architecture (Byte 10/92:132).  Might show up in some IBM and PowerPC machines (Byte 10/92:132-133). In development.PCI Intel's version of Local Bus that is intended to totally replace  ISA/EISA/MCA.  In development.OSes {assumes full installation [print drivers, fonts, Multifinder, etc.]and multiple application use.}Mac512K to 1MB of OS and hardware commands have been put into ROM.  This allows Apple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the Mac OS {QuickDraw, menu commands, print, mouse, SCSI & sound drivers, etc} in ROM, which require clone makers to use the ROM chip or read ROM on to disks {Which requires access to the proper Mac since different Macs have slightly different ROM chips; Plus vs Classic for example.}  With key hooks for the OS support interface in ROM, programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk OS has the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and therefore can write smaller programs.  This also allows Apple greater control over hardware-software standards and that the disk OS can be smaller and, with some of the tookbox command code in ROM, with lower RAM requirements then a totally disk based OS.  Macs use Masked ROM which is as fast as DRAM (Jon Wtte).6.0.7: Single program usage base requirements: 1 MB and DD floppy,  cooperatively-multitasking base requirements: 2MB and HD floppy.   Features a GUI, cooperative-multitasker [MultiFinder], standard program  interface, & standard stereo sound support [snd]. Network receiving part of  AppleShare software is bundled with the OS. Has a 8MB RAM barrier and is a  24-bit OS. Some third party products allow 14MB of Virtual Memory as long as  real RAM is below 8MB.6.0.8: 6.0.7 with 7.0.0 print drivers.6.0.8L:  System 6 for some Macs that require System 7.0.X.7.0.X: Base requirements: 2MB, 40MB Hard Drive, and 68000; De-facto standard  to run all features well: 4MB, 80MB Hard Drive, and 68030 {lowest present  non-portable Mac configuration}.  Using up to 10.08MB {This is EVERYTHING on system disks} of hard disk space this has 6.0.7 features plus program linking  within and between computers [IAC], built-in server capabilities {Filesharing  can be used by older OSes using AppleShare Client software and can be  accessed by 10 macs max; 4-5 is more speed practical, IAC requires 7.X},  Virtual Memory in machines with MMU{1.6 times real RAM for least noticeable  IIsi speed degradation}, drag and drop, QuickTime & built-in TrueType  support.  Supports sound input [AIFF and snd formats] for most present  machines.  Can access up to 1GB of true RAM and 4GB of virtual memory and is  both a 24 and 32-bit OS.  To use real RAM beyond 8MB it must be in 32-bit  mode and on older machines requires the 'Mode 32' extension.  Apple's last  'free' OS.7.1.0: 7.0.1 with WorldScript support, speedier, and less RAM usage than  7.0.dot (MacWeek 8/24/92; 9/14/92; PC Week 9/7/92). To run in 32-bit mode  on older machines it requires the 'Mode 32' or '32-Bit Enabler' extension.  Marks the start of Apple saling its Mac OS instead of allowing free upgrades {Bundled with new machines, $49 for 7.0.X upgrades, $99 otherwise}. [The installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system  fonts from the previous system inside the system file.  This can eat up any  RAM benefits and cause other problems.  Apple itself recommends removing all  fonts from the system file.]A/UX 3.0 [UNIX]: Needs 8MB RAM {12-20MB suggested}, 160MB hard drive, and  a 68030 or 68040 equivalent to run.  This 32-bit preemptive multitasking OS  is large due to being UNIX and needing translators between it and the Mac  ROMs.  Price: $709.Note: sound output was supported in OSes 3.2 to 6.0.5 by many formats including the following:  snd, WAVE, ASND, FSSD, QSSN, SMSD, SOUN, dc2d, and DCFL.  In 6.0.7 the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards 'snd' and AIFF which causes some playback problems for the old formats, though most still play.IBM Machiness have little GUI code, data, and hooks present in hardware for programmers to work with, so most of the coding must be provided in the OS.  Since hard disks were slow the disk OS code is read into RAM.  In addition, what little ROM code there is also read into RAM {a process called Shadow ROM}  This results in faster implementation since RAM is faster then PROMS or EPROMS.  Having most of the OS code on disk has the advantage of being able to better optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which is harder with a ROM based system due to the 'patches' needed.  In addition it reduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware support is needed.Side note:  The FTC charged that MicroSoft formed a OS trust by not providing all feature documentation for its OSes to developers outside MS and designing its Windows and DOS apps to fail under OS/2 ("Undocumented Windows") and "There is deliberate code in [Windows] NT Beta which causes the install to abort if OS/2 Boot Manager is present" (Gregory Hicks, Info-IBMPC Digest V92 #201).  Due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the FTC judicial council for action against Microsoft was a tie which resulted in no action.  Rumors-the FTC will presue the matter, likely to the point of choosing a new member or whole new council.  In addition the government has turned down Microsoft's copyright of "Windows" which would allow it to charge a fee for developers using their hooks (PC Week 03/08/93).MicroSoft OSesDOS 5.0: Has a 640K barrier with its own memory manager, a 1 MB barrier  with third party memory managers.  This 16-bit OS requires that each program  must provide its own print drivers and be 16-bit {Programs need to be DOS  Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) compliant and running on a 386dx [32-bit  Protected Mode] to break these barriers}.  Contains the GUI shell present in DOS 4.0.DOS 6.0: DOS 5.0 with the added features of a built-in file compresion, disk  defragmenter, debugger for the CONFIG.SYS file. It needs a $80 module for  networking {Cost: $50 through 5/93, after that $129.99}  (Byte April 1993:44-46).DOS 7.0: 32-bit DOS. In development (PC Week 04/05/93).Window 3.0: Runs on top of DOS.  Breaks 640K and 1M barriers but still has to  deal with DOS file structure.  Base requirements: 1MB, floppy and 286; to run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx and fast display adapter {> 8-bit}.  Has the equivalent of Mac's QD called Windows GDI [Graphics Device Interface]. This does not have a consistent application interface {Like early Mac programs  (1984-1985)} nor a very large program base {compared to DOS} and still tends to slow the machine down (Info-IBMPC Digest V92 #186) with speed is more dependent on the display adapter then on the CPU (Bill Coleman). Window programs tend to be disk and memory hogs compared to their DOS counterparts (Byte April 1993:98-108).Window 3.1: A faster version of Window 3.0 with better memory managment. Base  requirements 1 MB, hard drive and a 286 ;to run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx.  Apple plans to release its print drivers for this (PC Week 12/28/92).Windows for Workgroups:  To run well: 4MB RAM and 386dx (PC World Feb/93:160).   Intermediary between Win 3.1 and Windows NT.  It is basically Windows 3.1  with built-in peer to peer networking support.Windows NT:  Beta release takes about 50MB of disk space [including the  swap file], and 12MB RAM {Betas are notorious for RAM usage especially in  the interaction between debuging code and program compliers, hence the  reports of 24MB requirements}.  Released version supposed to need 8MB RAM  but, Gates himself now recommends 16MB RAM (PC Week 04/15/92). This 32-bit OS has Protected mode multitasking, multithreading, symmetric  multiprocessing, a recoverable file system, and 32-bit GDI.  Has built in networking that is OSF DCE compliant and can handle up to 4GB of RAM.  Even though some people see a July 4 release date (InfoWorld Nov 16/92), rumor is that the final version will not be available before Oct 1993 (InfoWorld May 25/92; July 6/92; Vaporware 07/92; 08/92) or 4th quarter 1993 (PC Week 09/28/92). Windows upgrades will be $295, otherwise $495 (PC Week 04/15/92; 03/15/93).Other OSesPC-DOS 6.0: IBM's version of DOS 6.0.  It runs Windows much faster then DOS  6.0 due to faster file I/O and video handling (InfoWorld Feb 1, 93).DR DOS 6.0: same as DOS 5.0 with some extras {like built-in data compression}  and memory management enhancements. Still has 640K/1MB barrier.  A later  version {Novell DOS} of this may use a version of the Mac finder and Apple  file management system (PC Week 12/14/92; InfoWorld Dec 14/92).OS/2 2.0: Unix like features and unix like requirements; 8-16MB RAM, 60MB {uses 17-33MB} hard drive, and 386dx CPU. This 32-bit multithreaded,  multitasking OS can address up to 4GB of RAM but has to use a fast swap file  to use more than 16 MB RAM on ISA systems using DMA {Direct Memory Access}.  IBM plans to use Taligent's OOPS in future versions of this  (InfoWorld Oct 26/92).AIX:  IBM's UNIX system, planned to be a subset of PowerOpen and Taligent OS.NeXTStep: GUI UNIX to provide NeXT features on IBM machines.  Beta out, final  version to be out by May 25, 1993.Solaris OS for x86: a SunSoft port.  A 32-bit OS with symmetric  multiprocessing and multithreading, built-in networking capabilities with  tools to allow remote configuring and adminstration features, and  communication package.  Client: $795,  50 users server: $1,995, 1000s users server: $5,995.  Developer kits-software: $495, hardware: $195.Mac 7.1 [working name: Star Trek]:  Apple had System 7.0 running off Intel  Chips and is looking at making a 7.1 version available for IBM  (ComputerWorld Nov 2/92; MacWeek 03/22/93). At present this is planned to run  on top of Novell's DR DOS, require a 486 or equivalent to run and that apps  will need to be recompiled (MacWeek 03/22/93).  Viewed as Novell's answer to  Windows NT.  The complexity of PC hardware set ups is one reason for slow  progress {This seems to Apple/IBM's way of leading to the PowerPC line out in  late 1993/early 1994 and Pink OS in late 1994-early 1995.}PowerPCRumor-IBM will build its PowerPC 601 by late 1993 (InfoWorld June 8 & 15, 92; MacWeek 7/13/92; PC Week 3/15/93).  It will have MicroChannel bus and XGA video (Carl B Jabido), and will run native version AIX and Mac apps (PC Week 3/15/93); there have been no comments on compatablity of DOS or Windows apps.Apple's PowerPC 601 machine {Tesseract} is planned to be out Jan 24, 1994 and to have MC98601/50 MHz, 4/8MB RAM, a 2.8-Mbyte floppy drive and expected to sale near LC line prices {~$2000, down from projections of ~$3000 (MacUser 9/92:146)}(MacWeek 3/22/93).PowerOpen [A/UX 4.0]: A 32-bit preemtive multitasking OS planned to run on PowerPCs and 68030/40 Macs (MacWeek 7/13/92).  Intel compatibility uncertain (See Mac 7.1 above).  Planned base requirements:  68030, 8MB RAM, 80MB hard drive (MacWeek 4/19/93). Rumor-ahead of schedule; COULD be out by mid 1993. Rumor-this could be the OS for IBM's PowerPC 601 which is due by late 1993.Pink [Taligent OS]: Expecting delivery in 1994 (Wall Street Journal 1/12/92)  and may have some parts shipping in OS/2 and AIX in 1993 and Mac OS and  PowerOpen with the PowerPCs (MacWeek 01/25/93).Windows NT: Possible port (MacWeek 04/05/93).  See IBM OS section for details.Solaris OS: Version of this Sun Microsystems Inc UNIX OS to run on the Power PCs in 1994 (MacWeek 04/05/93).  One of the few OSes to directly state  that it will run Windows/DOS programs.  IBM OS section for detailsNeXTStep: possible port see IBM OS section for details.OS Number Crunching (Mel Park)Mac Arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment {SANE or Standard Apple Numerics Environment}. Floating point numbers are 96 bits long when an FPU is present and 80 bits otherwise. Exceptions, such as dividing by zero or taking the square root of a negative number, do not cause an abort but are handled in a logically consistent manner. 1/0 produces the internal representation for infinity (INF).  1/(1/0) produces zero. The above treatment of 1/(1/0) occurs in an FPU-equipped machine even when SANE is bypassed and the FPU programmed directly.IBM Floating point numbers are 80-bits with a hardware FPU, 64-bits when emulated.  The way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever compiler or assembler was used for a program. On older DOS complilers exceptions could cause program aborts; 1/0 and 1/(1/0) would abort to the DOS prompt at the point where they occured.  Most present compilers handle this better.  Result: there is little consistent handling of numbers between DOS, Windows and OS/2 programs nor between programs for just one OS.Networking [Includes printing]WYSIWYG printing can be a problem with either Mac of IBM machines especially if one sends TrueType fonts to a older style PostScript printer.MacHardware: Built-in LocalTalk network port and a built-in printer port.  LocalTalk has moderate speeds (230.4 Kb/s) requires special connectors for each machine ($15 and up) and can be run off of either the printer port {to include very old macs} or the network port {standard today}.  Built-in Ethernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at about $150-$300 for each machine.  These cards provide three connectors and transceivers {thick, thin, and 10BaseT} for Ethernet.The Macintosh Quadra family and some Centris models includes Ethernet interface on motherboard, with transceivers available. TokenRing has been a network option since 1989.Software: AppleTalk {the suite of protocols} standard with Mac OS, which can use variety of media types.  AppleShare client software included with the OS as well and can connect to file servers such as Novell Netware, 3Com 3+Open, Banyan Vines, DEC Pathworks, Apple's AppleShare servers, System 7 File Sharing machines, and AFP servers running on variety of UNIX hosts.  MacTCP allows typical TCP/IP communications (telnet, ftp, NFS, rlogin).  A later version will have Unix X/Open Transport Interface (XTI) built-in by the end of 1993 (MacWeek 04/12/93).  Third-party software to connect to NFS servers.  DEC Pathworks provides DECnet support.  Peer-to-peer file sharing software built-in to System 7.1 (See OS section).  Full server software is extra. Printing requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in the chooser.  Changing printers is by selecting a different name in the chooser.  The same is true of connecting to servers.Printing bugs:  Monaco TrueType font is different then the screen bitmap font. {QuickDraw QX is suppossed to fix this and similar problems.}IBM  Hardware: LocalTalk [not widely used], Ethernet,  and TokenRing.Software: Novell Netware, Banyan Vines, DECNet, Windows/Work Groups, AppleTalk protocols, and AppleShare {subset of AppleTalk}.Each of the MS-DOS networking schemes are, in general, totally incompatible with the others. Once you have chosen one, you are pretty much locked-in to that product line from then on.  Windows/Work Groups is a little more forgiving and removes some of this problem.  Novell Netware is the biggest, {~80 percent of the corporate market.} and in general is more powerful and offers better control/management/security than AppleShare, but it's also more complex to set up and manage.  This will change due to the use of the Mac finder and file management system by Novell. (PC Week 12/14/92 & 12/28/92;  InfoWorld Dec 14/92; MacWeek 3/22/93)Printing {Very OS dependent}DOS: If it's a single user, then you plug the printer into the parallel port,  and don't worry about it {Tweeking may be needed with poorly written  software}.  Network Printing is not controlled by the system, but is mostly  implemented by the actual program, therefore performance varies from one  software program to the next.Windows 3.x: supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing "jobs"  in the print queue, but it always lists printers as "active"... even if they  are not.  This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers  on the same net, because there's no way for software to reliably determine  which printer is active right now.  Windows for Workgroups is more Mac-like  and intelligent about this.OS/2: Mac-like; the os deals with printers, with apps making calls to the OS.Printing bugs: due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do not have WYSIWYG printing.  This is the fault of the programs in question and not that of the OS involved.Price issue: This is very dynamic with Mac providing more build-in features than IBM and IBM being more 'get only what you need' then Mac and price wars by both worlds.The IBM machines' modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware standarization, which in turn requires OSes and programs to be very complex to handle ALL the variation in hardware.  When one adds all the standard Mac hardware features to an IBM {built-in input/output sound support, SCSI, PDS,  built-in monitor support, built-in networking, standard mouse interface, and NuBus 90 in higher machines} the Mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent equipted IBM machine {Especially since some IBM monitors can be used with Macs which cuts some more of the Mac's cost (MacUser Aug 1992:158-176)}. Some prices using some of the info in this sheet and MacUser April 1993.All Macs below come with a PDS slot, VRAM, and SCSI-1 built in.  Except where noted, monitor is extra and a built-in monitor interface is provided {no card needed except for 24-bit color display}.IBM planned a $1,200 386SLC/25MHz model with a 60MB hard drive and color VGA monitor {~VRAM} (MacWeek 8/17/92) {sounds like a Color Classic without SCSI-1, sound support, built-in network support, FPU socket, built-in expansion to 16-bit color, etc}.Color Classic:  $1,389 - 030/16MHz with 16-bit data bus {~386sx/20MHz equivalent}, 4/80, FPU socket, and built-in monitor.LCIII: $1,499 - 030/25MHz {~386dx/33MHz equivalent}, and 4/160.Centris 610: $2,899 - 68LC040/20MHz {Depending on the program ~486sx/40 or ~'486dx2sx'/20[40]MHz equivalent}, 8/230, built-in ethernet, 300i CD-ROM, a PDS/NuBus 90 slot and VRAM for 16-bit color.Centris 650: 040/25MHz {Depending on the program ~486dx/50 MHz or 486dx2/50 MHz equivalent} with a PDS and 3 NuBus 90 slots. $3,189 {ethernet, 8/80}; $3,559 {ethernet, 8/230}; $3,999 {ethernet, 8/230, CD-ROM, VRAM for 16-bit color}Bibliography notes'Vaporware' is available in the digest/vapor directory by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu [36.44.0.6] and was by Murphy Sewall {last issue: April 93.}'Info-IBMPC Digest' back issues are available from wsmr-simtel20.army.mil in directory PD2:<ARCHIVES.IBMPC>'Dictionary of Computer Terms 3rd ed.'

 64It seems that there are a lot of questions regarding the Cyrix 386 compatible486DLC and 486DRU2.  My info comes directly from Cyrix's Fast Fax service:And also from installing one of these chips in an IBM Model 80.The 486DLC is a 486 instruction set compatible CPU which fits into a 386DXsocket (Pin Grid Array, or PGA).  The DLC currently is available in 3 speeds.the 25, the 33, and the 40.  They do not have a coprocessor on board, but anysoftware query will return coproc as present.  I guess they emulate thecoproc instructions.  Math functions are on the 386DX level without theactual coprocessor.The internal cache on the 486DLC is 1K.  Cyrix literature claims a 85% hitrate.  My informal tests show that the cache accounts for a 10% performanceboost when it is enabled by software.  Overall performance boost from a386DX-25 to a 486DLC-25 is about 60%.  The benchmarks I used were NU SI andQAPlus Dhrystones and Whetstones.  The performance, with the cache enabled,is about on a par with my 386DX-40 with 256K external CPU cache, which isaround the performance for a 486SX-25.  The computer runs noticebly faster,and DOS 6 with Dblspace is not complaining.  The company claims OS/2compatibility, but I didn't test it.The 486DRU2 is not a chip, as commonly thought.  The 486DRU2 is actuallya small daughterboard slightly larger than the 386DX, which containsthe logic to manage the clock doubler.  This board plugs into the 386DXPGA, and the 486DLC-33 or 40 plugs into this board.  I guess the boarddoubles the frequency apparent to the CPU, and insert wait states when access to the rest of the system is required.  There are no info availablefrom Cyrix there.  Anyway, the DRU2 is available for 386DX-16, and 386DX-20only.  Double these clock rates, and you get the 32MHZ and the 40MHZ DLCs.If Cyrix is planning to do the same thing for the DRU2-50, then they needto put out the 50MHz DLC2 first...I also tested a DLC33 motherboard, along with a Cyrix Coprocessor.  With 64Kexternal cache, performance were about 30% faster than the 25, but stillsignificantly (25%?) slower than an actual Intel 486DX.IMHO, the DLC is a great, low price upgrade for people who can't afford, orcan't install, a new motherboard.  It is definitely worth what I paid for it,but if you need 486DX-33 performance, the DLC33 won't cut it.  I'm not sureabout the DLC-40, but I think even if it matches the performance, it won'tbeat it in any significant way.The last time I posted info about the DLC, people sent quite a bit of mail,asking where I got it.  So here is where I got mine:Treasure Chest peripherals, they advertise in the Computer Shopper.1-800-677-9781The 486DLC-25 kit was $179.00But....I liked the chip so much that I found the supplier, and became a dealer.If you are interested in the chip, e-mail me, and I can fax or mail youmore info.   I'm well aware of the net's policy against commercial use,So I can;t post anymore info here.  However, if there are more questionsregarding the 486DLC itself, I'll post what I can.jamesc909-396-0408-- =========================================If someone asks if you are a God, you say... YES!

Many adds don't even mention the DX 50.The 50 MHz external bus speed provides a hell for cache designs. Mostof the DX-50 boards have too slow caches that make them effectivelyDX2-50:s. Also as someone else pointed out, local bus boards arebetter off at 33 MHz bus speed. The 8k internal cache allows theDX2-66 to be generally faster anyway.--Segmented Memory Helps Structure Software

SCSI is used almost exclusively on these systems.A SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request datafrom the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the dataand moves it to memory.  A controller that allows reselection can operateeven better with multiple devices.  This is espically true with SCSI tapeunits.  For example, when rewinding or formatting a tape, the command isissued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to otherdevices on the bus.  This greatly increases productivity or, at least, dosomething else while backing up your hard drive :-).  Which happens to bewhat I am doing while reading this group.Its a long story, but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which,thanks to SCSI, I can move between both machines.  If, and when, SCSI isbetter standardized and supported on the ibm-clone machines, I plan tocompletely get rid of IDE.--  Wayne Summer        //        AMIGA - Simply the Best.  Palm Bay, FL.

It's now clear, well-focussed and has no pincushioning or barreldistortion at all. I'm very happy with it, and the digitalcontrols and mode memory are nice.

And how much would it cost?Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if Iwere to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD?And how much would it cost?Thanks for any comments.Randy

Works just great.   If you need even more, there's a text file floating around somewhere thatdetails how to hack up any serial card (and probably any others) to work on thehigher IRQs. It basically involves cutting the trace to the low IRQ and running a wire over the a high IRQ pin on the 16bit expansion bus.  It will be best to put the modem's COM port onto IRQ2/9. This will be the first IRQ serviced by the system, giving the modem a better response -- especially handy under multitaskers like OS/2 -- which I'm running with noproblems.Justin---jdolske@andy.bgsu.edu

I get 'Data error on drive C' messages when reading some files. The problem isalso steadily getting worse.I have run some diagnostic software (PCTools V7.1) and it says that thedrive is OK - but it does have to retry some sectors and it briefly flashes up an error message (which is too quick to read).Does anybody know of any cheap or free software which could mark thesesectors as bad (DOS doesn't) or preferably perform a low level format.I have heard that the latter is possible on an IDE. Technical answerswould be appreciated. It would be nice to be able to use the disk again!!!I am running MS-DOS 5 on an AT clone.

Neither systems could actually run a program out of main memory, since DRAM is still too slow for that high of bus speed ( 60ns = 16.66MHz < 50MHz ).-rdd--- . WinQwk 2.0b#0 .

 9 Has anyone here dealt with Tangent?  I'm looking at an 486 system they have that has an EISA backplane with a VESA slot for video. The SCSI contoller they use is made by Aorta.  I've never heard of this brand.  Can anyone comment on Tangent or the controller? Thanks, David

Will the higher: resolution be noticed for these?: If you are talking about laser jet 4 then I believe it has to be postscript.I don't see any advantage to using PCL when you have a peice of hardwareplugged into the LJ4 that is doing the work and it can support any languagethat is suited for the job.  Besides I don't think PCL is even capable ofhandling 1200 dpi specifications.  I only have experience with the LaserMaster Winjet 1200 which brings the LJ4 up to 1200 dpi and it uses postscript.It also has a fast print mode which is not postscript, and it is at a lowerresolution (600dpi I think), but it is FAST!!!!  This particular productuses your host processor to process the postscript, so even with a decentPC you know it's going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high-end workstationprocessed PS.The quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (forthe PS processing) - I'm rather impatient.We were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image wasaccepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which convertsthe image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscriptprocessor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when itis done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can alsoaccept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications, butWindows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor isresponsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Ourcamera images came out very good in my opinion.  (not as good as Laser Master'sdemo though).I don't know how many other similar products are out there but I would besurprised if there are several.Gordon Lang

How do I knowwhich to use?2.) Head Skew & Cylinder Skew -- I understand that these are related toperformance... How do I know what's optimal?My drive is an ESDI drive, if that makes a difference in discussingthese terms.Any info/help is greatly appreciated!David(carlson@ucunix.san.uc.edu)

This is because it's like te PC AT hard diskinterface.  The controller moves a sector to some buffer memory on thecontroller card, then the CPU moves the data from the buffer to mainmemory where it's needed.  If IDE doesn't work this way, then it's notcompatible.Heck, if IDE used DMA, then you'd hear all kinds of complaints aboutISA bus systems with more than 16M RAM not working with their IDEdrives.  16M is the DMA addressing limit of the ISA bus, and if IDEdid DMA there would be trouble.(BTW, there are DMA-enabling signals in the IDE cable spec, but thelast report I heard was that they are never implemented, because itwould require a different kind of IDE adapter and different drivers.)-- Richard Krehbiel                                 richk@grebyn.comOS/2 2.0 will do for me until AmigaDOS for the 386 comes along...

 25I was wondering if anyone out there has had the same problem I am having withmy Gateway 2000 486-33DX VL-Bus system with ATI Graphics Ultra Pro LB.  When I have my computer in any resolution other than 800x600, everything isfine, but whenever I use it in 800x600 (Windows, AutoCAD, GIFs) the screen gets about 1 1/2 inches shorter.  At the very top and very bottom of the screenthere is about a 3/4" bar of black.  The screen isn't cut off, it just squeezeseverything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio.  While I canmanually change the V-Size on the back, this is a pain in the ass, and it justshouldn't happen anyway.  I've called Gateway numerous times and they haven't been able to help me at all.  Two different times they sent me a new card, andboth times the new card didn't work at all in my computer.  They even triedto bill me for the first card because they didn't get it back in a couple ofdays, when they TOLD me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeksbefore billing my card.  But their customer support is a different story...So, if anyone has had this same problem, please let me know if you know whatto do.  Hell, let me know if you don't have a solution, just so I know I'mnot the only one with this problem.  Thanks in advance.Jude M. Greerjmgree01@starbase.spd.louisville.eduP.S.  I already tried going into the MACH 32 install program and manually set-ting up the card.  Doesn't work.  Whenever I try to increase the vertical sizeof the 800x600 screen, it just starts to cut off the top and bottom.

 19I have a question for y'all:I'm looking at an ad for the new 3.5" FAST SCSI-2 drives from Micropolisin the June, 1993, MacWorld. (I have seen similar ads for the IDE versionsin IBM PC magazines)Well, the ad says that all three drives have a FAST SCSI-2 interface,but then it says that the DTR rate for each drive is 5 megabytes/second,*max*.How can this be?  I thought that if a drive was to be FAST SCSI-2 ithad to have a DTR of 10megs a second?(I am assuming the 5megs/sec claim by Micropolis is from the 512k cache.I admit that I would be very impressed if the drive can *read/write* dataat 5megs a second!)Thank you.

No, it's not true.  You can get SCSI and IDE to work together, butthere are restrictions (at least with the Adaptec 1542):* You MUST boot from the IDE drive.  There is no way to boot from the  SCSI drive if you have both IDE and SCSI drives.* You MUST disable the SCSI ROM BIOS (I'm not sure about this, though),  and so you must also use some special drivers to access the SCSI  drive.

Will there be a noticable>     decrease in access time/increase in Xfer rate?     For MSDOS applications, ISA-based SCSI and IDE controllersgenerally have comparable throughput.  You might get slightly higherthroughput with a SCSI disk, but you'll also pay more for the disk($30-$100 and up, in some cases).  You'll also pay much, much more for agood SCSI controller.     Note that good SCSI controllers really show their power if they'reused with a good multitasking operating system (like a PC Unix).Unfortunately, neither MSDOS nor Windows 3.1 is a good multitaskingoperating system.  The performance advantage of SCSI controllers ismostly wasted with these, which leaves the advantage of being able toconnect multiple devices to the SCSI bus as the only advantage.However, note that you can expect to pay a premium for SCSI devices.     If you're only going to be using MSDOS, stick with IDE.  It'scheaper, and you'll have less headaches.> 4)  Will virtually any SCSI device chain into the controller for my>     hard-drive (bernoulli box, CD-rom, Tape Drive, etc).[ Note: the following is true for MSDOS/Windows only.  Who knows what  the future holds for Windows NT and Unix??? ]     No.  Generally, you have to find drivers for each SCSI device,which probably don't exist unless you're using one of the "better"/"highperformance" SCSI controllers.  These are typically bus-mastering SCSIcontrollers that cost around $180-$400 (street prices) and up, anddrivers that allow you to connect these controllers to popularname-brand SCSI devices either come with the card, or can be purchased(for under $100 list price).  Examples of such driver kits are:* Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit (list: $75).  This works only with Adaptec SCSI  controllers.* CorelSCSI! (from the same people who make CorelDRAW!) (list: $99 (?)).  This driver kit will supposedly work with any SCSI controller card  that has an ASPI driver, like the Adaptec.     Central Point's PC Tools for DOS 8.0 supports a number of SCSI tapedrives (the documentation lists 40 tape drives).  Unfortunately, itworks only with Adaptec controllers.> 5)  Are there likely to be other problems/incompatibilities with a>     SCSI controller and  sound cards/video accelerators/and similar>     equipment.     Yes, you will run into problems, if you're using ahigh-performance, bus-mastering SCSI controller.  This doesn't soundright, doesn't it?  It's true, though.  With one of these controllers,you'll probably have to tweak your system to get it to work with soundcards, floppy-controller-based tape drives (like the CMS Jumbo 250), andWindows 3.1.  I know.  I've been to h*ll and back getting my SCSIcontroller to work with various hardware/software (thank God for tapebackups).  If you want a copy of my "Adaptec 1542 hints and tips" file,send email.     These problems aren't really the fault of the SCSI controller card;the problems are really with the general hardware and software design ofthe PC (e.g., no standards).  However, adding a bus-mastering SCSI cardis what brings these problems to the surface and makes them visible.     SCSI holds a lot of promise, but you can run into a lot of PCcompatibility problems.  If you're planning on using only MSDOS/Windows3.1, stick with IDE.  If you want to use Windows NT or a PC Unix, you'llhave to make some hard decisions: a good SCSI controller and more thanone SCSI hard disk will probably give you excellent performance, at thepossible cost of MSDOS compatibility.  [ I say, "probably", because,while I know this to be true with a PC Unix, I don't know if this reallywill be true of Windows NT.  I suspect that it will, but I don't knowfor sure.  ]

My>computer is a DTK 286-12 IBM clone.Simple.  First, Andrew is correct, although I can see where there might besome confusion.  It is indeed possible to have two cards *configured* to usethe same interrupt.  They can not *share* the interrupt in the sense that itis not possible to have both cards active at the same time.Here is an example.  For some time, I was short of "free interrupts."  I had atape controller (not a "floppy tape") that needed one of IRQ0-IRQ7.  (It's an*old* tape drive.)  My solution was to use IRQ3 (also used for COM2, where mymodem is).  I did this because I reasoned I would never be using the modem andthe tape simultaneously.  When kermit runs, it installs its own interrupthandler for IRQ3 and uses the serial port.  If the tape drive were to generatean interrupt, kermit would not have a clue what to do with/for the tapecontroller.  (And since the tape controller would not be serviced, it wouldmost likely "hang.")  Likewise, when the tape backup software runs, itinstalls an interrupt handler for IRQ3.  That handler won't do anything forthe serial port.Under DOS, printing is NOT interrupt-driven.  Instead, the BIOS polls thestatus of the parallel port to determine when another byte may be sent.That's why you can have your sound card and LPT1 both configured to use IRQ7.Try that on NT and see how far you'll get. :-)-- Kenneth R.

 60Facts:=====- A Netware Server 286A was roughly moved to a new location and left powereddown for three months.- From memory it has an 80 MB hard drive.- Manuals and original disks are for SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a- When powered up, the CMOS was wiped. A technician examined it and pronounced the disk drive unusable.My investigations indicate that drive C is a type 27 (1024 cylinders, 9 sides).When CMOS set this way, COMPSURF runs happily, with 13 bad blocks.I use PREPARE to Hotfix the one internal drive.Install will proceed "successfully", but when I try to boot the server, itreports that the software is not serialised for this hardware.Internal examination indicates that the keycard is present, and there is onedisk drive (or at least one large single unit). Attempts to configure a second drive in CMOS result in drive not readyerrors.Questions:=========The software is Netware 286 Level II and I can see burnt on to the screenSFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a. However, to configure netware for level II(mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk, yes? So how is the Novell Server 286A normally configured?1. Can I install SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a as Level I, or is this whatis causing my serialisation error?2. Is the Novell Server 286A normally equipped with two hard drives, one ofwhich has failed?3. Would this mean I can not install the network software because it will notbe serialised for this hardware with a failed drive?4. What else can cause a serialisation error?5. What happens if the keycard fails?6. Am I doing something wrong? Can someone knowledgeable offer some commentsand guides.Thanks for your time.Apology:=======I appreciate that I have posted this request somewhat widely. As I'mdealing with somewhat archaic hardware and software I'm hoping that by castingmy net further, I'm more likely to capture someone who has met this systembefore. I believe I can justify the groups to which I am posting.

 12I just bought a new IDE hard drive for my system to go with the oneI already had.  My problem is this.  My system only had a IDE cablefor one drive, so I had to buy cable with two drive connectorson it, and consequently have to switch cables.  The problem is, the new hard drive's manual refers to matching pin 1 on the cablewith both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the IDE card.  Butfor the life of me I cannot figure out how to tell which way to plugin the cable to align these.  Secondly, the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them.I figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go intothe drives.  Does it matter which I plug into the "master" driveand which into the "Slave"?  any help appreciated.  thanks...

 35Hi there.  We just bought a 486 DX2/66 Gateway system with a 2 meg ATIUltra Pro video card.  Everything seems to work fine except for theWindows Drivers for 800x600 24 bit, and 800x600 and 1024x768 16 bitmodes.  The fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup,and within minutes of use, everything on the screen is totallyunintelligible.  Naturally, I called Gateway tech support to inquireabout this.  The technician asked me about the drivers, and I told him itwas version 1.5, build 59.  He told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers forthe ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work!!!  Is this true?  If so, I'm simplyamazed.  How could this be?  The strange thing is I would have expectedto see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the FAQ!!!).One very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that noneof the Windows Accelerator boards have working 16 and/or 24 bit driversfor Windows 3.1.  I easily challenged him on that because I've beenrunning a Diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now, and I havetested and used the 24 bit mode as well.  He then backed off and said:"Well, Diamond has been working on those drivers much longer."  Anyway, Ijust wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did aboutit.  Any feedback will be appreciated.The system configuration is:Gateway 486 DX2/66 Local Bus16 Megs RamSCSI HD & CD-ROMUltrastor 34F Local Bus SCSI controllerATI Ultra Pro Local Bus with 2MB VRAMDOS 6.0Windows 3.1Mach 32 drivers version 1.5 (build 59)Thanks in advance.-- Ali R.

I assume you mean it gives you a parity errorwhen it's enabled, and not when it's disabled.  How high will the count go onthe memory check at boot-up before this error occurs?  Does the system beepat all; if so what's the pattern of beeps?  The error could be occuring inCache memory (not so likely) or video memory, as well as the simms.The fact that you have AMI bios is not conclusive in determining the boardmanufacturer either.  Boards are made by thousands of small Taiwanese companies(among others) that buy the name brand chips and put them together with somesimm sockets to make your board.

I would like to know whether the Orchid card can do VGA as fast as the ATI card.  If so, it would appear to be a formidable competitor.

 26I've been intently following the MAG thread while waiting formine to arrive in the mail. There seems to be a lot ofcomplaints about minor alignment problems with the MX15F. Onearticle contained a comment that the owner called the factoryand was told that his screen rotation was within spec (1/4").Well, my monitor arrived last night and, sure enough, it hasa very noticable barrel distortion. It's not dramatic, but itis there and it is especially noticable when the image doesn'tfill the entire screen. The fact that it is worse on the rightside doesn't help matters.What I'm trying to find out is if these minor imperfectionsare the norm or are most of their monitors perfect? I don't wantto send it back and get one with the same or an even worseproblem. Does the factory consider this kind of thing normaland ship their monitors with less than perfect alignment? Are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections?-- ...............................................................:      Comments and opinions are mine - not BNR's             :: Doug Adcock                      adcock@bnr.ca              :: Bell-Northern Research           Research Triangle Park, NC :...............................................................

Motorolais expected to release the chip in volume by year end in twoconfigurations, running at 50 and 66 MHz with performance of 40 and 50SPECint89 marks, respectively, sources said. Floating-point performancefor the 3.6-volt processors will be even better, as their SPECfp89performance will be 60 and 80, respectively. The 601, a scaled-downversion of the Power 220 chip developed by IBM for its RS/6000workstations, will also include a 32K single buffered cache on the chipwith protocols to support Motorola's 64-bit multiprocessor 88110 busbuilt in. The chip, which is being designed initially to support theMicro Channel Architecture, is bus independent, so vendors could developPowerPC- based systems using a number of different architectures,including ISA, EISA, or Sun Microsystems Inc.'s S-bus design, one sourcenoted.According to sources familiar with the development effort, Motorola hasbeen extremely successful in developing the PowerPC as an inexpensivearchitecture, despite a complex design made up of more than 2.8 milliontransistors using a 0.6-micron technology. Initial chips are expected tobe priced from $300 to $400 -- only slightly higher than Intel Corp.'s486 processors -- but could be sold profitably for less than $100, onesource said.==== END REPOST ====

 11While rummaging through a box of old PC (5150) parts, I found a half-sizeboard that looks like a comm port board.  It was made by Forte Data Systems andhas a copyright date of 1986 on it.  The board provides a male 24-pin connectorand has 3 jumpers of 3 pins each, two labelled A B C.  I plugged it into my PCand ran Advanced diagnostics several times, changing the jumper positions eachtime, but the system did not recognise a comm port.Does anyone have a clue as to what this board might be or how to configure it?I could use another comm port if it's free.Bryan

I booted up, changed the CMOSsettings to reflect the a: drive as the 3.5 and the b: drive as the 5.25.The drive lights didn't come on, and there was a failure trying to read fromthose drives.I switched the cables back to their original positions, and then booted-up andrestored the original CMOS settings. The lights for the floppies came onduring this process, and they stay on for as long as the computer is on.I see that when there is a disk in a:, the drive is spinning, yet there seemsto be no disk access. MSD.EXE and Norton SI detect both drives, but when I try to get detailed information about a: or b:, Norton SI tells me that thereis no disk in the drive.Can anyone offer any suggestions?I'm in desperate need of help!!!Thank you for your time.Eric Balogbalog@eniac.seas.upenn.edu

 32   I have a 386DX clone, with a DTC ESDI controller and Toshiba 660mbytedrive. Since installing DOS 6.0, when I tried to re-install softwarefrom5 1/4 or 3 1/2 disks, when I mount the second..third..fourth disks, DOS6doesn't recognize that I have changed floppies. If I do a "DIR", I seethecontents of the previous diskette. The only way to get DOS to recognizethatdiskettes have changed, is to do a "label", and then to not label them.   Buying DOS 6.0 has been a colossal mistake. DOS 5.0 was stable, andworkedwell with my equipment. I have Superstor Pro, and DESQVIEW/X ( withQEMM, Manifest, etc), so there aren't any features of DOS 6 that I am using. IguessI should roll back to DOS 5.0 but I am wary of what will happen when Ido it.   Besides, like a fool, I don't have a DOS 5. bootable disk anymore.I'vemade the same mistakes I caution my users not to make. Like sheep, Ijoined the crowd flocking to DOS 6.

 38Wow, you guys are really going wild on this IDE vs. SCSI thing, and I thinkit's great!However, I think that some people (such as myself) would benefit from answersto the simple(?) question:  Which would YOU choose, and why?Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate fromthe hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), andwhat I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controllercard on my ISA 486-50.I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range.And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head)about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm gettingsomething like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).How would thisnumber compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, andthe state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what wouldYOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if Iwere to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD?And how much would it cost?I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hookup a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec.Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (andown the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port aSCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSIHD's SCSI-2?Thanks for any comments.Randy

I have been told by the motherboard vendor that I could probablyuse the supply if it had twelve wires going to the motherboard.(Apparently some XT vintage supplies had only 11 wires -- the12th wire is a 5v line used to charge the motherboard battery).My question is has anybody tried bringing an additional wireout of an 11 wire supply OR using an auxiliary power sourceto charge the motherboard battery?I do not wish to buy an entirely new power supply if I can make use of my existing one with simple hacks.Thank you for any information.

Ambiguous votes which cannot be returned to their senders or for which no clarification is provided will be identified in the final vote tally.Every Vote Counts........Feel free to Flood my mail!!!Rationale---------The rationale for this proposal is a need for those interested orinvolved in the publishing of cdrom materials to have a forum forthe discussion relating to their needs. At the moment the main forafor such discussion are in alt.cd-rom and comp.multimedia neitherof which have publishing as their focus. Some lists serve thegeneral cdrom community with focuses on library, government andnetwork usage, and until several weeks ago none were devoted to publishing (CDPub has just been setup). In any case a list is not,and ought not, be a replacement for regular usenet newsgroups. The reason for the division into three groups is a naturalpartition of interest between the hardware and software topics,and between the two main focal points of software, i.e. fulltextand multimedia publishing. Topics such as CDROM XA, CDI, CD-R, Photo CD and other related formats would be included as well. Topics related to cdrom publishing that are neither clearlyhardware or software related such as books, copyright issues andother legal matters, packaging, distribution, could be included inthe purvue of comp.publish.cdrom.software, as would any othernonhardware or multimedia topic that relates in some way to cdrompublishing, in any format, and is appropriate to the Internet. The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.software would be topics such asindex and retrieval software, premastering software, cdromsimulation software, hypertext, sgml, scanning and imagingsoftware, data capture software, data clean up, compression,encryption etc as relates to publishing cdroms. The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia would be software thataids in the multimedia authoring and publishing process - audio andvideo. The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.hardware would be hardware thatrelates to cdrom publishing, as well as hardware for data capture,such as all sorts of scanners and data capture hardware, as well asinformation that publishers need to know about the hardware thatthe intended enduser will utilize (the hardware that willeventually play the published cdrom) including networks for cdrom. Notes-----These groups are not to be used for topics such as reviews orquestions relating to already published cdroms or reviews orquestions relating to general purpose cdrom drives and the like.Requests for help in installing a cdrom drive and other generaltopics should be directed to other fora. Questions about cdromsmounted on LANs should be directed to bit.listserv.cdromlan. Charter------- Proposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.SOFTWARE The USENET newsgroup, comp.publish.cdrom.software, will be a newsgroup for discussion of the following example topics, but not limited to them: Index and retrieval software Authoring software Scanning and imaging software OCR and OCR cleanup Hypertext SGML Premastering and Simulation (cdrom) software Copyright and legal issues related to publishing cdroms Other nonhardware topics related to cdrom publishing Proposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.HARDWARE The USENET newsgroup, comp.publish.cdrom.hardware, will be a newsgroup for discussion of the following example topics, but not limited to them: CD-R equipment Data capture hardware Scanners Video and audio capture hardware Networking hardware Midi hardware Photo CD hardware Publishing systems CDI and DVI hardware Compression and encryption hardware Keyboarding Other hardware publishing topics Proposed Charter -- COMP.PUBLISH.CDROM.MULTIMEDIA The USENET newsgroup, comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia will be a newsgroup for discussion of the following example topics, but not limited to them: Multimedia authoring software Imaging software Audio and Midi software Color control software Video editing software Audio editing software Multimedia utilities useful for publishers Integration of text, image, audio and video Compression and encryption of multimedia Multimedia copyright and related legal issues Multimedia databases and hypertext Other multimedia publishing topics-- Henry Manaster          *     EMail: manaster@yu1.yu.eduBrooklyn, NY            *Disclaimer: The above is not necessarily MY opinion nor that of anyone else :-)  ????!

 18Is it possible to buy a serial I/O card with the 16550 UART's built in(rather than having to buy them separately, and socketing them in)?My current I/O card uses 8250's (correct number? The braindead ones anyway).It also controls two floppy drives, and two IDE hard drives.Ideally, I'd like to get a new multi I/O card, that had 2 serial ports with16550's and could also control another 2 IDE HD's. It would have to haveconfigurable addresses for both the serial ports, and the IDE controller, soit could co-exist with my existing card.Does such a beast exist? Now the hard part - where can I get one in Australia,preferably Brisbane?Thanks,Geoff Green (spart@cs.uq.oz.au)

 21I went out and bought the PAS16 yesterday, and installed it into my GatewayDX2-66V. I followed the instructions and set the SB side with DMA 1 and IRQ5(the default) and then the PAS side with DMA 5 and IRQ 10. My question is howshould I configure for MPU-401 compatibility. The manual and installationprogram recommended IRQ2, but on my machine it is configured to [cascade] toIRQ8-15. So can I still use IRQ2, or should I choose a different one? Right nowI have the MPU-401 emulation mode turned off. Actually what is this "cascade toIRQ8-15" business?  A related questions (to other GW or VL-bus machine owners) I was told that only DMA 5, 6, 7 are 16 bit DMAs, and 0-4 are 8 bit DMAs. Now what about32-bit VL-bus mastering DMAs?? Which DMA channel(s) is used by the VL-busextension to do 32-bit DMA?Yet another question, after installing PAS16, my Links (golf game) will hangthe machine when I select SB mode and run, but works with Adlib mode??Civilization however works fine ( at least so far).

 37HELP!!  This morning I turned on my computer..to be greated with a poppingnoise from the monitor.  I quickly looked thru the top right vent and tomy disbelief saw orange flame and smelled smoke!  Great...I opened it up to see what I could see (it's 4 years old, no warrenty for me).On one of the pc boards there was a resistor that had been majorlyfryed..burnt to a crisp..can't even tell what value it is.  This is theonly pjhysical damage I can find.  But to my knowledge, resistors don'tjust randomly blow.  What could have happened??  A voltage regulatorproblem..?  The fuses nearby are intact...great job.  I have 2 thoughts asto why it did this.  One, over the winter I was ruinning a humidifier forabout 6 weeks, although it was halfway across the room.  Could moisturedone this?  I last used it over a month ago.  Second, as most peopledo...I never use the power switches on the CPU or moinitor.  I haveeverything plugged into a surge protector and I turn the whole shebang onwith it.  Now, is this bad???  Should I quit doing it?  Is my systemgetting too much power or varrying power this way when activated?Now...before I take it to a repaoir shop I want to replace the resistor tosee what happens.  But I have no idea what value it is.  Or even if thatwould fix things..would it just blow again??  Right now, when I plug it inand turn it on I don't even get the power LED..a power supply prolem??Should I bother tracking down this resistor value or take it to a shop?? It is resistor R830.  It's near the metal shield thatshgields..something..near a large black electrolytic capacitor.  It's onthe right most pc board.  The monitor is an Imtec 1455N, from mid-1989.Does someone have schematics for this?  Or would someone be willing totake theirs apart and see what value R830 is???  Basically, what the hellshould I do to get this thing fixed for the cheapest amont in the least time.I have crosposted this article.  Please respond via email with any help orsuggestions.  Also, does anyone have Imtecs phone or address??  My manuallacks either from what I can see.  Please respons VIA EMAIL ONLY!!!Needless to say, with no computer I don't have the leisure of scanninggroups while bothering my friend to use his computer/modem.Help..this really bites and I need it working ASAP!!!

 75Organization: Brunel University, Uxbridge, UKSummary: Keywords: Subject: Video Feature ConnectorNewsgroups: comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware, comp.sys.ibmpc.misc, sci.electronicsOrganization: Brunel University, Uxbridge, UKSummary: Keywords: X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]Does anyone know how the VGA video feature connector operates? Iwould like to know which of the pins are inputs, which are outputs,and which are bidirectional (if any - and how the direction isselected).I have found a pinout for the connector:Video Feature Connector Pinouts.Pin     Name   Function1       PD0    Dac Pixel data bit 02       PD1                   bit 13       PD2                   bit 24       PD3                       35       PD4                       46       PD5                       57       PD6                       68       PD7                       79       -      Dac Clock10      -      Dac Blanking11      -      Horizontal Sync12      -      Vertical Sync13      -      Ground14      -      Ground15      -      Ground16      -      Ground17      -      Select Internal Video18      -      Select Internal Sync19      -      Select Internal Dot Clock20      -      Not Used21      -      Ground22      -      Ground23      -      Ground24      -      Ground25      -      Not Used26      -      Not UsedAnd I assume that pins 1 - 12 are outputs, and 17 - 19are inputs. Is this correct?The reason is this - I have a Rombo Media Pro+ videodigitising card. It chroma keys its output into the vgamonitor signal. However, although it is supposed to workwith an ET-4000 with Hi-colour RAMDAC, the colours on screenbehave as if the top 2 bits of colour information are missing,and red, green, blue signals are swapped around.Rombo has suggested that this may be due to insufficientbuffering on the feature connector outputs, and is happy tosell me a buffer device for 50 pounds.I would rather save about 45 pounds, and build my own. I assumeit would require (for example) a 74F244 buffer IC (or two).Can anyone help? Any information on the feature connector wouldbe highly appreciated!Please could you reply by email :ee90dhg@brunel.ac.ukbecause I am at home (easter holidays) and a 300 baud modemis slow for reading news!
